Australia&#8217;s first drive-in cinema, the Skyline, opened in Burwood, Melbourne in 1954, followed by the Lunar Drive-In in Dandenong in 1956, which is still operating. At the peak of their popularity, there were over 330 drive-ins across the country, before a downturn in the 1980s. Their place in popular culture was cemented when Ozploitation director Brian Trenchard-Smith used one as his futuristic prison in dystopian horror film Dead End Drive-In in 1986.</p>",

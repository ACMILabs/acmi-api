In one work, for example, she used phase-shift oscillators in order to synthesise sounds from controlled feedback. Electricity generated by a solar panel is fed into drawings (made up of pencil marks, silver and paper) that conduct, impede or collect electricity. A transistor and speaker attached to the drawing is wired for sound. In Aeritus (1998), a magnetic turbulence around ordinary objects (a fork, a knife and a chair) allows for a map of electronic flows through harmonic phase disturbance. Siphon (1997) stored electricity inside insulated jars. With these she created room-sized electronic circuits, with speaker magnets and voice coils emitting hums of electrons crashing into atoms. Her work has been shown in Australian Perspecta 1991 and the Biennale of Sydney 1992.

Originally trained as a painter, his work since the mid 'eighties has focused on combining time-based art forms such as video, sound and computer animation with static objects and images to create a vivid environment. Haines' work draws on pre-Rationalist magic to be found in the written word, when symbols were seen to be as powerful as the things they represented, from alchemical emblems to heraldry. Something of this is returned to signs in the age of 3D animation and graphics terminal design. For Haines, humour is a tool of disruption. Haines explores the underbelly of language, replete with bizarre hybridisations and deliberate misspellings. Medievalism-musical/non musical kingdoms was a major video work of 1997 involving multi video monitors and projections shown at Artspace, Sydney.

Daughter of director, James Benning, She began making video tapes at the age of fifteen, using a Fisher-Price PXL 2000 Pixelvision toy camera. Her early works were made in the privacy of her childhood bedroom, sometimes while skipping school. The quality of Benning's work is founded on her intense relationship with the camera, as both confidant and witness. She manages to evoke a sense of intimacy that goes beyond the revelations of a teenage diary. Her inventive use toys, of scrawled and handwritten text from posters and diary entries, complement the often terse expressions and associations of an identity that allows us to glimpse its longings and complexities. Her work manages to combine playful seduction with painful honesty. It emerges from a place half-innocent and half-adult, with all the honesty, humor, and real desperation of a personality trapped and uncomfortable, just coming to self-awareness.\n\nBenning received a Masters of Fine Arts from Milton Avery School of the Arts at Bard College in 1997. She has participated in museum exhibitions and festivals worldwide (Germany, Korea, France, Columbia, New York and California to name just a few places), has won numerous grants and awards, and has presented lectures and artists workshops. Her works can be found in various museum's permanent collections, and she has been featured in numerous broadcast and print publications. In an article for Art Journal in 1995, Bill Horrigan, Media Arts Curator at the Wexner Center for the Arts, described Benning as one of the handful of North American independent video producers of the past 10 years to have attracted sustained critical notice outside the circuits typically open to noncommercially minded media artists.\nReferences:\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 1, 35:00 min\nA New Year, 1989, 06:00 b/w;\nLiving Inside, 1989, 06:00 b/w;\nIf Every Girl Had A Diary, 1990 06:00 b/w;\nJollies, 1990, 11:00 b/w;\nMe And Rubyfruit, 1990, 06:00 b/w;\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 2, 49:00 min\nA Place Called Lovely, 1991, 14:00 b/w;\nGirl Power, 1992, 15:00 b/w;\nIt Wasn't Love, 1992, 20:00 b/w;\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 3, 70:00 min\nGerman Song, 1995, 05:00 b/w;\nThe Judy Spots, 1995, 15:00 b/w;\nFlat is Beautiful, 1998, 50:00 b/w;\nFlat is Beautiful, 1998, (included in Video works V.3), 50:00 mins\nBibliography:\nMorris, Garry Behind the Mask: Sadie Benning's Pixel Pleasures, Bright Lights Film Journal, April 1999 Issue 24.\nFilm and Video Umbrella The Fisher-price Pixelvision camera (notes from a touring exhibition)\nOwen, Wendy Net Dezigns - Web Designs, and HTML Document Development, 1997\nHolmlund, Chris & Fuchs, Cynthia Between the Sheets, in the Streets : Queer, Lesbian, and Gay Documentary (Visible Evidence, Vol 1)\nHolmlund, Chris When Autobiography Meets Ethnography and Girl Meets Girl: The \"Dyke Docs\" of Sadie Benning and Su Friedrich Univ of Minnesota, Chapter 7\nChang, Chris Up in Sadie's Room, Film Comment V29, No.2 (March-April, 1993)\nSpiro, Ellen, Shooting Star: Teenage Video Maker Sadie Benning Attracts a Youthful Audience Advocate, No. 573 (March 26, 1991)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:38:50.309048+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6163, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadie_Benning"}], "uuid": "1db14d23-536c-4402-9dfd-574fe20bfe53", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110024", "external_references": [{"id": 26150, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q448193"}, {"id": 55744, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "165546277"}, {"id": 55745, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n2008001992"}, {"id": 55746, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n2008001992"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:38:50.309318+11:00"}, {"id": 6503, "name": "Paul Western-Pittard", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2708606, "title": "Fish!", "work_id": 108019, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2708608, "title": "Fish!", "work_id": 108019, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2708544, "title": "[Walk cycle]", "work_id": 108014, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:03:54.834660+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "7d588065-1a4f-4651-a22e-4ad0929c2e9c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110014", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T22:43:34.132998+11:00"}, {"id": 6502, "name": "Michael Buckley", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2290072, "title": "Two songs by Dougie Young", "work_id": 75729, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2641077, "title": "Hairy tales", "work_id": 110297, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2374066, "title": "The Greatest Art Movement: Transporting Art: the Story of Melbourne's Art Trams", "work_id": 84738, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2290266, "title": "Two songs by Dougie Young.

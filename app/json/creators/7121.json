Haig’s practice refuses to accept that the low and the base level are devoid of value and cultural meaning. His body obsessed themes can be seen throughout a large body of work over the last twenty years. Previous works have looked to the contemporary media sphere and its relationship to the visceral body, the degenerative aspects of pervasive new technologies, to cultural forms of fanaticism and cults, to ideas of attraction and repulsion, body horror, the defamiliarisation and confrontation of the human body.\n\nHis work has been exhibited in galleries and video/media festivals around the world. Including exhibitions at: The Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne; The Ian Potter Museum of Art, Melbourne; The Experimental Art Foundation, Adelaide; The Australian Centre for the Moving Image, Melbourne; Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Artec Biennale – Nagoya, Japan; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; China Millennium Monument Art Museum, Beijing; Museum Villa Rot, Burgrieden-Rot, Germany; The Havana Biennial, Cuba. In addition his video work has screened in over 150 festivals internationally including The Ann Arbor film festival, US and VideoBrasil, Sao Paulo, Brazil. In 2003 he received a fellowship from the New Media Arts Board of the Australia Council and in 2013 and 2017 he curated the video art shows Unco and Very Unco at The Torrance Art Museum in Los Angeles.\n\n[source: https://www.ianhaig.net/index.php?section=bio; last accessed 11.02.21]", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:27:10.821123+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "64cb4e76-7346-4665-b088-4bb1147d6531", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110727", "external_references": [{"id": 39127, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q120308529"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:27:10.821336+11:00"}

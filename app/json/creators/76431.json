With a career spanning five decades, Bergman is often regarded as one of the most influential screen figures in cinematic history. She won numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Award and a Volpi Cup. She is one of only four actresses to have received at least three acting Academy Awards (only Katharine Hepburn has four). In 1999, the American Film Institute recognised Bergman as the fourth greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and a German mother, Bergman began her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to the U.S. audience came in the English-language remake of Intermezzo (1939). Known for her naturally luminous beauty, she starred in Casablanca (1942) as Ilsa Lund. Bergman's notable performances in the 1940s include the dramas For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Joan of Arc (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she won for Gaslight. She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock: Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Under Capricorn (1949).\nIn 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli, released after the revelation that she was having an affair with Rossellini; that and her pregnancy prior to their marriage created a scandal in the U.S. that prompted her to remain in Europe for several years. During this time she starred in Rossellini's Europa '51 and Journey to Italy (1954), the former of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She returned to Hollywood, earning two more Academy Awards for her roles in Anastasia (1956) and Murder on the Orient Express (1974). During this period she also starred in Indiscreet (1958), Cactus Flower (1969), and Autumn Sonata (1978) receiving her sixth Best Actress nomination.\nBergman won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine (1947). She also won two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for The Turn of the Screw (1960), and A Woman Called Golda (1982). In 1974, Bergman discovered she was suffering from breast cancer but continued to work until shortly before her death on her sixty-seventh birthday in 1982. Bergman spoke five languages – Swedish, English, German, Italian and French – and acted in each.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:48:51.468721+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4198, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Bergman"}], "uuid": "0116f3a8-72d7-41c2-80b6-69998fe96449", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31910", "external_references": [{"id": 25057, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q43247"}, {"id": 29024, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "68925401"}, {"id": 29025, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50007485"}, {"id": 29026, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50007485"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:48:53.562510+10:00"}

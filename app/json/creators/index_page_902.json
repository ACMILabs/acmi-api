He had a stint working as an agent for the William Morris Agency, and was taught to speak English by Albert Finney. In 1972 he read an article about the Jesuit order and political trouble in South America in Time magazine which generated a lifelong interest in it and formed the basis of several of the films he produced, including The Mission and the Anglo-Italian series Nostromo. He spent over a decade in Hollywood, returning to his native Italy in the late 1980s and establishing Pixit Productions in Rome. In the 1990s Ghia married actress Gaia De Laurentiis, 35 years his junior; they had a son, Sebastian, in 1996.

His film roles included First Blood (1982), Gorky Park (1983), Silverado (1985), Cocoon (1985), F/X (1986), Presumed Innocent (1990), Romeo + Juliet (1996), Ratatouille (2007), and Knight of Cups (2015).

Brian's final film was Driveways (2020), in which he plays a veteran of the Korean war, living alone, who befriends a young, shy, boy, who has come with his mom to clean out his deceased aunt's hoarded home.\nAccording to Variety, Dennehy was \"perhaps the foremost living interpreter\" of playwright Eugene O'Neill's works on stage and screen. He had a decades long relationship with Chicago's Goodman Theatre where much of his O'Neill work originated. He also regularly played Canada's Stratford Festival, especially in works by William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett.

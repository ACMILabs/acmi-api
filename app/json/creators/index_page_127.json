the score for 2019 horror film, The Vigil: \"Why have there been so many horror films that have explored the various denominations of Christianity and demons and devils and everything associated with Christianity, but there has hardly ever been a film that explores the dark side of Jewish mysticism? I'm Jewish myself, so this is exactly the question that I've been asking. What I love about horror films, and dark, edgy films, in general â€“ there's so much creative license to play with musical effects in non traditional ways. It's really fun as a composer.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:10:58.229003+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4720, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Yezerski"}], "uuid": "4dc29255-502d-41b2-955d-1953767507cd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37048", "external_references": [{"id": 25283, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6835480"}, {"id": 30383, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "311364781"}, {"id": 30384, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr2003025945"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:10:58.239033+10:00"}, {"id": 84184, "name": "Karl Sadler", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2230014, "title": "Process V3", "work_id": 117414, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:34:37.993257+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "776197b0-2151-4245-ada8-e27dde7c03a6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37276", "external_references": [{"id": 37183, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121144283"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:01:09.119322+10:00"}, {"id": 84183, "name": "Chris Saunders", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2230012, "title": "Process V3", "work_id": 117414, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:34:37.646268+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "316c6ffb-847b-41a2-973c-f302cbe1324a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37275", "external_references": [{"id": 37100, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121143956"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:33:04.060785+10:00"}, {"id": 84182, "name": "Juliette Larthe", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2230011, "title": "Process V3", "work_id": 117414, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:34:37.406130+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "932b8c54-8bc3-40c6-acd7-295695bc1010", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37274", "external_references": [{"id": 38845, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121079272"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T21:56:50.032847+10:00"}, {"id": 84181, "name": "Dazed and Confused", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2230007, "title": "Process V3", "work_id": 117414, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:34:36.938710+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "91044ab0-7c86-41ea-a3e5-082fc4285bad", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37273", "external_references": [{"id": 34576, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121126326"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:04:16.202602+10:00"}, {"id": 84180, "name": "John Kassab", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2337991, "title": "Utopia", "work_id": 117421, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2337754, "title": "Federal Department of Odd and Ends", "work_id": 117420, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2337711, "title": "The City", "work_id": 117419, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2338091, "title": "The Lost Thing: character", "work_id": 117415, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2337670, "title": "The Boy", "work_id": 117413, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T19:35:11.434360+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3a075d59-d756-431f-b84d-7f11d956bdcd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37047", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

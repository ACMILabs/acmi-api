He spent his early years (6-17 years), at 17 Eggham Road, West Ham. George started work at 14 in London as a messenger boy taking telegrams around the streets of London.\n\nAt 15 years of age George joined the British merchant navy like his father.\nHe served on his first vessel as a deck boy and sailed to South America.\nAt 17 years of age he sailed to China and Japan and his last vessel was the SS Ascianius. He paid off on 10/12/1928 in Melbourne at 18 years of age.\n\nIn Melbourne, George met Sybil. Sybil was impressed by the Englishman who travelled the world and had such wonderful dreams for the future and seemed so worldly wise compared to the country boys she knew from Warrandyte.\n\nGeorge and Sybil married in Richmond in April 1937, after 5 years of courtship, - but not until after George had worked hard to bring out both his sister and his mother to join him in Australia. In those early years, George worked at Kraft Foods and was encouraged to go to night school to complete his Electrical Contractors A Grade Certificate.\n\nHelen and John were born in 1940 and 1942.  George joined the RAAF 35th Squadron in June 1942.  George was based overseas as an electrical engineer in Moratai, an island off New Guinea. He serviced aircraft when they returned to base.\nGeorge never spoke much about his wartime experiences, however, he never forgot bringing back prisoners of war from Changi prison after peace was declared. George was discharged on 19 December 1945.\n\nRuth and Janet were born after the war and all the family remember the wonderful days in North Balwyn where they grew up. Every summer in those early years, was spent at Wye River with immediate family, cousins Delaneys and other friends, camping and surfing on boards made by George.\n\nGeorge and Sybil travelled throughout their marriage, and for their first big trip in1959 they sold the family home in North Balwyn and heading for England – “home”, as it still was to George. The family sailed on The SS Orontes.\n\nThe family returned to Australia in 1960 after 2 years away.\n\nIt has been said that the best thing a man could do for his children is to love their mother and George never stopped doing that. He gave his family a wonderful start in life. George was optimistic, happy and enthusiastic. He encouraged his family to give everything their best shot and applauded all their achievements. George taught his children that hard work would generally bring good results. George believed that having fun was very important and nothing was too much trouble if everyone had a good time. George lived a full life up until his death at 96 years of age. Watching the family movies he had made was a favourite past time in those latter years.\nSource: Ruth Hargrave (nee Malin) daughter of George.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography":

Sydney, Australia, 1915)\nWilliam senior, his wife Annie and the two older boys emigrated as a family by steamship from England to Australia (Sydney) in 1911.\nIn due course William junior became a plasterer, residing initially in Sydney, before moving to Bulawayo, Rhodesia in the mid to late 1930’s. During World War 2 he served in the Southern Rhodesia Forces for 6 years (1940 to 1946) in a medical corp, travelling to various wartime conflict zones, including Middle East, Egypt and Cyprus. He also spent time in England, perhaps after the war, before returning to Bulawayo in 1950.\nOutside of wartime service he undertook his vocational trade as a plasterer, which financed his extensive travels throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. In the early 1960’s he purchased an 8 mm movie camera and documented his travels using the same, the product of which is the fourteen film reels he left as a legacy of these travels.\nWilliam remained a bachelor his whole life and lived out his later years in Melbourne, where he experienced poor health and died with related complications on the 12th October 1979. He had requested his body be donated to medical science and this was duly undertaken, with his internment by the University of Melbourne in Eltham Cemetery taking place on the 20th November 1981.\n-

Charles worked at Johns & Waygood in City Road, South Melbourne progressing from office boy to the machine shop. In 1942 he was nominated to take charge of the Munitions Annex in Montague making 10lb mortar bombs. He purchased an Austin A40 car in 1949 which he kept until 1973 – the car also makes an appearance or two in the home movies!  The family purchased a property at Miller Road, Heathmont, comprising 5 acres of land in 1950 – they had decided to build some sheds and try being poultry farmers.\n\nOver the years the family had numerous cows, ducks, pigs, sheep, dogs, cats and of course Ticka the cockatoo, all these animals were treated as pets. For socialising and fitness Charles with his wife Elsie, joined the local tennis club and enjoyed playing at the weekend. Charles joined the Ringwood Movie Club through some friends and enjoyed the friendship of the club and continued to record their travels with his trusty home movie camera. In 1966 Charles went on to work for another business in Mitcham, so they eased out of the poultry business.\n\nTheir daughter Olwyn married John Baker on the 9th July 1967 and had two sons. Elenor married Ron Peach on 2nd April 1970 and had two daughters – Elenor kindly donated the films to ACMI. Elise and Charles were happily married more than 50 years - these films remain testament to a happy and hard-working family from Melbourne’s outer eastern suburbs.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2024-04-17T04:05:55.958210+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b9277b38-6046-4045-b6f8-b31abd4b42ad", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38910", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2024-04-17T04:05:55.958454+10:00"}]}

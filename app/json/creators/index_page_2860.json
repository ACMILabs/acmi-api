From his seminal guerrilla television work of the late 1960s and his alternative regional portraits of the 1970s, to his recent public television productions, he brings a distinctive, personal approach to the documentary form that, in his words, \"warms up the cool medium of television.\"\n\nBlumberg's energetic works give voice to the individual and the community, as he discovers the idiosyncratic and extraordinary in America's regions and subcultures, foregrounding games, sports, music, dance and performance as celebrations of cultural expression. Works such as Pick Up Your Feet: The Double Dutch Show (1981) are recognized classics of the genre. His more recent tapes are finely-crafted collaborations with performance artists.\n\nIn 1969, Blumberg was a co-founder of one of the earliest video collectives, the countercultural Videofreex, which established Lanesville TV as an artists' low-power television station in New York State. He was also a central participant in the pioneering guerrilla television group TVTV, where, applying the portability of small-format video equipment to the alternative media coverage of political events, he developed his characteristic personal interview style and informal, video verite techniques. In 1984 Blumberg was selected for Esquire magazine's register of \"The Best of the New Generation.\"\n\n\nRecognition: Blumberg has been artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York, and the 1980 Winter Olympics, and produced and directed many programs for the 'Alive From Off Center' series of KTCA TV, Minneapolis. He has received funding from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, among others. Blumberg's tapes have been broadcast on public and network television, and have been exhibited widely at institutions and festivals.\nExhibitions : The Museum of Modern Art, New York\nWalker Art Center, Minneapolis\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York\nMuseum of Broadcasting, New York\nInternational Center of Photography, New York\nCentre Georges Pompidou, Paris\nBerlin Film Festival\nAmerican Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles\nDanish Video Festival, Copenhagen\nThe Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:39:55.345134+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "97564ed1-269f-4cc5-8cd5-4cda94325007", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110025", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:39:55.345342+11:00"}, {"id": 6292, "name": "Bureau of Inverse Technology (B.I.T.)", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2637286, "title": "BIT Plane", "work_id": 114033, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2747889, "title": "Suicide box", "work_id": 107907, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1991", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "B.I.T. is a real organization formed in 1992 existing in geographic dislocation (Melbourne, San Francisco and Berlin) which is engaged in the ongoing distance-operation of B.I.T. experimentation and other technological diversions.

Barr's understated narratives, which include minimalist fiction, wry anecdotes, and nonlinear performance documents, relay their stories through precise, lucid imagery and a spare use of language. In recent years he has translated these formal and narrative strategies into works that take the form of video projection installations.\n\nBarr's enigmatic tales of anonymous men and women caught by circumstance and unable to act with conviction -- the voyeuristic neighbor in The Woman Next Door (1984), the doomed vacationer of The Dogs (1989) -- depict confined inner lives and the isolation of urban America. With deadpan humor and wry detachment, he constructs heightened narrative tension and subtle psychological drama by employing strict formal structures and a rigorous economy of visual and verbal means.\n\nBarr's performance works, including Trisha and Carmen (1988) and Aeros (1990), blur the line between fiction and document. Transforming conventional documentary technique, Barr eschews plot-driven stories, allowing a narrative line to emerge from his subject, rather than imposing one. A short story writer who began working in video in 1984, Barr creates elliptical narratives that distill the irresolution and complex internal nuances of everyday life.\n\nBarr was born in 1938. He received a B.A. from Boston University and an M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. He has received numerous grants and awards from the New York and Massachusetts State Councils on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Contemporary Art Television (CAT) Fund. In 1998 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. His tapes have been broadcast on public television and exhibited internationally, at festivals and institutions including the Biennial Exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the San Sebastian Film and Video Festival, Spain; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Berlin Film Festival; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Festival du Nouveau Cinema et de la Video, Montreal; and the International Center of Photography, New York.

Rendered with wit and ingenuity, Baldino's ironic performance tapes question the function and meaning of everyday objects and actions.\n\nLow-tech and straightforward, her works often document the artist in the process of assembling found objects, taking them apart, reconstructing them, or transforming their function. These minimalist vignettes, shot with a static camera and often performed in real time, exhibit an anecdotal conceptual humor and an implied, though elusive, narrativity. Typically, Baldino's actions result in oppositions, contradictions or incongruities; she reveals ironic gaps between her deconstructed objects and the meanings or functions assigned to them.\n\nBaldino's pieces are often seeded with wry references to gender and role-playing, which takes the form of ironic costuming and performance. Her witty inquiries into the meaning and perception of objects and gestures are often informed by scientific or philosophical principles. Baldino's video works are most often incorporated within an expanded context of installation, objects, or projections.\n\nPhyllis Baldino was born in 1956. She earned a B.F.A. from Hartford Art School, Connecticut. She has had one-person shows at Tate, Thomas Nordenstad Gallery and Lauren Wittels, New York; and Southern Exposure Gallery, San Francisco. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Impakt Festival, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; The Guggenheim Museum Soho, New York; Air de Paris, Nice; Four Walls, New York; Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies; and Independent Art Space, London.

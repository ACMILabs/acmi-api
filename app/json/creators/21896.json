The producer of the song, Mike Thorne, disputed this and stated that the lyrics originally had Mann singing to another woman, though the sex was changed owing to pressure from the record label.Hausman later became a talent manager, representing Mann and other artists, including Michael Penn, Skeleton Key and Pete Droge. In addition to Mann, his current roster includes Suzanne Vega, Marc Cohn, Amanda Palmer, Kristina Train, The Both, and Christina Courtin. Hausman, along with Mann and Penn, founded the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:14:12.568236+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4691, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hausman"}], "uuid": "f17e17db-5e0a-464c-b718-6350eb8dbb86", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25091", "external_references": [{"id": 25922, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6831005"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T16:14:12.590296+10:00"}

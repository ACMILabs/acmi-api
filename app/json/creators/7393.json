Jones graduated from CalArts School of Film in 1990.\nIn 1999 he received a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship. He currently combines teaching with his filmmaking practice in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I make essay films addressed not to passive consumers, but to citizens (ideally, all spectators) who think as well as feel when they attend the movies. \"\n\nFilmography\n\nFluff, 4 mins, b/w video\n\nFluff is at once a tribute to abstract video art and an affectionate send-up of the promotional language of 1970's gay porno flicks. The narrator speaks more and more quickly until the piece becomes a frenzy of overwrought prose and bracing disco music.\n\n\nMassillon\n(16mm, color, 70 minutes, 1991)\n\nThe filmmaker of Massillon knows \"you can't go home again,\" and yet he does. He photographs beautiful scenery and makes political commentary; he recounts childhood betrayals and discusses the etymology of the word \"sodomy\" - all this and more in an unconventional debut.\n\nFinished\n(16mm, color, 75 minutes, 1997)\n\nFinished is a detective story and a love story, a film noir bathed in sunlight. It's a film of contradictions: pornographic yet chaste, distanced yet mesmerizing, reticent yet moving. It reminds us that life in the movies is not like life at the movies. - Filmforum program notes\n\n'Finished' premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. It has also been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival, at Portland's Northwest Film Center, and at Filmforum and the American Cinematheque in Los Angeles.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T23:02:04.113226+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "fb4d62a9-c874-452b-b443-7e7396bda788", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110945", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T23:02:04.113437+11:00"}

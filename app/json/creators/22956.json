He studied at the University of Television and Film Munich, Germany. In 1964 he directed the short film Anmeldung (Declaration) which was awarded a Silver Bear at the Berlin Filmfest. During the 1960s, Rob Houwer became one of the most prolific producers in Germany, with directors Volker Schlöndorff (A Degree of Murder, Man on Horseback), Peter Fleischmann (Hunting Scenes from Bavaria), Johannes Schaaf (Tattoo), Michael Verhoeven (Up the Establishment, o.k.) and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg (Romy: Anatomy of a Face). Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1971, he frequently collaborated with Paul Verhoeven and produced most of his Dutch films. Turkish Delight (1973), based on the novel by Jan Wolkers, became the most frequently visited film in Dutch cinema and still holds that place today.  The relationship between Houwer and Verhoeven ended when Verhoeven moved to the US in 1985. Houwer's later films did not always enjoy the huge commercial success of his early productions. The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?), supervised by Houwer and artist Marten Toonder became the All-Time Number One Dutch animated feature at the box office. Some of his later productions were considered to be among the worst in Dutch cinema by critics: De gulle Minnaar (1990), De Zeemeerman (1996) and Het woeden der gehele wereld (2006). He was appointed the Order of Orange-Nassau.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:51:25.317407+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2954, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Houwer"}], "uuid": "3c481e07-a753-4a9a-8812-dd582b4e3ec0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27595", "external_references": [{"id": 12551, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q945766"}, {"id": 12552, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "87053112"}, {"id": 12553, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2003044302"}, {"id": 12554, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2003044302"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:14.356425+10:00"}

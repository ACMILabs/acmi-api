Hirst has a strong interest in Romanticism and regularly mines the grandiosity and overly poetic narratives of this tradition to reveal the absurd or alarming realities that lurk beneath them. Engaging with wildly different subjects and contexts, her work explores what our representations of, and relationships to, the natural world reveal about specific cultural and political values, stuctures and histories.\n\nHirst completed an MFA in Fine Art Media at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, having previously studied at the National Art School, Sydney, IUAV, Venice, and the College of Fine Arts, Sydney. She has received numerous grants and prizes, including an Arts Council England Project Grant (2019); Prototype Moving Image Commission (2019); A-N Development Grant (2019); John Crampton Postgraduate Award (2016); Martin Bequest Travelling Scholarship (2013); and was shortlisted for the Ivan Juriitz Prize at Kings College (2018). She is currently a fellow at the Bomb Factory Studio Foundation, North London and has undertaken residencies at The Cite Internationale des Arts, Paris; Metal Culture, Southend-on-Sea; Cove Park, Scotland; and the ZKU, Berlin. Hirst has exhibited widely, including at the Goethe Institute, London (2019), South London Botanical Institute (2019); Block 336, London (2018); BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Newcastle (2018); The Courtauld, Somerset House, London (2018); Carriageworks, Sydney (2018); and the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne (2016).", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2024-12-11T03:36:09.129041+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9492d35d-fe8c-48c8-ace6-cade73ead211", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39347", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2024-12-11T03:36:09.129266+11:00"}

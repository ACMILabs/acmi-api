Hatoum was born in Lebanon and attended Beirut University College. Her graduate education in London was followed by artist-in-residencies at Western Front in Vancouver and broad international exhibitions, including major solo shows at Centre Pompidou in Paris and Arnolfini in Bristol.\n\nMona Hatoum was born into a Palestinian family in Beirut in 1952 and since 1975 has lived and worked in London. She originally came to England on a visit and stayed on when the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon prevented her from returning.\n\nAfter studying at the Byam Shaw and the Slade School of Art, Hatoum first became widely known in the mid 80s for a series of performance and video work that focused with a great intensity on the body. Since the beginning of the 90s her work moved increasingly towards large-scale installation works that aim to engage the viewer in conflicting emotions of desire and revulsion, fear and fascination. Hatoum has developed a language in which familiar, domestic, every day objects like chairs, beds, cots and kitchen utensils are made to appear threatening and strange. Even the human body is rendered unfamiliar in Corps Etranger (1994), a video installation that displays an endoscopic journey through the interior landscape of her own body.\n\nHatoum's work has been exhibited widely in Europe, the United States and Canada. In 1997 a major survey of her work was organised by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and toured to the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh (1998). Other solo exhibitions include Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris in 1994 and Castello di Rivoli, Turin in 1999. Hatoum's exhibition 'The Entire World as a Foreign Land' was the inaugural exhibition for the launch of Tate Britain, London in 2000.\n\nSolo exhibitions (since 1989)\n1989 The Light at the End, The Showroom, London\nThe Light at the End, Oboro Gallery, Montreal\n1992 Mona Hatoum, Mario Flecha Gallery, London\nDissected Space, Chapter, Cardiff\n1993 Recent Work, Arnolfini, Bristol\nLe Socle du Monde, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris\n1994 Mona Hatoum, Galerie Rene Blouin, Montreal\nMona Hatoum, Musee national d'art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris\nMona Hatoum, C.R.G.

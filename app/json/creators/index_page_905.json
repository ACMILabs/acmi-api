Early in his career, he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine Oxford Poetry, before going on to publish travel writing, satire, and screenplays. He spent the latter part of his life in the United States, living in Los Angeles from 1937 until his death. By the end of his life, Huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature nine times, and was elected Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature in 1962.Huxley was a pacifist. He grew interested in philosophical mysticism, as well as universalism, addressing these subjects in his works such as The Perennial Philosophy, which illustrates commonalities between Western and Eastern mysticism, and The Doors of Perception, which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline. In his most famous novel Brave New World and his final novel Island, he presented his visions of dystopia and utopia, respectively.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T13:57:27.469695+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3515, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"}], "uuid": "1ad4296e-6270-4c29-9504-7d489ff28977", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "272", "external_references": [{"id": 25088, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q81447"}, {"id": 27160, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "71392434"}, {"id": 27161, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n80057246"}, {"id": 27162, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n80057246"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:23:59.659002+10:00"}, {"id": 76475, "name": "Robert Z Leonard", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2212211, "title": "Duchess of Idaho", "work_id": 95618, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228964, "title": "Pride and prejudice", "work_id": 79529, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2649394, "title": "Maytime", "work_id": 81463, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1978849, "title": "Nancy goes to Rio", "work_id": 95566, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228983, "title": "Pride and prejudice (S) (Captioned)", "work_id": 85193, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 786354, "title": "Girl of the Golden West", "work_id": 84596, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Robert Zigler Leonard", "date_of_birth": "07 OCT 1889", "date_of_death": "27 AUG 1968", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Robert Zigler Leonard (October 7, 1889 – August 27, 1968) was an American film director, actor, producer, and screenwriter.

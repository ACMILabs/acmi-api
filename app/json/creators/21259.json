In 1970, he was a founder of the Yellow House Artist Collective in Sydney.  After the Yellow House finished, he established himself in Bundeena and since then has produced a large and varied output of drawings, paintings, films, and writings.  Gittoes’ work has consistently expressed his social, political and humanitarian concern at the effects of injustice and conflict.  Until the mid-1980s, this work was chiefly done in Australia.  But in 1986 he travelled to Nicaragua, and since then the focus of Gittoes’ work has been largely international.  He has travelled to and worked in many regions of conflict, including the Philippines, Somalia, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, Bougainville, and South Africa.  In recent years his work has especially centred on the Middle East, with repeated visits to Israel and Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan.  In 2011, he established a new Yellow House, a multidisciplinary arts centre in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.  Among many prizes, Gittoes has twice been awarded the Blake Prize for Religious Art.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:58:16.392973+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4044, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gittoes"}], "uuid": "1cd68e09-285a-4583-be6a-e7c26fdd8cd7", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "19601", "external_references": [{"id": 26531, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5539735"}, {"id": 28604, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "35328212"}, {"id": 28605, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n99255318"}, {"id": 28606, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n99255318"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T19:58:18.543026+11:00"}

Rhall’s cultural background consists of Taungurung and colonial heritages – a state endemic to living in a colonised society – but goes by Taungurung when asked. His alter-ego Blak Metal is less defined and uses they/them pronouns.\n\nRhall’s art practice finds expression in ideas of institutional critique, interrogating modes of representation, classification and hierarchy both within and external to the art world(s). He works across various forms and interventions, including installation, performance, process led methodologies, curatorial projects, sculpture and art within the public realm. Many of his projects propose, explore and critique the exchange of economic and cultural capital found in the matrix of relations and intersections of First Nation art production, presentation and encounter.\n\nRhall recently concluded a five year tenure as lecturer for the Master of Contemporary Art programme at the Victorian College of the Arts and now, alongside his art practice, supports First Nations participants in the Statewide Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community Program. Rhall is also represented by MARS Gallery on Birrarung-ga land (Melbourne, Australia).", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T07:06:05.744260+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "706257c1-8f4c-4542-a547-ce3858f4f2b9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40387", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T07:06:05.744507+11:00"}

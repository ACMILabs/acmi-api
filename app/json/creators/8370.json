She was an actor in theatre in her teens and early twenties, becoming involved in film-making in 1984. Over the next decade she played a significant role in the development of the underground and experimental film communities in Melbourne.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, she moved from experimental into narrative film-making. Her films into the 2000s were exhibited extensively and internationally, including at major festivals such as Rotterdam, Sydney and Melbourne, along with more specialised or smaller festivals and events in many countries. Her films 'Pale Black' (1992), 'Maidenhead' (1995) and 'Blow' (2002) gathered several awards at international film festivals.\n\nFrom 2007-2015 she was prolifically involved in providing vocals to electronic music producers around the world, collaborating via the internet under the artist name, 'Pixieguts', and in a duo with Paul Foster called 'Cwtch'.\n\nShe returned her primary focus to film-making in 2014, specialising in poetry film. Between 2014 and 2019 she released more than 60 short films in this genre, which have screened widely and internationally at specialised festivals and events, and gathered a number of awards.\n\nIn other roles, she has freelanced as a teacher of screen-writing at universities, technical colleges and community centres, a reviewer of films and books, an arts administrator, and a curator of film exhibitions, most notably the Australian National Focus at the Festival de Cine Experimental de Madrid in 1994.

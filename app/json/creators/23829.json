He first gained attention for film noir mysteries such as Laura (1944) and Fallen Angel (1945), while in the 1950s and 1960s, he directed high-profile adaptations of popular novels and stage works. Several of these later films pushed the boundaries of censorship by dealing with themes which were then taboo in Hollywood, such as drug addiction (The Man with the Golden Arm, 1955), rape (Anatomy of a Murder, 1959) and homosexuality (Advise & Consent, 1962). He was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. He also had several acting roles.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:37:42.910513+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2807, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Preminger"}], "uuid": "e540607f-0c3f-48a6-bca4-65ace3bb7be9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25990", "external_references": [{"id": 11965, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q52997"}, {"id": 11966, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "29539444"}, {"id": 11967, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50022887"}, {"id": 11968, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50022887"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:20:39.503315+11:00"}

However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences soon found out the film had been shown first in October 1967, thus making it ineligible for a 1968 award and the Oscar was revoked. (This marks the only time, as of 2021, where an Academy Award was first awarded and then revoked.) Grasshoff, who reportedly slept with the Oscar on the first night, also directed Academy Award-nominated films The Really Big Family (1966) and Journey to the Outer Limits (1973). He also directed the award-winning The Wave (1981), based on Ron Jones' The Third Wave experiment, and Future Shock (1972), based on Alvin Toffler's book and hosted by Orson Welles.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:44:23.941654+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1593, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grasshoff"}], "uuid": "d402f864-298f-4c50-928f-ca52c9831753", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14889", "external_references": [{"id": 6968, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q379191"}, {"id": 6969, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "92033039"}, {"id": 6970, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr98006206"}, {"id": 6971, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr98006206"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T01:11:22.385993+11:00"}

His 1969 Western epic The Wild Bunch received an Academy Award nomination and was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute's top 100 list. His films employed a visually innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence as well as a revisionist approach to the Western genre.\nPeckinpah's films deal with the conflict between values and ideals, as well as the corruption and violence in human society. His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality. He was given the nickname \"Bloody Sam\" owing to the violence in his films.\nPeckinpah's combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, affected his professional legacy. The production of many of his films included battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime. Peckinpah's other films include Major Dundee (1965), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), Straw Dogs (1971), The Getaway (1972), Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), Cross of Iron (1977), and Convoy (1978), the most commercially successful film of his career.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:00:38.429896+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3055, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah"}], "uuid": "2420452d-b6f5-41d2-a7d5-71d9ed3016da", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28487", "external_references": [{"id": 12963, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q51461"}, {"id": 12964, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "73992148"}, {"id": 12965, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79026876"}, {"id": 12966, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79026876"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:33.672308+10:00"}

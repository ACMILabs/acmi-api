The group's stated mission is to develop technologies that extend the autonomy of human activists in the performance of real-world, public acts of expression.  The diminishing accessibility of public spaces for free expression and the increased omnipresence of electronic surveillance has been a key motivation for IAA research.\nThe IAA has exhibited at such diverse venues as the ZKM, Karlsruhe; the OK Centrum for Gegenwartskkunst, Linz; and the IEEE International Conference of Robotics and Automation.  Its most recent project TXTmob was widely used as an organisational tool by activists at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.\n\nTaken from the PROOF exhibition 2004 (SW)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-26T16:55:02.162069+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "cefe0cd3-d55b-4073-83d0-49d356c4bf2c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2420", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T16:55:02.162371+11:00"}

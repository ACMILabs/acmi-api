Working in the San Francisco Bay Area, his political, site-specific performance actions explored ritual and symbolic content in the objects, places, and natural phenomena of everyday life.\n\nFox's work in video is an extension of these concerns. His 1974 Children's Tapes is a classic early investigation of the medium. With wit and ingenuity, Fox used the intimate scale and time-based properties of video to translate the aesthetic and formal tenets of minimalism, real time, perception and performance into the realm of the everyday. These engaging phenomenological dramas, which illustrate basic principles of physical science with household objects, unfold as anecdotal narratives of the quotidian.\n\nLiving and working in Europe for the past several years, Fox has continued to produce multi-media installations, performances and sculptures.\n\nTerry Fox was born in 1943. He studied at the Cornish School of Allied Arts in Seattle and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Rome. His performances and works have been seen throughout the United States and Europe, at festivals and institutions including the Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse; Documentas 5 and 6, Kassel, Germany; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; De Appel, Amsterdam; Modern Art Gallery, Vienna; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Museum Folkwang, Essen, West Germany; Musee d'Art Moderne, Paris; Het Apollohuis, Eindhoven, Holland; and Gallerie L'A, Liege, Belgium. Fox lives in Liege.\n\nReferences:\nChildren's Tapes, 1974, 30 min, b&w, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-26T22:37:01.834261+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9bac2201-0f83-412e-a29b-86984ce88447", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110037", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T22:37:01.834560+11:00"}

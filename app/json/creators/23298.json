The licence relates to a \"dual region\", meaning that the franchise area was divided into two sub-regions, Wales and the West of England, each of which had to be served by distinct and separate ITV programme services, as more fully defined within the licence.\nFrom January 2014, the dual-region licence was split in two, with ITV Cymru Wales for Wales and ITV West Country covering both the West of England sub-region and South West England. Both licences remain held by ITV plc through its subsidiary ITV Broadcasting Ltd, and the legal names of the former HTV companies have not yet been changed again, although the former holding company was however dissolved on 7 February 2023.The National Library of Wales archives now store 200,000 ITV (HTV) film and video items dating from 1958.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:42:46.606195+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5875, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_Wales_%26_West"}], "uuid": "626a916c-976b-4843-a3cc-7cd34fdb2772", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "9171", "external_references": [{"id": 39696, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3396232"}, {"id": 54689, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "134815509"}, {"id": 54690, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "viaf-134815509"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T00:30:32.497675+11:00"}

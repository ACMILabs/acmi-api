He has been widely considered by many film critics, historians, and directors to be one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time.When Buñuel died at age 83, his obituary in The New York Times called him \"an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later\". His first picture, Un Chien Andalou—made in the silent era—is still viewed regularly throughout the world and retains its power to shock the viewer, and his last film, That Obscure Object of Desire—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work \"the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive\".Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. Having worked in Europe and North America, and in French and Spanish, Buñuel also directed films spanning various genres. Despite this variety, filmmaker John Huston believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable, or, as Ingmar Bergman put it, \"Buñuel nearly always made Buñuel films\".Seven of Buñuel's films are included in Sight & Sound's 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, second only to Jean-Luc Godard, with sixteen, and he ranks number 13 on their list of the top 250 directors.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:19:17+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2607, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel"}], "uuid": "cdc46797-7132-44f2-ad64-1254b39c8c07", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "333", "external_references": [{"id": 11143, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q51545"}, {"id": 11144, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "68926369"}, {"id": 11145, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79004176"}, {"id": 11146, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79004176"}], "date_modified": "2024-10-18T22:51:13.115229+11:00"}

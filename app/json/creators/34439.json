This film was different from other films of that period in that it presents certain emotions and sympathies towards the relationship between Mainland China and Hong Kong (the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed the same year Homecoming was released).\nThe film brings together two very well known actresses, Josephine Koo and Siqin Gaowa. Anita Mui's theme song with the same title as the film has also been a popular cantopop song.\nHo's son Linq Yim (Chinese:严艺之, otherwise known as 嚴羚) is an actor, musician, and director who acted in Ho's 2005 film A West Lake Moment, and  composed its original soundtrack.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:25:01.260956+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3314, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yim_Ho"}], "uuid": "c1ad7d34-33e4-4fa8-ba7f-819a4386484e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30587", "external_references": [{"id": 14017, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6141069"}, {"id": 14018, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117289629"}, {"id": 14019, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2007070137"}, {"id": 14020, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2007070137"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:33:21.111255+10:00"}

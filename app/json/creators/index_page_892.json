From his start as a music prodigy, he came to be regarded as a respected figure in the history of film music. He won nine Academy Awards and was nominated 45 times, contributing to the extended Newman family being the most Academy Award-nominated family, with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.\nIn a career spanning more than four decades, Newman composed the scores for over 200 motion pictures. Some of his most famous scores include Wuthering Heights, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Mark of Zorro, How Green Was My Valley, The Song of Bernadette, Captain from Castile, All About Eve, Love is a Many Splendored Thing, Anastasia, The Diary of Anne Frank, How The West Was Won, The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his final score, Airport, all of which were nominated for or won Academy Awards. He is perhaps best known for composing the fanfare which accompanies the studio logo at the beginning of 20th Century Fox's productions. Prior to commencing his employment with 20th Century Fox, Newman composed the fanfares which are most often associated with Samuel Goldwyn productions and David O. Selznick productions.\nNewman was also highly regarded as a conductor, and arranged and conducted many scores by other composers, including George Gershwin, Charlie Chaplin, and Irving Berlin. He also conducted the music for many film adaptations of Broadway musicals (having worked on Broadway for ten years before coming to Hollywood), as well as many original Hollywood musicals.\nHe was among the first musicians to compose and conduct original music during Hollywood's Golden Age of movies, later becoming a respected and powerful music director in the history of Hollywood. Newman and two of his fellow composers, Max Steiner and Dimitri Tiomkin, were considered the \"three godfathers of film music\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:28:09.154763+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3526, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Newman"}, {"id": 1608, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Newman_(composer)"}], "uuid": "4b349fbc-4b84-4bd9-bb69-9bf0b5f81d00", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14958", "external_references": [{"id": 7035, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q367032"}, {"id": 7036, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "74038460"}, {"id": 7037, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85376784"}, {"id": 7038, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85376784"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:28:11.209564+10:00"}, {"id": 76602, "name": "Robin de Crespigny", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 771493, "title": "This time, next time", "work_id": 80108, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "61262ece-3862-4f47-be06-0c5e88624a2f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 51509, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121360557"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T00:49:15.363166+10:00"}, {"id": 76601, "name": "Ches Yetman", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 912833, "title": "Ikwe", "work_id": 92928, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2648822, "title": "The Cat came back", "work_id": 80100, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T19:32:11.397415+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "967eebfd-7328-47f4-8f5e-0b92534fddff", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16780", "external_references": [{"id": 35404, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121337049"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:51:26.735500+11:00"}, {"id": 76600, "name": "Peter Sutton", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 771461, "title": "Kay Cottee -

His last writings about film were for Truthdig.\nHe was interviewed in For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism (2009). In this documentary film, he discusses early film critics Frank E. Woods, Robert E. Sherwood, and Otis Ferguson, and tells of how, in the 1960s, he, Pauline Kael, and Andrew Sarris, rejected moralizing opposition of the older Bosley Crowther of The New York Times who had railed against violent movies such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967). In addition to film, Schickel also critiqued and documented cartoons, particularly Peanuts.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T00:33:04.982336+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6131, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel"}], "uuid": "44c65164-8855-41fa-8860-e3da131e44e0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "119", "external_references": [{"id": 36836, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1454098"}, {"id": 55635, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "85917837"}, {"id": 55636, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50016081"}, {"id": 55637, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50016081"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-14T19:08:45.036123+11:00"}, {"id": 76595, "name": "Greg Stump", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2332934, "title": "The Blizzard of Aahhh's", "work_id": 80054, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T19:28:14.665432+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "d76d9fa5-d841-4fa1-92e3-32caab1301af", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20068", "external_references": [{"id": 51984, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121361141"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:22:10.234840+10:00"}, {"id": 76594, "name": "Pauline Thomas", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 899404, "title": "Garden Australia", "work_id": 80051, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "5beb8f4c-2f1a-4a90-94d1-426342a5a464", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 42082, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121159859"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:50:46.490463+10:00"}]}

He was born in Norbiton, Surrey, lived in Sweden, Canada and Lithuania for many years, and now lives in France. He is one of the pioneers of docudrama. His films present pacifist and radical ideas in a nontraditional style. He mainly concentrates his works and ideas around the mass media and our relation/participation to a movie or television documentary.\nNearly all of Watkins' films have used a combination of dramatic and documentary elements to dissect historical occurrences or possible near future events. The first of these, Culloden, portrayed the Jacobite uprising of 1745 in a documentary style, as if television reporters were interviewing the participants and accompanying them into battle; a similar device was used in his biographical film Edvard Munch. La Commune reenacts the Paris Commune days using a large cast of French non-actors.\nIn 2004, he wrote the book Media Crisis, which discusses his ideas of media hegemony which he calls, the monoform, and the lack of debate around the construction of new forms of audiovisual media.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:36:07.338690+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4900, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Watkins"}], "uuid": "e017c19c-9014-476c-a32c-49d8991eeff7", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1543", "external_references": [{"id": 26300, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1339491"}, {"id": 30843, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "79174199"}, {"id": 30844, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86001555"}, {"id": 30845, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86001555"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:58.152184+10:00"}

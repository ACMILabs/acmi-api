Her pioneering work was central to the development of the widely influential French New Wave film movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Her films focused on achieving documentary realism, addressing women's issues, and other social commentary, with a distinctive experimental style.Varda's work employed location shooting in an era when the limitations of sound technology made it easier and more common to film indoors, with constructed sets and painted backdrops of landscapes, rather than outdoors, on location. Her use of non-professional actors was also unconventional for 1950s French cinema. Varda's feature film debut was La Pointe Courte (1955), followed by Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962), one of her most notable film narrative films, Vagabond (1985), and Kung Fu Master (1988). Varda was also known for her work as a documentarian with such works as Black Panthers (1968), The Gleaners and I (2000), The Beaches of Agnès (2008), Faces Places (2017), and her final film, Varda by Agnès (2019).\nDirector Martin Scorsese described Varda as \"one of the Gods of Cinema\". Among several other accolades, Varda received an Honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, an Academy Honorary Award, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. She was the first female director to be feted with an honorary Oscar.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:41:05.977981+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1559, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agn%C3%A8s_Varda"}], "uuid": "a730460f-2c77-4f9a-96c2-f720bbf58bcb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14679", "external_references": [{"id": 6834, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q229990"}, {"id": 6835, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84256688"}, {"id": 6836, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n90695440"}, {"id": 6837, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n90695440"}], "date_modified": "2024-10-18T22:40:23.951561+11:00"}

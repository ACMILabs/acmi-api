As a producer and director, he extracted elements from the CD Rom and transformed Multiple Xposure into a multimedia dance performance titled LUCID. It was performed to a full house at Revolver Upstairs for Melbourne Fringe Festival. LUCID deals with the issues in religious beliefs, homosexuality, violence and psychology. Again he worked with composer Brett Aplin who composed the soundscape to Multiple Xposure.

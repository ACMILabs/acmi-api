He began at Paramount Pictures in the 1920s and eventually worked at virtually every major studio as either a contract producer or an independent. He also served as President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1939 to October 1941 and from December 1941 to 1945. Strongly influenced by European films, Wanger developed a reputation as an intellectual and a socially conscious movie executive who produced provocative message movies and glittering romantic melodramas. He achieved notoriety when, in 1951, he shot and wounded the agent of his then-wife, Joan Bennett, because he suspected they were having an affair. He was convicted of the crime and served a four-month sentence, then returned to making movies.\r\n\r\nAfter his death, his production company, Walter Wanger Productions, was sold to and absorbed by Time-Life Films, which also acquired many films produced by him and that company.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:21:04+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3276, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Wanger"}], "uuid": "86972f10-61cf-4e10-8572-39cfbb665239", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30265", "external_references": [{"id": 13860, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1351511"}, {"id": 13861, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "15575719"}, {"id": 13862, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85199162"}, {"id": 13863, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85199162"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T15:15:00.032950+10:00"}

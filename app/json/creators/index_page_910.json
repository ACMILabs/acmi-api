He was known for his Mid-Atlantic accent, debonair demeanor, light-hearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing. He was one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He was nominated twice for the Academy Award, and was honored with Academy Honorary Award in 1970, and the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981. He was named by American Film Institute the second greatest male star of the Golden Age of Hollywood in 1999.Grant was born and brought up in Bristol, England. He became attracted to theater at a young age when he visited the Bristol Hippodrome. At 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. After a series of successful performances in New York City, he decided to stay there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s.\nGrant initially appeared in crime films and dramas such as Blonde Venus (1932) and She Done Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown for his performances in romantic screwball comedies such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), and The Philadelphia Story (1940). These pictures are frequently cited among the greatest comedy films of all time. Other well-known films in which he starred in this period were the adventure Gunga Din (1939), the dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and the dramas Only Angels Have Wings (1939), Penny Serenade (1941), and None but the Lonely Heart (1944); he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for the latter two.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Grant had a close working relationship with director Alfred Hitchcock, who cast him in four films: Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), To Catch a Thief (1955), and North by Northwest (1959). For the suspense-dramas Suspicion and Notorious, Grant took on darker, morally ambiguous characters, both challenging Grant's screen persona and his acting abilities. Toward the end of his career he starred in the romantic films Indiscreet (1958), That Touch of Mink (1962), and Charade (1963). He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, and able to maintain his dignity in comedies, not sacrificing it entirely.\nGrant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses Virginia Cherrill (1934–1935), Betsy Drake (1949–1962), and Dyan Cannon (1965–1968). He had daughter Jennifer Grant with Cannon. He retired from film acting in 1966 and pursued numerous business interests, representing cosmetics firm Fabergé and sitting on the board of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  He died of a stroke in 1986 at the age of 82.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:21:45.485850+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3721, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant"}], "uuid": "db41e6f4-4ce8-4da6-a42b-edeeb2b5911f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33702", "external_references": [{"id": 25096, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q83410"}, {"id": 27713, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117414035"}, {"id": 27714, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50031212"}, {"id": 27715, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50031212"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:21:47.648752+10:00"}, {"id": 76429, "name": "David Stacey", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898888, "title": "Freefall", "work_id": 79328, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "b44b82b7-976d-4a16-8c12-df08ee17d97b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 43219, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121126042"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:02:51.385041+10:00"}, {"id": 76428, "name": "Cathy Palmer", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898886, "title": "Jessye Norman: Singer", "work_id": 79327, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "4d1112af-29ef-4bcb-9432-9189ed53f895", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 35710, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121223171"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:22:58.599298+10:00"}, {"id": 76427, "name": "Kuumba Productions", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898880, "title": "The Mark of the Hand : Aubrey Williams", "work_id": 79325, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "e95159eb-3538-4ba6-bf78-fa96fcbdbedd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 33245, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121143967"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:12:45.725901+10:00"}, {"id": 76426, "name": "I.

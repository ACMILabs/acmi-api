Metzger and by the pseudonyms, \"Jake Barnes\", \"Erich Farina\" and \"Henry Paris\") (January 21, 1929 – March 31, 2017) was an American pioneering filmmaker and film distributor, most noted for popular artistic, adult-oriented films, including Thérèse and Isabelle (1968), Camille 2000 (1969), The Lickerish Quartet (1970), Score (1974), The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann (1974), The Image (1975), The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976) and Barbara Broadcast (1977). According to one film reviewer, Metzger's films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), are noted for their \"lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle\". Another reviewer noted that his films were \"highly artistic — and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography\". Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:46:17.921864+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2899, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radley_Metzger"}], "uuid": "67ff3242-f6ec-4fdc-8729-bd9403e8d451", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27057", "external_references": [{"id": 12328, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q343888"}, {"id": 12329, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "11928886"}, {"id": 12330, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no98107762"}, {"id": 12331, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no98107762"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:05.607634+10:00"}

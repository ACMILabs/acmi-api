Born in England, he spent much of his childhood in Australia, where he was a child actor of film, television and radio. Returning to England at the age of fourteen, he attended the Harrow County Grammar School for Boys and completed his education at Oxford University.\nHe continued working as a professional actor until 1979, when he joined the National Film and Television School as a directing student. So well-received was his graduation film, The Devotee that producer David Puttnam immediately commissioned him to write and direct a feature-length film for the Channel Four First Love series in the 1980s. From there, he went on to direct The Frog Prince (French Lessons US title), a French-English co-production.\nSubsequently, he has worked in both Hollywood and the UK, directing Vice Versa in 1988, and in 1991 - Not Without My Daughter, the adaptation of the controversial best-seller of the same name, which starred Sally Field as Betty Mahmoody.\nFour years later came Tom & Viv starring Willem Dafoe and Miranda Richardson, the story of poet T. S. Eliot's first marriage, nominated for two Academy Awards. This was eventually followed by the 1997 production Wilde, starring Jude Law and Stephen Fry, based on the Richard Ellmann biography of Oscar Wilde. In 2003, he directed The Gathering, starring Christina Ricci.\nHe wrote and directed the documentary Lord Haw-Haw: Portrait of a Fanatic for UK and Irish television, and in 2006, directed the stage version of Mary Kenny's play Allegiance, starring Mel Smith, and produced by Daniel Jewel, at the Edinburgh Festival. He is currently a regular guest tutor at the National Film and Television School.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:59:11.780044+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1750, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gilbert_(director)"}], "uuid": "298ab9b4-2a5e-4481-b2a4-aa36b61b86a5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16218", "external_references": [{"id": 7631, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2924898"}, {"id": 7632, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "79173746"}, {"id": 7633, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n92092125"}, {"id": 7634, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n92092125"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:28:32.687174+10:00"}, {"id": 27115, "name": "New Era Entertainment", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2282423, "title": "Tom & Viv", "work_id": 85194, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:02:45.731798+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "fa1dfabc-05f4-4cc4-ba3b-514888ab133e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10899", "external_references": [{"id": 39374, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121034560"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:28:27.478425+10:00"}, {"id": 27114, "name": "IRS media", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2282418, "title": "Tom & Viv", "work_id": 85194, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:02:45.246912+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "e0fec53b-3762-4dcd-b9e2-56ab981b0d14", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "9442", "external_references": [{"id": 36201, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121299258"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:50:16.883407+10:00"}, {"id": 27113, "name": "Samuelson Productions", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2282413, "title": "Tom & Viv", "work_id": 85194, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:02:44.750507+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b7c4cbe9-c187-4cd6-881d-fb66b1955c5d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12267", "external_references": [{"id": 40516, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121035958"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:04:19.486385+10:00"}, {"id": 27112, "name": "Waterhall Productions", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2115154, "title": "Billy Liar", "work_id": 85189, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T12:53:11.206893+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f1248593-08f0-4d62-8ae8-42d6ffd2d106", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14260", "external_references": [{"id": 41305, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121270933"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:12:16.799641+10:00"}, {"id": 27111, "name": "Jerry Lewis", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1989471, "title": "The Nutty professor", "work_id": 85187, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2350438, "title": "The Geisha boy", "work_id": 93466, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2358139, "title": "The Ladies man", "work_id": 94343, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Joseph Levitch", "date_of_birth": "1926-03-16", "date_of_death": "2017-08-20", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Jerry Lewis (born Joseph Levitch; March 16, 1926 â€“ August 20, 2017) was an American comedian, actor, singer, director, producer, writer and humanitarian.

Widely known for his \"kid\" and \"idiot\" persona, his contributions to comedy and charity, along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in pop culture over an eight-decade career. He professionally debuted in 1946 as part of the famous Martin and Lewis with singer Dean Martin and performed with him until 1956, then went solo after the split. \nBy becoming the highest grossing movie star and innovative filmmaker, he helped to develop and popularize \"video assist\", the closed-circuit apparatus enabling film directors to see what had been shot without waiting for developed film footage. In addition to starring in sixty films, Lewis directed 13 movies.

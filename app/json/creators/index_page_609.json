He went on to direct Revolver (2005) and RocknRolla (2008), which were less successful and received mixed reviews. In 2009 and 2011, he directed the box-office hits Sherlock Holmes and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. The former was nominated for Academy Awards in Best Original Score and Best Art Direction.\nHis other directed films include The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015), based on the 1960s television series, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) and Disney's Aladdin (2019), a live-action adaptation of their 1992 animated film, which grossed over $1 billion worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in 2019 and the highest-grossing film of Ritchie's career. In 2019, he returned to crime comedy with The Gentlemen (2019), which was mostly well received and a commercial success. He subsequently reteamed with  Jason Statham on the action films Wrath of Man (2021) and Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre (2023). His second film of 2023, The Covenant, received generally positive reviews.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:06:58.706687+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4121, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Ritchie"}], "uuid": "75c8153f-20c6-40b8-96f7-33c09cf3687c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20150", "external_references": [{"id": 26739, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q192990"}, {"id": 28811, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "33154143"}, {"id": 28812, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr99021758"}, {"id": 28813, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr99021758"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:26:14.584184+10:00"}, {"id": 79415, "name": "Matthew Vaughn", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1994881, "title": "Lock, stock and two smoking barrels [DVD]", "work_id": 90598, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304273, "title": "Snatch [DVD]", "work_id": 91186, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1971-03-07", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Matthew Allard de Vere Drummond (born Matthew Allard Robert Vaughn; 7 March 1971), known professionally as Matthew Vaughn, is an English filmmaker.

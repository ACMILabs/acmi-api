He was editor in chief of Cahiers du cinéma from 1966 to 1978, during which period he wrote the influential essays \"Machines of the Visible\" (1971) and \"Technique and Ideology: Camera, Perspective, Depth of Field\" (1971-2), both of which have been translated in English anthologies of film and media studies.  This work was important in the discussion on apparatus theory, an attempt to rethink cinema as a site for the production and maintenance of dominant state ideology in the wake of May 1968.\nAfter his tenure at Cahiers, Comolli continued his work as a director and has since published numerous works on film theory, documentary, and jazz.  He currently teaches film theory at the Universities of Paris VIII, Barcelona, Strasburg and Genève.In the spring of 2008, Comolli was invited to the Visions du réel documentary film festival in Nyon, Switzerland, where he developed his theory of documentary cinema.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:54:35.735190+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2339, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Comolli"}], "uuid": "927b8749-896c-4956-97b5-66c526a6cf62", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31083", "external_references": [{"id": 10029, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q446583"}, {"id": 10030, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84184126"}, {"id": 10031, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85274443"}, {"id": 10032, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85274443"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-17T17:40:38.957321+10:00"}

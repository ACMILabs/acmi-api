The work is principally about reflecting on the meaning of a site; historically, psychically, and physically. It?s about the saturation of place. The place in our heads and the place on the ground.\" Kobland is currently working on a new film/video work, Who Writes Remains, and a collaborative feature film project with The Wooster Group.\n\nKen Kobland was born in New York in 1946. He studied at Columbia University School of Architecture and Union College. Since 1975 he has worked with the Wooster Group. Kobland has received awards and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; the New York Foundation on the Arts; the D.A.A.D. Berliner Kunstprogramm; the International Center for Video Creation in Montbeliard, France; the Jerome Foundation; and the American Film Institute. His work has been included in film and video festivals in Geneva, Berlin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney, Budapest, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Bangkok, and has been screened at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Biennial; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Arsenal, Berlin.

His works have been adapted into more than 20 films and television dramas.\nCapote rose above a childhood troubled by divorce, a long absence from his mother, and multiple migrations. He had discovered his calling as a writer by the time he was eight years old, and he honed his writing ability throughout his childhood. He began his professional career writing short stories. The critical success of \"Miriam\" (1945) attracted the attention of Random House publisher Bennett Cerf and resulted in a contract to write the novel Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948). Capote earned the most fame with In Cold Blood (1966), a journalistic work about the murder of a Kansas farm family in their home. Capote spent six years writing the book, aided by his lifelong friend Harper Lee, who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:59:17.648695+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6231, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote"}], "uuid": "81551954-f5f8-45f6-bd84-262821134d23", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "32386", "external_references": [{"id": 35248, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q134180"}, {"id": 55999, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "51686739"}, {"id": 56000, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79104227"}, {"id": 56001, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79104227"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T22:37:18.759421+11:00"}, {"id": 6370, "name": "Tom Kalin", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2321042, "title": "Swoon", "work_id": 83970, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994306, "title": "I Shot Andy Warhol [Widescreen]", "work_id": 90084, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2321040, "title": "Swoon", "work_id": 83970, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618013, "title": "Nomads", "work_id": 107939, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2748146, "title": "I Hung back, held fire, danced and lied", "work_id": 107936, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2748126, "title": "Finally destroy us", "work_id": 107935, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618010, "title": "Darling child", "work_id": 107938, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618009, "title": "Dark cave", "work_id": 107937, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1962-01-01", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Tom Kalin's work in film and video traverses diverse genres and forms, from independent feature films to activist television spots and resonant video poems. Kalin has received international recognition as a prominent figure in the New Queer Cinema. His first feature film, Swoon (1992), for which he was director, co-producer, writer and editor, is characterized by his distinctive negotiation of style, narrative, cultural theory and political consciousness.\n\nIn the late 1980s Kalin was a founding member of the AIDS activist collective Gran Fury, which gained attention for its provocative public art projects. His lyrical yet incisive statements on the media representation of gay sexuality and AIDS, as exemplified by They are lost to vision altogether (1989), expanded the definition of activist video.\n\nKalin has produced several prominent independent feature films, including I Shot Andy Warhol (1996) and Go Fish (1994). He co-wrote the screenplay for Cindy Sherman's feature film debut Office Killer (1997), and wrote Somebody's Sins (1997), a feature screenplay about Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith.\n\nKalin continues to work on a smaller scale in video, merging text, music, and poetic images in short experimental pieces that fuse the personal with the political.\n\nTom Kalin was born in 1962 in Chicago. He earned a B.F.A. from the University of Illinois and an M.F.A. from the Art Institute of Chicago, and studied in the Whitney Museum's Independent Study Program. He has written for publications such as Art Forum, Aperture, and The Village Voice, and has taught at California Institute of the Arts, Brown University, and Yale University.

Uthco. Merging satirical dissections of America's media-saturated myths with pop cultural iconography, T.R. Uthco is best known for its 1975 collaboration with Ant Farm, The Eternal Frame. In this reenactment of John F. Kennedy's assassination, and in Ant Farm's Media Burn (1975), Hall plays the role of the media President.\n\nThe use of theatricality and fabricated events as critical strategies is later seen in his own ironic performances (The Speech, 1982; These Are the Rules, 1983), where he appears as a politician or demagogue to deconstruct the gestures, rhetoric, and pageantry of authority, and the manipulative artifice of mass media.\n\nHall terms his inquiry into signs of power in language and image the \"theory of the spectacle,\" and other works extend this discourse to the tension between technology and nature. In an evocation of the Romantic aesthetic of the sublime, Storm and Stress (1986) presents awe-inspiring images of natural and technological phenomena as potent metaphors. Hall's examination of emblematic systems of power has also been articulated in a series of multi-media installations.\n\nDoug Hall was born in 1944. He received a B.A. in anthropology from Harvard University and an M.F.A from the Rinehart School of Sculpture, Maryland Institute of Art. He has received numerous awards, including fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts; a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship; a Fulbright Senior Lecture Fellowship; and a grant from the Contemporary Art Television (CAT) Fund. He is the chairman of the Department of Performance/Video at the San Francisco Art Institute. Hall is the co-editor (with Sally Jo Fifer) of Illuminating Video: An Essential Guide to Video Art (1990).

He filters his themes through a subjective analysis, creating moments of haunting beauty or menace as metaphorical visual expressions.

Charles worked at Johns & Waygood in City Road, South Melbourne progressing from office boy to the machine shop. In 1942 he was nominated to take charge of the Munitions Annex in Montague making 10lb mortar bombs. He purchased an Austin A40 car in 1949 which he kept until 1973 – the car also makes an appearance or two in the home movies!  The family purchased a property at Miller Road, Heathmont, comprising 5 acres of land in 1950 – they had decided to build some sheds and try being poultry farmers.\n\nOver the years the family had numerous cows, ducks, pigs, sheep, dogs, cats and of course Ticka the cockatoo, all these animals were treated as pets. For socialising and fitness Charles with his wife Elsie, joined the local tennis club and enjoyed playing at the weekend. Charles joined the Ringwood Movie Club through some friends and enjoyed the friendship of the club and continued to record their travels with his trusty home movie camera. In 1966 Charles went on to work for another business in Mitcham, so they eased out of the poultry business.\n\nTheir daughter Olwyn married John Baker on the 9th July 1967 and had two sons. Elenor married Ron Peach on 2nd April 1970 and had two daughters – Elenor kindly donated the films to ACMI. Elise and Charles were happily married more than 50 years - these films remain testament to a happy and hard-working family from Melbourne’s outer eastern suburbs.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T10:00:51.789636+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b9277b38-6046-4045-b6f8-b31abd4b42ad", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38910", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}

He has primarily worked in the horror genre, most notably as the writer-director of the commercially successful Jeepers Creepers (2001) and its sequels Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003) and Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017). Outside of horror, Salva wrote and directed the fantasy-drama film Powder (1995).\nSalva's filmmaking career has been controversial due to his 1988 conviction for sexually abusing a 12-year-old actor who starred in his feature film debut Clownhouse (1989) and videotaping the encounter, along with possessing child pornography. This has led to protests against his films, including a boycott of Powder organized by his victim.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:23:08.236266+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3256, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva"}], "uuid": "da9a105e-fb7b-4aee-a483-17cd48e5d99e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30110", "external_references": [{"id": 13779, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q946039"}, {"id": 13780, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "42048260"}, {"id": 13781, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no96025214"}, {"id": 13782, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no96025214"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:05:01.598358+10:00"}

After completing photography and film studies in Australia in 1997, she moved to Europe where she worked as an assistant director, a television producer and a radio journalist.\n\nIn 2003, she graduated with distinction from the University of Westminster¿s MA in Art and Media practice producing a 35mm short film, Thrownness which was exhibited at a solo show in Watermans Gallery, London. Her films and videos have shown in galleries, cinemas, festivals and events both nationally and internationally including Clermont Ferrand Film Festival, Brest Short Film festival, Zebra Poetry Award, 291 Gallery, Prenelle Gallery, Firstdraft Gallery (Australia), Oh!Art, OMSK, Emerge & See and Death in Deptford.\n\nJoanna Callaghan¿s work focuses on the relationship between perception, cognition and representation. She is influenced primarily by cinematic traditions and narrative construction. She is particularly interested in how narrative coherence can be manipulated through isolating structures and processes that contribute to its formation. In this way her work attempts to create narratives which have an integral, essential and evolving relationship with its representative language and thereby generate the possibility of alternative narratives.\n\nShe has lived in Australia, France and Brazil and has travelled widely throughout South America and the Middle East. She speaks French and Spanish.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-05T10:42:52.415923+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "30f8aec6-a11e-4965-8821-85f14da49c4a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2201", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T10:42:52.416241+11:00"}

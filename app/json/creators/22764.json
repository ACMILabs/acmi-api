Formed in 1937, it was originally envisaged as a production company operating in the two cities of London and Rome which gave the company its name.\nThe driving forces behind the company were the flamboyant, Italian-born Filippo Del Giudice, and his partner the multitalented Mario Zampi, born in Sora, Italy who often worked in the dual role of director and producer. Two Cities produced a number of quintessentially English film classics including the most popular British film from the wartime period, In Which We Serve (1942).Other Two Cities films such as This Happy Breed (1944), The Way Ahead (1944), Henry V (1944), The Way to the Stars (1945), and Blithe Spirit (1945) contributed significantly to the high critical reputation acquired by the British cinema of the time.In the mid-1940s Two Cities Films became part of the Rank Organisation. It was raising the finances for the production of Laurence Olivier's patriotic epic Henry V (1944) totalling more than Â£470,000, which forced Filippo Del Giudice to surrender his controlling interest in the company to the Rank Organisation.\nUnder Rank they produced key films such as Odd Man Out (1947), Hamlet (1948), and Vice Versa (1948).\nTwo Cities Films is now owned by Gregory Motton.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:22:10.940914+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5304, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Cities_Films"}], "uuid": "42533c1a-3f38-46a0-a288-69ff7eec4e03", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "13788", "external_references": [{"id": 26940, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3542595"}, {"id": 31883, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "140834492"}, {"id": 31884, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no97045378"}, {"id": 31885, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no97045378"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T17:22:10.961986+10:00"}

Originally known as British Lion Film Corporation Ltd, it entered receivership on 1 June 1954. From 29 January 1955 to 1976, the company was known as British Lion Films Ltd, and was a pure distribution company.\nBritish Lion was founded in November 1927 by Sam W. Smith (brother of Herbert Smith). By the end of the Second World War the company had released over 55 films, including In Which We Serve (1942), for which writer/producer NoÃ«l Coward received an Academy Award. It is best known for the period when it was managed by Sir Alexander Korda. Korda's company London Films bought the controlling interest in British Lion in 1946 and then acquired Shepperton Studios, basing its productions there. In 1949, due to financial problems, the company accepted a loan from the National Film Finance Corporation. Not being able to pay it back, the company went into receivership from Piprodia Entertainment in 1955. As a result, British Lion Films Ltd. was formed as a distribution company in January 1955, with the Boulting brothers, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat as directors. Until 1976 their distributor filmography included 155 films.British Lion Films Ltd was taken over by EMI Films in 1976. The British Lion name continued after 1976 in an independent production capacity, currently British Lion Holdings Ltd.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:16:18.387375+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3682, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Lion_Films"}], "uuid": "65f498bf-083b-4ecb-881d-57ccb52846bb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "6033", "external_references": [{"id": 26942, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2925731"}, {"id": 27602, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "133030569"}, {"id": 27603, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr96016430"}, {"id": 27604, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr96016430"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:11:45.155662+10:00"}, {"id": 17623, "name": "Film Records", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2465319, "title": "Rivers of ice", "work_id": 72276, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-14T10:32:10.010347+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "1f39ee08-f169-4bd1-91bb-d5d8feb7db13", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8242", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-14T10:32:10.010679+10:00"}, {"id": 17621, "name": "Harlech Television", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2250696, "title": "Rivers of delight: the Conway", "work_id": 72275, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T17:10:29.637096+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "ec6c413c-7db2-49c1-bdf6-a307f15fda03", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8994", "external_references": [{"id": 40442, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121270989"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:28:53.145922+10:00"}, {"id": 17617, "name": "Antony Thomas", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 857782, "title": "River of diamonds", "work_id": 72264, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2750528, "title": "Egypt: the struggle for stability", "work_id": 97377, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 828762, "title": "Saudi Arabia: the oil revolution", "work_id": 97378, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "26 JUL 1940", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "3eb966fe-6dbc-4d3a-a5e2-a9128837e7a9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "15441", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T00:25:20.950905+11:00"}, {"id": 17616, "name": "Alan Pendry", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 857779, "title": "The River must live", "work_id": 72263, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2646286, "title": "The Shape of plastics", "work_id": 72726, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "efecdefb-2a1e-4790-87f8-13cb68b6a407", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14789", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:00:55.464142+11:00"}, {"id": 17615, "name": "Arthur D.

At age seven he was resettled in Australia with his family, where he grew up and remained until the late 1960s, attending school in Canberra. In the late 1960s, he founded a market research company in Tokyo, and in 1970, moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Over the course of twenty years, he produced documentaries for PBS and Canadaâs National Film Board. He currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia.He is the co-founder of Adbusters magazine and author of the books Culture Jam and Design Anarchy and is the co-founder of the Adbusters Media Foundation, which owns the magazine. He reportedly started Adbusters after an epiphany that there was something profoundly wrong with consumerism. It happened in a supermarket parking lot. Frustrated that he had to insert a quarter to use a shopping cart, he jammed a bent coin in so that the machine became inoperable.

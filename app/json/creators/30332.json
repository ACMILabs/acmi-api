In addition to his staggering feature output, he also directed one -and two-reel comedy shorts, training films, industrial films, TV episodes and pretty much anything anyone would pay him for. Because of this massive output—he would sometimes direct more than 20 films in a single year—he has been called the most prolific director of the sound era.\nMany of Newfield's films were made for PRC Pictures. This was a film production company headed by his brother Sigmund Neufeld. The films PRC produced were low-budget productions, the majority being westerns, with an occasional horror film or crime drama.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:00:33.804679+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3054, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Newfield"}], "uuid": "ddcd2a97-77d8-42ec-b1bd-5099e1c90dd1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28486", "external_references": [{"id": 12959, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3470531"}, {"id": 12960, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "74115276"}, {"id": 12961, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87896233"}, {"id": 12962, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87896233"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:33.423425+10:00"}

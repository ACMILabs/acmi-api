His images usually contain people or spoken and written words (such as the text from Maurice Blanchot's The Gaze of Orpheus or Wittgenstein's Remarks on Colour). He investigates the conditions of perception with interactive installations. What interests him are the gaps between meaning and reference and where image ends and reality begins. Hill has staged shows in major museums and galleries all over the world. One-person shows have been organised in museums such as Centre Pompidou (1992), I.V.A.M. in Valencia (1993), Stedelijk Van Abbe Museum in Amsterdam (1993) and in many American institutions. At the Venice Biennale (1995), Hill presented a labyrinth of 'words' which were activated by the presence of the viewer and which created different discourses according to the paths taken. In Australia he is exhibiting his Tall Ships, ('the one undisputed hit of Documenta IX and the 1993 Whitney Biennial, and remains one of the most compelling works of the last decade'), a long and dark corridor that the viewer can walk through, while activating moving images of human figures on the walls as they are approached.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T23:01:07.615917+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4015, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hill"}], "uuid": "b67a3ba2-975d-4e22-80b8-10c36ea9c932", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110737", "external_references": [{"id": 26210, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2545780"}, {"id": 28524, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "96095476"}, {"id": 28525, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n93075444"}, {"id": 28526, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n93075444"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T23:01:07.616129+11:00"}, {"id": 7132, "name": "Luc Courchesne", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2710218, "title": "The Visitor: living by number [documentation]", "work_id": 108253, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Luc Courchesne (Canada b.1952)\n\nLuc Courchesne began his explorations in interactive visitor-triggered video in 1984 when he co-authored Elastic Movies with Bill Seamen among others at MIT.

He has had a solo show at Museum of Modern Art in New York. These experiments with conversational interfaces have been elaborated to give the impression of communication between visitors and virtual beings. The video sequences are stored on laser-disc and displayed as reflections on a glass plate positioned directly above the video projection. Of late, Courchesne has tried to make a more closed sense of space, and to create a better sense of immersion. His latest work is with interactive devices set in a single-channel panoramic viewer, Panoscope 360, a doughnut-shaped anamorphic video, which gives a seamless image and uses voice for input.

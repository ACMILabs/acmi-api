His work includes commercials, film, music videos, skateboard videos and television.\nJonze began his career as a teenager photographing BMX riders and skateboarders for Freestylin' Magazine and Transworld Skateboarding, and co-founding the youth culture magazine Dirt. Moving into filmmaking, he began shooting street skateboarding films, including the influential Video Days (1991). Jonze co-founded the skateboard company Girl Skateboards in 1993 with riders Rick Howard and Mike Carroll. Jonze's filmmaking style made him an in-demand director of music videos for much of the 1990s, resulting in collaborations with R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Beastie Boys, Ween, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, Weezer, Björk, Arcade Fire and Kanye West. \nJonze began his feature film directing career with Being John Malkovich (1999) and Adaptation (2002), both written by Charlie Kaufman; the former earned Jonze an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. He was a co-creator and executive producer of MTV's Jackass reality franchise. Jonze later began directing films based on his own screenplays, including Where the Wild Things Are (2009) and Her (2013); for the latter film, he won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay, while receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song (\"The Moon Song\").\nHe has worked as an actor sporadically throughout his career, co-starring in David O. Russell's war comedy Three Kings (1999) and appearing in supporting roles in Bennett Miller's Moneyball (2011) and Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), in addition to a recurring role in comedy series The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret  (2010–2012) and cameo appearances in his own films. Jonze co-founded Directors Label, with filmmakers Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry, and the Palm Pictures company. He is currently the creative director of Vice Media, Inc. and its multinational television channel Vice on TV.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:08:28.314563+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5185, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_Jonze"}], "uuid": "cf65c7d7-7b3b-4a9d-ae20-3af6ce4b8286", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28916", "external_references": [{"id": 24950, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q259913"}, {"id": 31586, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "19880868"}, {"id": 31587, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no00038713"}, {"id": 31588, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no00038713"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:25:25.002432+10:00"}, {"id": 79823, "name": "Vincent Landay", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2270877, "title": "The Work of director Spike Jonze", "work_id": 94962, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111091, "title": "Being John Malkovich [DVD]", "work_id": 92455, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2081315, "title": "Adaptation", "work_id": 94876, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "2000-01-01", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "biography": "Vincent Landay is a Canadian-American film producer.

He is known for his vocal quality, poetic lyrics and unique stage presence.\nPossessing a distinctive voice, Stipe has been noted for the \"mumbling\" style of his early career. Since the mid-1980s, Stipe has sung in \"wailing, keening, arching vocal figures\" that R.E.M. biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin. He was in charge of R.E.M.'s visual aspect, often selecting album artwork and directing many of the band's music videos. Outside the music industry, he owns and runs two film production studios, C-00 and Single Cell Pictures.\nAs a member of R.E.M., Stipe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. As a singer-songwriter, Stipe influenced a wide range of artists, including Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. Bono of U2 has described his voice as \"extraordinary\", and Yorke told The Guardian that Stipe is his favorite lyricist, saying \"I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:16:20.336505+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4714, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe"}], "uuid": "372ef8c7-dddc-4b40-9888-bdbfb58ae637", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25234", "external_references": [{"id": 25470, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q215182"}, {"id": 30365, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84964040"}, {"id": 30366, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91125827"}, {"id": 30367, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91125827"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:09:56.001139+10:00"}, {"id": 79820, "name": "Isabelle Pragier", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2212497, "title": "Early frost", "work_id": 92444, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T15:48:25.404828+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2a1e6c65-20ce-4d2c-97a2-c64a6f2dfac4", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20905", "external_references": [{"id": 32266, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121271450"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:51:33.755569+10:00"}, {"id": 79819, "name": "Laurent Lavole", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2212493, "title": "Early frost", "work_id": 92444, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T15:48:25.157883+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "11428dbe-bc8c-4f29-b70d-f43918dab77f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23556", "external_references": [{"id": 38299, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121036575"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:16:26.311867+10:00"}, {"id": 79818, "name": "Marc Abraham", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2076456, "title": "A Thousand acres", "work_id": 92438, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2125231, "title": "Bring it on [DVD]", "work_id": 94288, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1949-05-28", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Marc Abraham is an American film producer, director, and former president of Strike Entertainment, a production company he launched in early 2002 with a multi-year, first look arrangement with Universal Pictures.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:02:11.334816+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4596, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Abraham"}], "uuid": "734e7890-adf7-4162-a516-950b62b54a8f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24270", "external_references": [{"id": 25688, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2446795"}, {"id": 30071, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "78848051"}, {"id": 30072, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n2009008784"}, {"id": 30073, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n2009008784"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:38:56.830229+10:00"}, {"id": 79817, "name": "Via Rosa", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2076453, "title": "A Thousand acres", "work_id": 92438, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T11:41:33.321119+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3ecb5ce3-9476-4607-b866-23977582474e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14043", "external_references": [{"id": 34338, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121034514"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:03:53.344218+10:00"}, {"id": 79816, "name": "Ray Taylor", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2352613, "title": "The Green hornet.

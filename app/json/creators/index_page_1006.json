Pojar served as a puppeteer under his mentor Trnka.\n\nPojar compiled an extensive body of work as a director and animator in Czechoslovakia, where he made films in both puppet animation to the more common stop motion animation.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pojar emigrated to Canada, where he began a long collaboration with the National Film Board. His Canadian work is some of his best known, and it has won awards at prestigious international film festivals. His film To See or Not to See (Psychocratie) won the Canadian Film Award for Film of the Year in 1970.Pojar's work is characterized by strong social commentary, such as in Balablok, where armies of small circle- and square-shaped beings war with each other until they are all wounded into indistinguishable shapes. Often, Pojar's shorts contain little or no spoken dialogue.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Pojar moved back to the Czech film business in order to co-direct the collaborative animated feature film Fimfárum 2 (based on the stories of Jan Werich), which was released in 2006.\n\nPojar died in Prague at the age of 89 in 2012.

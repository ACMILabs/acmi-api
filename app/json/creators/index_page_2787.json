The CD Rom has exhibited in shows from Melbourne, America to Japan.\n\nHis work primarily deals with human behaviour. In 2000, he continued working with the performing arts industry. As a producer and director, he extracted elements from the CD Rom and transformed Multiple Xposure into a multimedia dance performance titled LUCID. It was performed to a full house at Revolver Upstairs for Melbourne Fringe Festival. LUCID deals with the issues in religious beliefs, homosexuality, violence and psychology. Again he worked with composer Brett Aplin who composed the soundscape to Multiple Xposure. LUCID received rave reviews and was awarded Melbourne Fringe Movement Award for Definition of New Boundaries. LUCID was also performed at St Kilda Film Festival Fusion at The George Ballroom, St Kilda in 2001.\n\nHe was commissioned by David Pledger from Not Yet Its Difficult to work on his play titled ¿K¿, a theatrical piece using projected images interacting with the actors about surveillance.

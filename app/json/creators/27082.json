On July 4, 1939, he was sent from Germany to France to escape the Nazis efforts to kill Jews. At age 10, he settled into a foster home in the Bronx, New York. Graham graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and subsequently from City College with a business degree.\nIn the early 1960s, Graham moved to San Francisco, and, in 1965, began to manage the San Francisco Mime Troupe. He had teamed up with local Haight Ashbury promoter Chet Helms and Family Dog, and their network of contacts, to organize a benefit concert, then promoted several free concerts. This eventually turned into a profitable full-time career and he assembled a talented staff. Graham had a profound influence around the world, sponsoring the musical renaissance of the '60s from the epicenter, San Francisco.  Chet Helms and then Bill Graham made famous the Fillmore and Winterland Ballroom; these turned out to be a proving grounds for rock bands and acts of the San Francisco Bay area including the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, who were first managed, and in some cases developed, by Chet Helms.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:57:05.031737+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1728, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Graham_(promoter)"}], "uuid": "46cc2eea-942e-407d-8f57-097bd878bfa1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "5854", "external_references": [{"id": 7534, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q862152"}, {"id": 7535, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "47564040"}, {"id": 7536, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91015400"}, {"id": 7537, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91015400"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:21:34.065927+11:00"}

Stark's background as a literary and theatrical agent prepared him to produce some of the most profitable films of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, such as The World of Suzie Wong (1960), West Side Story (1961), The Misfits (1961), Lolita (1962), The Night of the Iguana (1964), Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), Funny Girl (1968), The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), The Goodbye Girl (1977), The Toy (1982), Annie (1982), and Steel Magnolias (1989).\nIn addition to his roster of films, Stark formed relationships with various directors and writers throughout his career. Stark made eight films with Herbert Ross, five with John Huston, and three with Sydney Pollack. Additionally, Stark's 18-year partnership with playwright Neil Simon yielded 11 films between the duo, including The Goodbye Girl (1977) and The Sunshine Boys (1975). In 1980, the Motion Picture Academy awarded him the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for lifetime of achievement in film.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:47:55.056910+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2914, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Stark"}], "uuid": "e8dc53e9-f4f6-4aeb-9391-274282f105ab", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27176", "external_references": [{"id": 12397, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q466254"}, {"id": 12398, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "20779283"}, {"id": 12399, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr93000372"}, {"id": 12400, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr93000372"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:07.853747+10:00"}

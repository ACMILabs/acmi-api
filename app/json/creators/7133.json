Often viewed as one of the foundational artists in video art, based on the single-channel work and video- and sound-based installations of the 1970s and 1980s, he in fact began working in metal sculpture in the late 1960s. Today he is best known for internationally exhibited installations and performance art, concerned as much with innovative language as with technology, and for continuing work in a broad range of media. His longtime work with intermedia explores an array of issues ranging from the physicality of language, synesthesia and perceptual conundrums to ontological space and viewer interactivity. The recipient of many awards, his influential work has been exhibited in most major contemporary art museums worldwide.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:54:25.805366+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4015, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hill"}], "uuid": "b67a3ba2-975d-4e22-80b8-10c36ea9c932", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110737", "external_references": [{"id": 26210, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2545780"}, {"id": 28524, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "96095476"}, {"id": 28525, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n93075444"}, {"id": 28526, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n93075444"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:29:32.613007+10:00"}

Norton was drawn to theatrical productions at local venues as a child. After graduating from Yale College in 1991, he worked for a few months in Japan before moving to Manhattan to pursue an acting career. He gained immediate recognition and critical acclaim for his debut in Primal Fear (1996), which earned him a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. His role as a redeemed neo-Nazi in American History X (1998) earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He also starred in the film Fight Club (1999), which garnered a cult following.\nNorton established the production company Class 5 Films in 2003, and was director or producer of the films Keeping the Faith (2000), Down in the Valley (2005), and The Painted Veil (2006). He continued to receive critical acclaim for his acting roles in films such as The Score (2001), 25th Hour (2002), The Illusionist (2006), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). His biggest commercial successes have been Red Dragon (2002), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), The Incredible Hulk (2008), and The Bourne Legacy (2012). For his role in the black comedy Birdman (2014), Norton earned another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Norton has since directed and acted in the crime film Motherless Brooklyn (2019), and starred in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022).\nDespite critical plaudits, Norton has gained notoriety for being difficult to work with, including incidents such as editing the final cuts and rewriting screenplays against the will of other producers. He is discreet about his personal life and has expressed no interest in being a celebrity. Besides acting and filmmaking, he is an environmental activist and social entrepreneur. He is a trustee of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization that advocates for affordable housing, and serves as president of the American branch of the Maasai Wilderness Conservation Trust. He is also the UN Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity. He is married to Canadian film producer Shauna Robertson, with whom he has a son. In March 2022, on the day of another sentencing of Russian opposition leader and political prisoner Alexei Navalny, Norton became the first celebrity sponsor of the international Anti-Corruption Foundation.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T19:26:21.031764+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1979, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton"}], "uuid": "1a8bc95e-6d26-4c7b-8879-06b08d31ae64", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18619", "external_references": [{"id": 8560, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q125904"}, {"id": 8561, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "85514067"}, {"id": 8562, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no97043381"}, {"id": 8563, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no97043381"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:26:23.096031+10:00"}, {"id": 81138, "name": "Don MacBain", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2184515, "title": "Deep blue sea", "work_id": 95045, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:58:32.261202+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "386ccf03-4d52-4767-94ad-6476388043fa", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18228", "external_references": [{"id": 33518, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121036496"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:15:35.357926+10:00"}, {"id": 81137, "name": "Robert Kosberg", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2184507, "title": "Deep blue sea", "work_id": 95045, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:58:31.803644+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "17ada06b-c1d8-43b2-9678-b830aa165ebe", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27790", "external_references": [{"id": 40426, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121143968"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T00:43:22.631110+10:00"}]}

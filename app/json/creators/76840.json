He also produced such classic films as The Lady Vanishes (1938). Black has been called \"one of the unsung heroes of the British film industry\" and \"one of the greatest figures in British film history, the maker of stars like Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, John Mills and Stewart Granger. He was also one of the very few producers whose films, over a considerable period, made money.\" In 1946 Mason called Black \"the one good production executive\" that J. Arthur Rank had. Frank Launder called Black \"a great showman and yet he had a great feeling for scripts and spent more time on them than anyone I have ever known. His experimental films used to come off as successful as his others.\"Black specialized in making comedies, thrillers and low-budget musicals. He had a lot of success making comedy vehicles for stars such as Will Hay and Arthur Askey. He also produced early films from Carol Reed and Alfred Hitchcock and was an early supporter of writer directors Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:44:52.425029+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1974, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Black_(producer)"}], "uuid": "221760e2-2900-4508-9ceb-9cd6e05a28c0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18582", "external_references": [{"id": 8540, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5341908"}, {"id": 8541, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "144245664"}, {"id": 8542, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr97035349"}, {"id": 8543, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr97035349"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:44:52.453190+10:00"}

Her most recent work, a gesture-controlled video tool (developed during a Waikato Artist Residency Program, New Zealand), explored cultural gestures and mapping. Richards has written and directed the CD-ROM Elementia, a set of 11 maps created by fictional cartographers. She was multimedia producer on the large-scale virtual mapping project TimeMap, distributed for the Museum of Sydney in collaboration with the Archaeological Computing Lab, University of Sydney.

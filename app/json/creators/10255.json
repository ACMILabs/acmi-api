Founded in 1853, it is Australia's second oldest university and the oldest in Victoria. Its main campus is located in Parkville, an inner suburb north of Melbourne's central business district, with several other campuses located across Victoria.\nIncorporated in the 19th century by the colony of Victoria, the University of Melbourne is one of Australia's six sandstone universities and a member of the Group of Eight, Universitas 21, Washington University's McDonnell International Scholars Academy, and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. Since 1872, many residential colleges have become affiliated with the university, providing accommodation for students and faculty, and academic, sporting and cultural programs. There are ten colleges located on the main campus and in nearby suburbs.\nThe university comprises ten separate academic units and is associated with numerous institutes and research centres, including the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research and the Grattan Institute. The university has fifteen graduate schools, including the Melbourne Business School, the Melbourne Law School and the Melbourne Medical School.Four Australian prime ministers and five governors-general have graduated from the University of Melbourne. Eight Nobel Laureates have taught, studied and researched at the University of Melbourne, the most of any Australian university.The university's coat of arms is a blue shield on which a depiction of \"Victory\" in white colour holds her laurel wreath over the stars of the Southern Cross. The motto, Postera crescam laude (\"Later I shall grow by praise\" or, more freely, \"We shall grow in the esteem of future generations\"), is written on a scroll beneath the shield. The Latin is from a line in Horace's Odes: ego postera crescam laude recens.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T02:01:25.601591+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6236, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Melbourne"}], "uuid": "1106845b-eea6-4a30-9759-6cb1a7e68665", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4374", "external_references": [{"id": 33506, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q319078"}, {"id": 56013, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "146316977"}, {"id": 56014, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79054099"}, {"id": 56015, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79054099"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T01:07:27.339624+11:00"}

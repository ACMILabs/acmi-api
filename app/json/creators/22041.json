Born István Székely, he was known by several names, based on his changing professional and immigration status, including Stefan Szekely.\nHe directed films in Hungarian, German, and English.\nHe worked as a newspaper journalist in Germany, before returning to Hungary in the early 1930s. He directed one of the most famous classic Hungarian films, the frequently revived comedy Hyppolit, a lakáj (1931). That film was remade in 2000 and the original was later digitally restored and released on DVD.\nSekely left pre-war Hungary, fleeing growing Fascism and laws restricting rights and professional opportunities for Jews.\nHe worked in Hollywood for much of his subsequent career, directing mostly B movies and early episodic TV, although he directed his best-known English language film, the cult science fiction thriller The Day of the Triffids in the UK and returned to Hungary to direct his final film, The Girl Who Liked Purple Flowers, which was released in 1973.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:09:59.609666+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3154, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sekely"}], "uuid": "ebf7f3e4-8c8c-49c8-890d-bfb9f919d766", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29163", "external_references": [{"id": 13372, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q549626"}, {"id": 13373, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "74115538"}, {"id": 13374, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79023660"}, {"id": 13375, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79023660"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:47:23.410342+11:00"}

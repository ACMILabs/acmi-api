Known as part of a motorcycle racing dynasty, Michael is the brother of William Dunlop, son of Robert Dunlop and nephew of former World Champion Joey Dunlop.He won the Armoy road race on 27 July 2019 just 16 days after breaking his pelvis. The victories were Dunlop's 18th and 19th around his home circuit at Armoy.\nHe is a former solo-machine lap record holder for the Snaefell Mountain Course set during the 2016 Senior TT in a time of 16 minutes 53.929 seconds at an average speed of 133.962 mph (215.591 km/h). Dunlop was the first rider in the history of the Isle of Man TT to achieve a lap of the course in under 17 minutes.\nDunlop was described in 2015 as having \"an aggressive style\" which was \"spectacular to watch\". This pugnacious attitude has led to numerous confrontations with race teams, rival competitors and on occasion, his late brother. In addition he has often refused to acknowledge the names of his fellow competitors.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:13:21.138736+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4683, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunlop"}], "uuid": "2ea2f6cf-ceb2-4b0d-9231-c278833155e3", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25052", "external_references": [{"id": 26905, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6829989"}, {"id": 30292, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "3490152988205412790007"}, {"id": 30293, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nb2018011856"}, {"id": 30294, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nb2018011856"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:24.888848+10:00"}

W. Fassbinder, was a German filmmaker, actor, playwright, theatre director, composer, editor, and essayist. He is widely regarded as a prominent figure and catalyst of the New German Cinema movement.\nHis first feature-length film was a gangster movie called Love Is Colder Than Death (1969); he scored his first domestic commercial success with The Merchant of Four Seasons (1972) and his first international success with Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (1974), both of which are considered masterpieces by contemporary critics. Big-budget projects such as Despair (1978), Lili Marleen and Lola (both 1981) followed.\nHis greatest success came with The Marriage of Maria Braun (1979), chronicling the rise and fall of a German woman in the wake of World War II. Other notable films include The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972), Fox and His Friends (1975), Satan's Brew (1976), In a Year with 13 Moons (1978), and Querelle (1982), all of which focused on gay and lesbian themes.\nFassbinder died on 10 June 1982, at age 37, from a lethal cocktail of cocaine and barbiturates. His career lasted less than two decades, but he was extremely prolific; he completed over 40 feature films, two television series, three short films, four video productions, and 24 plays.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:46:34.125290+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2902, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder"}], "uuid": "c176b048-2753-448e-90c3-62fb03dc0249", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27065", "external_references": [{"id": 12344, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q44426"}, {"id": 12345, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "66467014"}, {"id": 12346, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50011988"}, {"id": 12347, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50011988"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:32:08.010239+11:00"}

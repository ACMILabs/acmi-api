One of Stephen's first works in 1975 was made with an audio synthesiser being fed into an oscilliscope that traced and layered the patterns of the sounds. He built his first `real' video synthesiser in 1979. In 1982 he established the highly influential post-production facility Heuristic Video and began his ten-year association as videomaker for the music group Severed Heads.\n\nIn providing technical support for numerous performance and video artists (including Nam June Paik and Charlotte Moorman) he has developed a range of techniques using the Fairlight CVI, the conjure computer graphics system and the Amiga computer.\n\nJones is particularly interested in organisation and self-regulating systems along with developing a visual language to communicate complex ideas.For the past twenty-five years Jones has been copnducting research into the relationship between neuroscience and the nature of consciousness, culminating in The Brain Project, a web site which has been in development since 1996.\n\nJones is the recipient of an Australia Council Fellowship, through the New Media Arts Fund. He now works as a consultant electronic engineer and builder of video studios.\n\nReferences:\nDead Eyes Opened , 1982-85, colour, sound, ? min\nHot with Fleas , 1986-87, colour, sound, ? min\nThe Brain Project , 1996, web site\nBibliography:\nMazurek, Amy An Interview with Stephen Jones and Tom Ellard, March 1994\nVideos by Severed Heads http://www.sevcom.com/video.htm", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T22:45:15.505511+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c557da05-6e45-4f4e-a2c1-17dece84b460", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110064", "external_references": [{"id": 41660, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121337572"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T22:45:15.505854+11:00"}, {"id": 6494, "name": "Ohio State University", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 881934, "title": "Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse", "work_id": 92957, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2712063, "title": "Developmental evaluation in infancy", "work_id": 66756, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2632973, "title": "Fire of time", "work_id": 107974, "role": "support", "role_id": 492, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:53:44.930946+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f02e5a78-e174-4881-96b5-24538369845e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110495", "external_references": [{"id": 38487, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121035597"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T00:10:04.506965+11:00"}, {"id": 6483, "name": "Peter Hennessey", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2618595, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2632955, "title": "Screen Gallery scaling visualisation", "work_id": 107973, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2636104, "title": "My Woomera Project (What do you fear?)", "work_id": 109439, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618591, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 3097904, "title": "Closer", "work_id": 108388, "role": "interface design", "role_id": 574, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2618599, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1968", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Peter Hennessey is an artist whose work encompasses sculpture, video and interactive media.

O'Brien (for which the latter won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects); his first color film, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958); and Jason and the Argonauts (1963), which featured a sword fight with seven skeleton warriors. His last film was Clash of the Titans (1981), after which he retired.\n\nIn 1960, Harryhausen moved to the United Kingdom and became a dual American-British citizen. He lived in London until his death in 2013. During his life, his innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers. In November 2016 the BFI compiled a list of those present-day filmmakers who claim to have been inspired by Harryhausen, including Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Joe Dante, Tim Burton, Nick Park, James Cameron, and Guillermo del Toro. Others influenced by him include George Lucas, John Lasseter, John Landis, Henry Selick, J. J. Abrams, and Wes Anderson.

Jarre composed the scores to all of Lean's films from Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to A Passage to India (1984). He was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning three in the Best Original Score category for Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago (1965), and A Passage to India, all of which were directed by Lean.\nNotable scores for other directors included Eyes Without a Face (1959), The Longest Day (1962), The Train (1964), The Collector (1965), Grand Prix (1966), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), Mohammad, Messenger of God (1976), Jesus of Nazareth (1977), Lion of the Desert (1981), The Year of Living Dangerously (1982), Witness (1985), The Mosquito Coast (1986), Fatal Attraction (1987), Gorillas in the Mist (1988), Dead Poets Society (1989), Prancer (1989), and Ghost (1990).

Three of his compositions spent a total of 42 weeks on the UK singles chart; the biggest hit was \"Somewhere My Love\" (to his tune \"Lara's Theme\", with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) performed by the Mike Sammes Singers, which reached Number 14 in 1966 and spent 38 weeks on the chart.\nHe was the father of musician Jean-Michel Jarre and the adopted father of screenwriter Kevin Jarre.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:10:14.317457+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4658, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Jarre"}], "uuid": "c0ff7fb9-339a-4f93-b4e8-19bd0ae903a8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34328", "external_references": [{"id": 26787, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q105487"}, {"id": 30228, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "66652116"}, {"id": 30229, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82013480"}, {"id": 30230, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82013480"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:56:28.105124+10:00"}, {"id": 76694, "name": "Hilton Bonner", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 899861, "title": "Hard knocks", "work_id": 80720, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "34c25d42-3128-43a2-98cb-625dc99cf02f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 33323, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121079040"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:39:29.039110+10:00"}, {"id": 76693, "name": "Peter Cook", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2649063, "title": "The Adventures of Barry McKenzie", "work_id": 80719, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "17 NOV 1937", "date_of_death": "09 JAN 1995", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Peter Edward Cook (17 November 1937 – 9 January 1995) was an English comedian, actor, satirist, playwright and screenwriter. He was the leading figure of the British satire boom of the 1960s, and he was associated with the anti-establishment comedic movement that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s.\n\nBorn in Torquay, he was educated at the University of Cambridge. There he became involved with the Footlights Club, of which he later became president. After graduating he created the comedy stage revue Beyond the Fringe, beginning a long-running partnership with Dudley Moore. In 1961, Cook opened the comedy club The Establishment in Soho, Central London. In 1965, Cook and Moore began a television career, beginning with Not Only... But Also. Cook’s deadpan monologues contrasted with Moore’s buffoonery. They received the 1966 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Performance. Following the success of the show, the duo appeared together in the films The Wrong Box (1966) and Bedazzled (1967). Cook and Moore returned to television projects continuing to the late 1970s, including co-presenting Saturday Night Live in the United States. From 1978 until his death in 1995, Cook no longer collaborated with Moore, apart from a few cameo appearances but continued to be a regular performer in British television and film.\n\nReferred to as \"the father of modern satire\" by The Guardian in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the Comedians' Comedian, a poll of more than 300 comics, comedy writers, producers and directors in the English-speaking world.

He appeared in numerous stage productions, films, and television shows.

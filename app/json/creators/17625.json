Originally known as British Lion Film Corporation Ltd, it entered receivership on 1 June 1954. From 29 January 1955 to 1976, the company was known as British Lion Films Ltd, and was a pure distribution company.\nBritish Lion was founded in November 1927 by Sam W. Smith (brother of Herbert Smith). By the end of the Second World War the company had released over 55 films, including In Which We Serve (1942), for which writer/producer NoÃ«l Coward received an Academy Award. It is best known for the period when it was managed by Sir Alexander Korda. Korda's company London Films bought the controlling interest in British Lion in 1946 and then acquired Shepperton Studios, basing its productions there. In 1949, due to financial problems, the company accepted a loan from the National Film Finance Corporation. Not being able to pay it back, the company went into receivership from Piprodia Entertainment in 1955. As a result, British Lion Films Ltd. was formed as a distribution company in January 1955, with the Boulting brothers, Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat as directors. Until 1976 their distributor filmography included 155 films.British Lion Films Ltd was taken over by EMI Films in 1976. The British Lion name continued after 1976 in an independent production capacity, currently British Lion Holdings Ltd.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:16:18.387375+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3682, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Lion_Films"}], "uuid": "65f498bf-083b-4ecb-881d-57ccb52846bb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "6033", "external_references": [{"id": 26942, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2925731"}, {"id": 27602, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "133030569"}, {"id": 27603, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr96016430"}, {"id": 27604, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr96016430"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:16:18.412393+10:00"}

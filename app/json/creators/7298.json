Her current works-in-progress,\nAS WE MAY WRITE and WRITING IN BITS explore writing and the human-computer interface.\n\nSally began working with computers in 1979. In' 83 she retrained as one of Australia's earliest 3D computer animators, making her 3D film DREAM HOUSE, the first Australian work selected for the prestigious SIGGRAPH screenings in the USA ('84). After working as a commercial computer animator in the USA and Australia, Sally switched to desktop computers and an exploration of art, technology, subjectivity and gender. Sally was actively involved in the early days of the Australian Art and Technology scene, widely exhibiting, lecturing and writing about these themes.\n\nSally's landmark paper THINKING OF ONESLEF AS A COMPUTER was published in Leonardo in '91. Her video COMPUTERS ARE FUN (or BARBIE MEETS THE COMPUTER) was later ('94) selected for An Eccentric Orbit, a major survey of video art in Australia, which premiered at the Museum of Modern Art, NY.\n\nIn late '91 Sally left Australia for Tunis, North Africa. Her experiences, which included marrying a Tunisian man, led several years later to the production of POSTCARD FROM TUNIS.\n\nIn '97, Sally was awarded the inaugural Elektra Award for a woman with outstanding achievements in the area of new technology, by WIFT (Women in Film and Television) Australia.\n\nIn '98 Sally left her lecturing position at the University of Technology in order to concentrate on artistic productions and her doctoral studies at the University of Western Sydney. In 1999 she was awarded a two year artistic fellowship from the New Media Fund of the Australia Council and moved from Bondi to Ballarat, in rural Victoria.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-05T13:41:44.417169+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "aa788720-a700-47e6-b39a-89046abf7148", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110858", "external_references": [{"id": 40588, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121337612"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:41:44.417383+11:00"}

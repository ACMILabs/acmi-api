For much of his career he co-produced and co-directed films with his wife, fellow filmmaker Judith MacDougall.  In 1972, his first film, To Live with Herds was awarded the Grand Prix \"Venezia Genti\" at the Venice Film Festival. He has lived in Australia since 1975, and is currently a professor in the Research School of Humanities & the Arts at Australian National University.\n\nMacDougall has produced films covering a wide range of subjects, be it the semi-nomadic Turkana people of Kenya in The Wedding Camels or an elite North Indian boys' boarding school in The Doon School Quintet. Influenced by cinéma vérité and Direct Cinema in the 1960s, he is considered to be one of the pioneers of observational cinema, films that present the observations of an individual filmmaker, whose perspective is shared with the viewer. He has advocated “participatory cinema” in which the subjects of documentary films are more fully involved in their creation. He was one of the first ethnographic filmmakers to eschew explanatory narration and employ longer takes, using subtitles to translate the speech of people in other cultures. His films have also explored what he has termed “social aesthetics,” the combination of manners, everyday rituals, textures, colors, architectural forms, and material objects that create the distinctive character of a community.MacDougall is considered one of the most prominent theorists in visual anthropology. Both Judith and David are considered to be among the most significant anthropological filmmakers in the English-speaking world. In 2013, MacDougall received the Life Achievement Award from the Royal Anthropological Institute in London.

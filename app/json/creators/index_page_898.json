Charles Nicholas Branson (born 18 July 1950) is a British business magnate and commercial astronaut.  In the 1970s he founded the Virgin Group, which today controls more than 400 companies in various fields.Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called Student. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as Virgin Megastores—in 1972. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he started the Virgin Atlantic airline and expanded the Virgin Records music label. In 1997, Branson founded the Virgin Rail Group to bid for passenger rail franchises, during the privatisation of British Rail. The Virgin Trains brand operated the InterCity West Coast franchise from 1997 to 2019, the InterCity CrossCountry franchise from 1997 to 2007, and the InterCity East Coast franchise from 2015 to 2018. In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation Virgin Galactic, based at Mojave Air and Space Port in California, noted for the SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane designed for space tourism.\nIn March 2000, Branson was knighted at Buckingham Palace for \"services to entrepreneurship\". For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure and for his humanitarian work, he has become a prominent global figure. In 2007, he was placed in the Time 100 Most Influential People in the World list. In June 2023, Forbes listed Branson's estimated net worth at US$3 billion.On 11 July 2021, Branson travelled as a passenger onboard Virgin Galactic Unity 22 at the edge of space, a suborbital test flight for his spaceflight company Virgin Galactic. The mission lasted approximately one hour, reaching a peak altitude of 53.5 miles (86.1 km). At 70, Branson became the third oldest person to fly to space.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T00:28:08.330761+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2930, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson"}], "uuid": "11807390-d5c0-4683-8af5-dab826f74503", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27334", "external_references": [{"id": 12459, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q194419"}, {"id": 12460, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84074806"}, {"id": 12461, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87888343"}, {"id": 12462, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87888343"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:48:01.915206+11:00"}, {"id": 76518, "name": "Shirley Temple", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1984293, "title": "The Little princess", "work_id": 79686, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2239972, "title": "Heidi", "work_id": 84206, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2240068, "title": "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm", "work_id": 84677, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2240094, "title": "The Shirley Temple collection", "work_id": 115383, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2240120, "title": "The Little Colonel", "work_id": 84614, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986493, "title": "The Littlest rebel (Captioned)", "work_id": 82747, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2240146, "title": "Dimples", "work_id": 84208, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2614758, "title": "Bright eyes", "work_id": 84210, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 885404, "title": "The Shirley Temple collector's classic", "work_id": 95353, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2149614, "title": "Curly Top (Captioned)", "work_id": 81700, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1999056, "title": "The Story of Seabiscuit = Pride of Kentucky", "work_id": 94272, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Shirley Jane Temple", "date_of_birth": "23 APR 1928", "date_of_death": "10 FEB 2014", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Shirley Temple Black (born Shirley Jane Temple; April 23, 1928 – February 10, 2014) was an American actress, singer, dancer, and diplomat, who was Hollywood's number-one box-office draw as a child actress from 1934 to 1938. Later, she was named United States Ambassador to Ghana and Czechoslovakia, and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States.\n\nTemple began her film career at the age of three in 1931. Two years later, she achieved international fame in Bright Eyes, a feature film produced especially for her talents. She received a special Juvenile Academy Award in February 1935 for her outstanding contribution as a juvenile performer in motion pictures during 1934. Film hits such as Curly Top and Heidi followed year after year during the mid- to late 1930s. Temple capitalized on licensed merchandise that featured her wholesome image; the merchandise included dolls, dishes, and clothing. Her box-office popularity waned as she reached adolescence. She appeared in 29 films from the ages of 3 to 10, but in only 14 films from the ages of 14 to 21. Temple retired from film in 1950 at the age of 22.In 1958, Temple returned to show business with a two-season television anthology series of fairy tale adaptations called Shirley Temple's Storybook, which was very popular at the time. She made guest appearances on television shows in the early 1960s and filmed a sitcom pilot that was never released. She sat on the boards of corporations and organizations, including the Walt Disney Company, Del Monte Foods, and the National Wildlife Federation.\n\nShe began her diplomatic career in 1969, when she was appointed to represent the United States at a session of the United Nations General Assembly, where she worked at the U.S. Mission under Ambassador Charles W. Yost. Later, she was named United States Ambassador to Ghana, and also served as the first female Chief of Protocol of the United States. In 1988, she published her autobiography, Child Star. After her biography was published, she served as the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992).\n\nTemple was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the Kennedy Center Honors and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. She is 18th on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest female American screen legends of classic Hollywood cinema.

Reading \"between the lines\" to decode the subjective and objective meanings and\ninterpretations of media language and images, Muntadas\nanalyzes the consumption of information and the process by\nwhich it is mediated and manipulated for power, propaganda,\nand profit. Strategies of fragmentation, decomposition, isolation, reframing, and disintegration of words and images are integral to his inquiry into how facts and information are mediated or contextualized for the viewer/reader. Deconstructing the form of what he terms the \"ecology\" of the media -- cinema and television credits, advertising slogans, the editing of a news story -- he deciphers how its ideological content functions in relation to economic, social and political systems. Works such as Video is\nTelevision? (1989) present dynamic collusions of television, cinema, film and video as cultural\nsignifiers.\n\nCritiquing the incursion of marketing and advertising strategies into politics, art and culture, his works\noften make reflexive use of mass media formats and contexts, including the World Wide Web,\nbillboards and public sites.\n\nMuntadas was born in 1942 in Barcelona, Spain. He studied architecture at the University of\nBarcelona and received an M.A. from Escuela Tecnica Superior Ingenieros Industriales, Barcelona.\nMuntadas moved to the United States in 1971. He has taught extensively, at the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego; Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux, France; Center for Advanced Visual Studies\nat Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.); and the San Francisco Art Institute, among other\ninstitutions. He is the recipient of numerous awards, including fellowships from the Guggenheim\nFoundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts,\nNew York State Council on the Arts, and Creative Artists Public Services (CAPS). He has been\nartist-in-residence at the Banff Center, Banff, Canada, and a Research Fellow at M.I.T.'s Center for\nAdvanced Visual Studies.

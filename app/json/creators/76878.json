He is best known for the discoveries of the wrecks of the RMS Titanic in 1985, the battleship Bismarck in 1989, and the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown in 1998. He discovered the wreck of John F. Kennedy's PT-109 in 2002 and visited Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, who saved its crew.\nDespite his long successes in shipwrecks, Ballard considers his most important discovery to be that of hydrothermal vents. Ballard has also established the JASON Project and leads ocean exploration on the research vessel E/V Nautilus.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:47:58.662541+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2963, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ballard"}], "uuid": "0d151f52-630e-4332-a845-41b9c5b228d7", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27645", "external_references": [{"id": 12587, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q312867"}, {"id": 12588, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "108612101"}, {"id": 12589, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83073944"}, {"id": 12590, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83073944"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T16:47:58.675596+10:00"}

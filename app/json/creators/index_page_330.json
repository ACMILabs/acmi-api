He focused on significant political, social and religious events, including the arrival of Greek ships at Victoria docks, celebrations and dances, protest marches, political meetings and religious occasions. Mr Agapitos' material comprises approximately three hours of footage and was shot on 16mm and 35mm film, which is preserved in our collection.\n\nBorn in Egypt to Greek parents, Tony gained valuable qualifications in filmmaking during his lifetime. He was involved in cinematography, specialising in documentary and news films, and also worked as a projectionist and technical director.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia in the late 1940s, he was employed from 1950-1953 as an instrument engineer with S.L.I. Lucas Australia. From 1953–1958 he was with Herschell’s Film Studio where he was involved in film maintenance and production. This included directing, editing, camera work and sound recording. Tony was active in the production of films for D24 Masonic Hospital and he also produced his own films. From 1958 he was at the State Film Centre, employed as a Biograph Projectionist travelling all around Victoria.\n\nSome of Tony’s personal footage was shown in a documentary about the history of Station and Princes Piers in Port Melbourne, as part of a restoration celebration in 2012. Princes Pier in particular played a key role in Australia’s wartime and multicultural history as the first landing in Australia for thousands of post war migrants. Tony’s films capture the pathos of the new arrivals; they are beautiful and emotionally powerful evocations of the experience.\n\nFragments of Tony’s work have also been used by participants in our Digital Storytelling workshops, bringing strong narrative drive to the participant’s personal stories, enabling them to communicate the complex emotional landscape of arrival in a strange country.",

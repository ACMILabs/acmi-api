In early 2010, David Bergstein's appointment as director for the British company was terminated and the company was placed in receivership. In October 2010 the US branch of the company was forced into bankruptcy, and in January 2012 a group of creditors filed a proposal with a federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles to take over and liquidate five companies formerly controlled by David Bergstein, among them Capitol Films.Capitol Films was involved in the production of some fifty films, among them A Good Man in Africa (1994), Death and the Maiden (1994), Wilde (1997), Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), Gosford Park (2001), Elvis Has Left the Building (2004), and Lucky Number Slevin (2006).", "biography_author": "Wikidata",

Familiar to Broadway, radio, movie, and early television audiences, this \"Apostle of Pep\" was regarded almost as a family member by millions because his top-rated radio shows revealed intimate stories and amusing anecdotes about his wife, Ida, and five daughters. Some of his hits include \"Makin' Whoopee\", \"Ida (Sweet as Apple Cider)\", \"If You Knew Susie\", \"Ma! He's Making Eyes at Me\", “Mandy”, \"My Baby Just Cares for Me”, \"Margie\", and \"How Ya Gonna Keep 'em Down on the Farm (After They've Seen Paree)?\" He also wrote a few songs, including \"Merrily We Roll Along\", the Merrie Melodies Warner Bros. cartoon theme.\nHis eye-rolling song-and-dance routines eventually led to his nickname \"Banjo Eyes\". In 1933, artist Frederick J. Garner caricatured Cantor with large round eyes resembling the drum-like pot of a banjo. Cantor's eyes became his trademark, often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical Banjo Eyes (1941).\nHis charity and humanitarian work was extensive, and he helped to develop March of Dimes; he is credited with coining its name. Cantor was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1956 for distinguished service to the film industry.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:44:06.895198+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1961, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Cantor"}], "uuid": "227b99f9-5a45-4822-a5fc-6439f74ab5f0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18542", "external_references": [{"id": 8498, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q350472"}, {"id": 8499, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "27180183"}, {"id": 8500, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83046955"}, {"id": 8501, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83046955"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:23:38.644884+10:00"}

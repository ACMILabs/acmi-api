His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, as well as the destructive capacity of human nature. He was a pioneer of Italian genre cinema, and is regarded as one of the most influential auteurs of the horror film genre.After providing special effects work and other assistance on productions like Hercules (1958) and Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959), Bava made his official feature directorial debut with the horror film Black Sunday, released in 1960. He went on to direct such films as The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Black Sabbath, The Whip and the Body (all released in 1963), Blood and Black Lace (1964), Planet of the Vampires (1965), Kill, Baby, Kill (1966), Danger: Diabolik (1968), A Bay of Blood (1971), Baron Blood (1972), Lisa and the Devil (1974) and Rabid Dogs (1974).\nAccording to the British Film Institute, \"Bava took a vital role in the creation of the modern horror film. If there was to be a Mount Rushmore-style monument dedicated to four directors whose work pioneered a new form of big screen chills and thrills, those giant faces etched in granite on the mountainside would be: Bava, Alfred Hitchcock, Georges Franju and Michael Powell.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:04:29.968188+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4613, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bava"}], "uuid": "03a1562a-b244-4f91-aa57-7c85d0db86c6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24430", "external_references": [{"id": 25185, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55438"}, {"id": 30113, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "311024422"}, {"id": 30114, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n84079480"}, {"id": 30115, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n84079480"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:43:58.485848+10:00"}, {"id": 29988, "name": "Leone International Film", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2355542, "title": "The House of exorcism = Lisa and the devil", "work_id": 87956, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:03:20.985926+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "20d1ee8f-f5fa-40f0-bc07-43b7675d2325", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "9980", "external_references": [{"id": 34216, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121337030"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:20:46.103932+10:00"}, {"id": 29983, "name": "Abel Ferrara", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1998472, "title": "The Funeral", "work_id": 93831, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992335, "title": "Angel of vengeance = Ms.45", "work_id": 87946, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2202086, "title": "Driller killer [DVD]", "work_id": 93805, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2326317, "title": "The Addiction", "work_id": 92466, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2136425, "title": "China girl", "work_id": 94308, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2358136, "title": "The King of New York", "work_id": 89522, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998469, "title": "Bad lieutenant (D)", "work_id": 93830, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875281, "title": "Dangerous game (Ferrara)", "work_id": 89426, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1951-07-19", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Abel Ferrara (born July 19, 1951) is an American filmmaker, known for the provocative and often controversial content in his movies and his use and redefinition of neo-noir imagery.

He was named as managing director of the firm's London office at age 28. Back in the United States, William Morris named him in 1974 as head of the international motion picture department, where he advised directors and writers on the steps they needed to take to get their ideas produced as films by the studios.He left William Morris to start his own production company and was hired by Warner Bros. In December 1980, Shapiro was promoted from vice president of worldwide production to president of theatrical film production.Shapiro resigned abruptly from Warner Bros. in July 1983, announcing that he had become an independent producer at the studio, based on his understanding of his agreement with the studio that he could become an independent producer \"whenever the timing seemed appropriate and beneficial to all concerned\". The studio's operating income had dropped $6 million from the previous year, only one of 1982's top ten box office hits – Chariots of Fire – was a Warner Bros. release, and the studio was tied for last with Columbia Pictures in domestic film rentals. He was very promptly replaced by Mark Rosenberg, a 35-year-old who had been with the studio for five years. Shapiro's departure was attributed in industry sources cited by The New York Times as due to poor financial results for the studio's films in the previous 18 months.Since leaving Warner Bros., Robert Shapiro Productions has produced films including Empire of the Sun, My Favorite Martian and Pee-wee's Big Adventure.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:51:43.823182+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5036, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shapiro_(filmmaker)"}], "uuid": "84c931d1-766a-4b65-9269-fd851fc93315", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27880", "external_references": [{"id": 25943, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7349716"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T00:46:33.537733+10:00"}, {"id": 29974, "name": "Niche Pictures", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2296607, "title": "Shadow of the vampire [DVD]", "work_id": 91933, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 907421, "title": "Love and death on Long Island", "work_id": 87941, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:28:39.402505+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f5c3d5a6-8643-411f-954d-07548de56efb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10957", "external_references": [{"id": 32783, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121035803"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:29:01.141214+10:00"}, {"id": 29971, "name": "Bruno Rubeo", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2464856, "title": "Picture Canada = Images du Canada", "work_id": 87939, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-14T10:20:52.933785+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c091cdf3-0be6-4daf-8c79-e930a6fd925f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16350", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-14T10:20:52.934116+10:00"}, {"id": 29970, "name": "Nous Auties", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2464855, "title": "Picture Canada = Images du Canada", "work_id": 87939, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-14T10:20:52.282380+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "0207144c-97e9-439a-b600-ee79bab575d6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "11020", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-14T10:20:52.282730+10:00"}, {"id": 29969, "name": "All About Us", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2464854, "title": "Picture Canada = Images du Canada", "work_id": 87939, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-14T10:20:51.632616+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "8a626b2a-ccb9-407e-8ba5-ad4489ac117e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "5124", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-14T10:20:51.632964+10:00"}]}

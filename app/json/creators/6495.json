One of Stephen's first works in 1975 was made with an audio synthesiser being fed into an oscilliscope that traced and layered the patterns of the sounds. He built his first `real' video synthesiser in 1979. In 1982 he established the highly influential post-production facility Heuristic Video and began his ten-year association as videomaker for the music group Severed Heads.\n\nIn providing technical support for numerous performance and video artists (including Nam June Paik and Charlotte Moorman) he has developed a range of techniques using the Fairlight CVI, the conjure computer graphics system and the Amiga computer.\n\nJones is particularly interested in organisation and self-regulating systems along with developing a visual language to communicate complex ideas.For the past twenty-five years Jones has been copnducting research into the relationship between neuroscience and the nature of consciousness, culminating in The Brain Project, a web site which has been in development since 1996.\n\nJones is the recipient of an Australia Council Fellowship, through the New Media Arts Fund. He now works as a consultant electronic engineer and builder of video studios.\n\nReferences:\nDead Eyes Opened , 1982-85, colour, sound, ? min\nHot with Fleas , 1986-87, colour, sound, ? min\nThe Brain Project , 1996, web site\nBibliography:\nMazurek, Amy An Interview with Stephen Jones and Tom Ellard, March 1994\nVideos by Severed Heads http://www.sevcom.com/video.htm", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:10:31.402471+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c557da05-6e45-4f4e-a2c1-17dece84b460", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110064", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}

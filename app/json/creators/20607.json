(; previously known as Nelvana Limited, sometimes known as Nelvana Animation and simply Nelvana, Nelvana Studios or Nelvana Communications) is a Canadian animation studio and entertainment company owned by Corus Entertainment. Founded in July 1971 by Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith, it was named after Nelvana of the Northern Lights, the first Canadian national superhero, who was created by Adrian Dingle. The company's production logo is a polar bear looking at Polaris, the North Star.\nThe company is based in Toronto, Ontario, and it maintains international offices in France, Ireland and Japan, as well as smaller offices in the top three cities in the U.S. Many of its films, shows and specials are based on licensed properties and literature, but original programming is also part of its roster. Although the company specializes in children's media, Nelvana has also co-produced adult animations like the first season of Clone High, John Callahan's Quads, Bob & Margaret, and Committed.\nNelvana International distributes Nickelodeon's Taina, and the first five seasons of The Fairly OddParents. As of 2001, its library comprised more than 1,650 cumulative half-hours of original programming.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:23:04.069077+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4772, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelvana"}], "uuid": "68bd6c97-7bc3-40f3-87ee-1a568e487b4f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4620", "external_references": [{"id": 26871, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q428457"}, {"id": 30503, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "135962760"}, {"id": 30504, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50001380"}, {"id": 30505, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50001380"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:28:08.627534+10:00"}

His work consists of five 'One Year Performances', done between the years of 1978 and 1986, and 'Earth', a thirteen-year performance that stretched from the end of 1986 to the end of 1999. Each of these Performances involves a particular vow, a particular contraint, and a particular mode of being. Each Performance is meticulously documented in a manner appropriate to its content.

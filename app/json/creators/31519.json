With a gruff demeanor and commanding presence, Scott became known for his portrayal of stern, but complex, authority figures such as prosecutor Claude Dancer in Anatomy of a Murder, General Buck Turgidson in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Herbert Bock in The Hospital, Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, Lt. Kinderman in The Exorcist III, and General George S. Patton in the biopic Patton, which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Described by The Guardian as \"a battler and an actor of rare courage\", his performances won him widespread recognition and numerous other accolades, including a Golden Globe, a Genie Award, and two Primetime Emmys.\nScott first distinguished himself as a stage actor in New York, both in Off-Broadway and Broadway productions. He earned the first of four Oscar nominations for only his second film role, in Anatomy of a Murder, and soon achieved screen stardom through a series of lead roles in films like The Hustler (1961), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and The Bible: In the Beginning (1966). Though he won the Best Actor Oscar for playing the titular role in Patton, he became the first actor to refuse the award, having warned the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences months in advance that he would do so on philosophical grounds if he won. Scott believed that every dramatic performance was unique and could not be compared to others.\nScott continued to maintain a prominent stage career even as his film stardom waned, and by the end of his career he had accrued five Tony nominations, including four for Best Actor in a Play, earning his final nomination for playing Matthew Harrison Brady in the 1996 Broadway revival of Inherit the Wind. He directed several of his own films and plays and often collaborated with his wives Colleen Dewhurst and Trish Van Devere.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:34:55.191289+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2109, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott"}], "uuid": "c58d87da-4baf-4c70-a3cf-b76cd938d6c7", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "19572", "external_references": [{"id": 9096, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q182450"}, {"id": 9097, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "61733056"}, {"id": 9098, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81098896"}, {"id": 9099, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81098896"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:29:34.365051+10:00"}

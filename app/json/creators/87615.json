These narratives take the forms of video, VR, sonic fiction, image, diagram and text, and are exposed as exhibitions, performances, theatrical projects and publications. Kim idiosyncratically synthesizes geopolitics, mythology, technology, and futuristic iconography, and retroactively collects the speculative time to infiltrate the present. Her interest in synthesis, hybridization, and the coexistence of heterogeneous time led to an interest in all kinds of intersections, transfers, transpositions, and interchanges of time, space, structure, and syntax.\"\n\nSource: Ayoung Kim, CV, accessed 18/10/2024, <http://ayoungkim.com/wp/cv>.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-03T22:35:23.162259+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "ac0678fd-8297-4b6f-9f55-02e4059f0ccf", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40753", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-03T22:35:23.162562+11:00"}

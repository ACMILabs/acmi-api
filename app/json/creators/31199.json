Taylor is best known for his comedic directorial work with Harold Lloyd and Mary Pickford, and also later worked with Laurel and Hardy. He was born in New York City.\nA notorious cinematic legend over the decades has suggested that Taylor's 1929 adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew had the screen credit \"additional dialogue by Sam Taylor\".  However, no extant prints of the film contain this credit, and there is no documentary evidence that it ever existed.\nTaylor directed seven feature films with Lloyd as star, second only to Fred C. Newmeyer (the two co-directed Lloyd in five features). He also directed Pickford in her first \"talkie\" feature with Coquette (1929), which garnered the latter an Academy Award. \nTaylor died at the age of 62 in Santa Monica, California.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:03:18.638023+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6165, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Taylor_(director)"}], "uuid": "a161031e-c406-45d9-87a8-15ada0dc18e8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28497", "external_references": [{"id": 50751, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q719427"}, {"id": 55753, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "37198878"}, {"id": 55754, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86075569"}, {"id": 55755, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86075569"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:03:23.703116+10:00"}

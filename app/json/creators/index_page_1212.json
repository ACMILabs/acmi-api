He is best known for his pioneering contributions to the ambient music and electronic genres and for his work in rock (particularly experimental rock, glam rock and art rock), artistic pop and minimalist drone music. A self-described \"non-musician\", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group before departing in 1973. He then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974) and began exploring a minimalist direction with the influential recordings Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term \"ambient music\".\nAlongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp (as part of the Fripp & Eno duo), Harmonia (for which he was described as a member in their 1976 concluding year), Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, and David Byrne. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, and including Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn.\nDating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, his installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:10:08.582398+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5714, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"}], "uuid": "edac254d-ee67-4642-b771-3f82061b297e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110345", "external_references": [{"id": 52056, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q569003"}, {"id": 54101, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "2638470"}, {"id": 54102, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85135915"}, {"id": 54103, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85135915"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:09:40.544813+11:00"}]}

He is best known for his pioneering contributions to the ambient music and electronic genres and for his work in rock (particularly experimental rock, glam rock and art rock), artistic pop and minimalist drone music. A self-described \"non-musician\", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures. In 2019, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group before departing in 1973. He then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with Here Come the Warm Jets (1974) and began exploring a minimalist direction with the influential recordings Discreet Music (1975) and Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978), coining the term \"ambient music\".\nAlongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp (as part of the Fripp & Eno duo), Harmonia (for which he was described as a member in their 1976 concluding year), Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, and David Byrne. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation No New York (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, and including Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn.\nDating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, his installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:10:08.582398+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5714, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno"}], "uuid": "edac254d-ee67-4642-b771-3f82061b297e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110345", "external_references": [{"id": 52056, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q569003"}, {"id": 54101, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "2638470"}, {"id": 54102, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85135915"}, {"id": 54103, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85135915"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:09:40.544813+11:00"}, {"id": 73146, "name": "Annie Lennox", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2748132, "title": "Finally destroy us", "work_id": 107935, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1954-12-25", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Ann Lennox  (born 25 December 1954) is a Scottish singer-songwriter, political activist and philanthropist. After achieving moderate success in the late 1970s as part of the new wave band the Tourists, she and fellow musician Dave Stewart went on to achieve international success in the 1980s as Eurythmics. Appearing in the 1983 music video for \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" with orange cropped hair and wearing a man's business suit, the BBC states, \"all eyes were on Annie Lennox, the singer whose powerful androgynous look defied the male gaze\". Subsequent hits with Eurythmics include \"There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)\", \"Love Is a Stranger\" and \"Here Comes the Rain Again\".\nLennox embarked on a solo career in 1992 with her debut album, Diva, which produced several hit singles including \"Why\" and \"Walking on Broken Glass\". The same year, she performed \"Love Song for a Vampire\" for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Her 1995 studio album, Medusa, includes cover versions of songs such as \"No More 'I Love You's'\" and \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\". To date, she has released six solo studio albums and a compilation album, The Annie Lennox Collection (2009). With eight Brit Awards, which includes being named Best British Female Artist a record six times, Lennox has been named the \"Brits Champion of Champions\". She has also collected four Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. In 2002, Lennox received a Billboard Century Award; the highest accolade from Billboard. In 2004, she received the Golden Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Into the West\", written for the soundtrack to the feature film The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\nLennox's vocal range is contralto. She has been named \"The Greatest White Soul Singer Alive\" by VH1 and one of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time by Rolling Stone. In 2012, she was rated No. 22 on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music. In June 2013 the Official Charts Company called her \"the most successful female British artist in UK music history\".

As part of a one-hour symphony of British Music, Lennox performed \"Little Bird\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London. At the 2015 Ivor Novello Awards, Lennox was made a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (The Ivors Academy), the first woman to receive the honour. Lennox and her Eurythmics partner Dave Stewart were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020, and the duo were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.In addition to her career as a musician, Lennox is also a political and social activist, raising money and awareness for HIV/AIDS as it affects women and children in Africa. She founded the Sing campaign in 2007 and founded a women's empowerment charity called The Circle in 2008. In 2011, Lennox was appointed an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II for her \"tireless charity campaigns and championing of humanitarian causes\".

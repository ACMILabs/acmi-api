Often performing in cinemas or art spaces using monologue and everyday technological tools, his live performances locate the user of platforms as a weary Everyman travelling through on-rail guided experiences. At present he is developing film and documentary projects and works from Studio 5 at the Boyd Hub, a complex managed by the City of Melbourneâ€™s Creative Spaces program.\n\nEmile received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from RMIT Media Arts Melbourne before relocating to Amsterdam in 2007 to commence an MFA degree at the Sandberg Institute. In 2012 he began a two year studio residency at the prestigious Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten, Amsterdam. Upon returning to Melbourne he undertook full-time practice-based doctoral research at Digital Ethnography Research Centre, Department of Media and Communication RMIT Melbourne, graduating in 2023. His research elaborated on the role of gesture and non-verbal communication within social media platforms and their relationship to the the first wave of lens-based Contemporary video art.\n\nRecent exhibitions, screenings and performances of his have included QUAI10 Belgium, NGV Triennale, LIMA Amsterdam and Artshouse Melbourne. His work is profiled in Australiana to Zeitgeist: an A to Z of Australian Contemporary Art 2017 published by Thames and Hudson and is included in Routledge Companion to Mobile Media Art 2020.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2024-01-17T04:01:45.176036+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "6e4fbc34-7b0a-4a79-810b-e16693a92671", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40483", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2024-01-17T04:01:45.176249+11:00"}

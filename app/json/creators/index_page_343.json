Now his vast hoard is up for sale.\nSale of cinema collectibles spotlights remarkable child magician, tap dancer and hoarder\n\nOn Sunday 22 April, in suburban Melbourne, the family of the late Vincent McMurray will sell his huge collection of cinema memorabilia. His daughter Fran Steffanoni hopes to attract collectors who will understand the value of his 8mm, 9.5mm, 16mm and 35mm projectors and parts, and his large quantity of slide projectors for stage and screen use.\n\nThat is a pretty local announcement. But the flyer from the Cinema Pioneers suggested people could contact Fran Steffanoni, and so I did. That is how I found the wonderful world of the McMurray family.\n\n‘He was a character,’ Fran said, ‘a hoarder and a collector. He was just an awesome man who collected a lot of shit and if he wasn’t dead I would kill him.\n\n‘I was a school teacher and I had to give up work to sort out all the stuff for Mum. It was a grieving process and it kept me close to him.’\n\nHe started to hoard in the 1960's when the  kids were very young. Fran remembers throwing out an empty chocolate box, which he dug out of the rubbish and brought into the lounge room. ‘Who threw this out?’ he said. ‘Why did you throw it out? It’s a perfectly good box. I could put nuts and bolts in it.’\n\nThe only way the family could throw anything away was to screw it up in newspaper, disguise it and then hide it in the bottom of the bin.\n\nAside from this one giant eccentricity, he was a very loveable man, kind and humorous and optimistic. His father ran a travelling vaudeville show, and performed as a tap dancer and Adrian the Magician, travelling between Melbourne and Adelaide. Vincent was born in 1934 and went on the road with him when he was only a few years old. He hardly went to school and only learned to read and write by puzzling out the connection between images and word balloons in comics.\n\nHis father was also a photographer. He had a booth at Luna Park and at the Zoo, where he posed customers beside the lion cage, concentrating so fiercely he didn't notice when a lion escaped and sat peacefully next to him. Eventually he was killed as a passenger in a head on collision on those lonely border roads.\n\nOnce Vincent settled down and bought a house, he was home with a vengeance.  Each Christmas he would tap dance on the lounge room floor, and sing mournful songs like My Dog Shep and The Boy that Santa Forgot, while he and the littlies wept. They loved it, of course, and so did he as tears streamed down his face. Fran is proud that the men in her family could cry in public.\n\nAs she remembers, ‘We were a pretty poor family and didn’t have holidays but we would get up very early in the morning and travel through the Victorian countryside looking for anything to do with horses. Dad would go and knock on the doors of houses so he could look in old sheds. He would come back to the car and say, “Irene, come inside and have a cup of tea” and the old lady would give us scones and Dad would organise to buy a horse-drawn vehicle.\n\nOne day, ‘He goes up to some sheds and comes racing out with his arms going backwards and forwards and he is running like crazy. He was shouting, “Put your heads down” and jumped into the car and we heard a shotgun firing.’\n\nHe put his growing pile of carts and carriages into the back yard, and there they stayed until his dying day. He was very good at swapping, and eventually traded a collection of clocks and four piano box buggies for an enclosed and restored brougham, which he re-upholstered to take Fran to her wedding.\n\nBut his collection grew and grew. He filled the two car garage. He built a new bedroom on the back and then filled that. Eventually he had nine sheds in the back yard, and resorted to filling all his own clapped out and hoarded cars so they sat in a colony at the front of the house.\n\nThen Fran figured her parents needed a computer, partly because her mother was a typist. Instead, Vincent took it over and discovered eBay. From then on, he was swapping and buying on an international scale. Fran bought Irene her own computer.\n\nSeven years ago he developed lung cancer, was treated and had an operation which didn’t seem to work. The doctors gave him at most a couple of months to live. He demanded more treatment, they said it would kill him and he had the pleasure of shouting at surgeons, pointing out he was going to die anyway. They surrendered and he lived another four years.\n\nWhen he went in for radiotherapy his kids would gather around and sing the old vaudeville songs (not the really sad ones) while his wife Irene stood in the corridor, too embarrassed to stay.\n\nAs technology moved on and time took its toll on old stuff, the junk became a collection and became more valuable. Vincent was careful and ordered, so he had some unknown rules of storage, and kept everything meticulously protected from decay. Once he died, they had an enormous amount of stuff which could be turned into cash, given that Irene didn’t have any money on account of her husband kept buying things although she loved him a lot because he was otherwise the best of men.\n\nHe bought old cans of film which sometimes had random bits from other productions, which is why Fran discovered his (unused) pornography collection. A local porn producer bought what seems to be the earliest skinflick made in Australia.\n\nWhen they opened the doors to the nine sheds they were confronted with a wall of boxes. It was not possible to step into each room, or know what was inside. Even shutting the doors was hard because the contents bulged out. Deep in one of the sheds they found the brougham, trapped for decades.\n\nOne of Fran’s three brothers was determined to throw it all into skips, and they did indeed dispose of the crappiest material, like the chocolate boxes he intercepted on the way to the bin. But Fran is a practical and interesting woman in her own right - an art teacher in primary school who insisted her kids learnt practical technique and was enchanted when they recognised they could draw something that recreated what they saw.\n\nShe devised an order of disposal, which became a three year journey so overwhelming she sometimes broke down and cried. They organised a sale at a country showgrounds with a professional auctioneer for the horse stuff, which was definitely valuable. Fran figured that would create some space so they could manoever the rest, but discovered that Vincent had packed the interiors and underside of the carts as well. They were wedged solid next to each other. It took months to simply pull them out and onto trucks.\n\nThey dragged everything out of the long shed which extended down the side of the house and into the back yard, and discovered that Vincent had built it with a lot of asbestos. All the money from the auction went to dispose of it.\n\nThere was an obvious mad side to Vincent, though he was also a wise collector. Film footage is said to be heading for the National Film and Sound Archive and ACMI went through the material before the sale. The museum acquired what it calls ‘quite a few boxes of material’ which is still being catalogued, and includes film and objects.\n\nThe family had an argument over Vincent’s epitaph. He insisted on the words, ‘Here today and still here tomorrow’ which is a backhanded tribute to his religion but can be applied to the impact of his strange collections.\n\nHis family expressed their love, and then added another two words.\n\nDance on.\n\nFIRST PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY 19 APRIL, 2018\"", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2024-04-17T04:06:30.141176+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c4bd99e3-62c6-4cc6-8aba-f7deafcb662b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38925", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2024-04-17T04:06:30.141425+10:00"}, {"id": 82093, "name": "Kirsty Sword Gusmão", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2058106, "title": "[Kirsty Sword Gusmão Film Collection]", "work_id": 114452, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T10:52:23.183817+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "bdb88739-48e7-4feb-a652-bffd750bc49b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38645", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 82092, "name": "Douglas Wilson", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2051586, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movies: Reel 5]", "work_id": 117734, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2051570, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movies: Reel 1]", "work_id": 114446, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2051583, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movies: Reel 4]", "work_id": 114449, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2051574, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movies: Reel 2]", "work_id": 114447, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2051588, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movie Collection]", "work_id": 119152, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2051604, "title": "[Douglas Wilson Home Movies: Reel 3]", "work_id": 114448, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T10:01:13.164703+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "47eef15b-7aed-49e7-b351-e0bb99b3d357", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38881", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 82091, "name": "Ditmar", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686154, "title": "16mm projector", "work_id": 99430, "role": "manufacturer", "role_id": 627, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1840", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T11:19:48.762714+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "0d3e9b8d-53c9-42f0-af5c-416ef5ce745f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39173", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:14:22.633475+11:00"}, {"id": 82090, "name": "Jesse Taylorsmith", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686419, "title": "[Remix: Transport]", "work_id": 119318, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2660417, "title": "Hollywood Costume.

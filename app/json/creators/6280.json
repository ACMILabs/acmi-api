The ultimate voyeur, Auder observes and edits with an eye that is at once ironic and poignant.\n\nCapturing the stories and dramas of friends, family, and a `cast' of artists, writers, performers, and downtown luminaries, from Andy Warhol to his wife, Cindy Sherman, he achieves a startling sense of intimacy. Auder's work often integrates rescanned television images as part of the everyday landscape of `media reality.' With his rich accumulation of recorded detail, his distracted soundtracks of overheard conversations, and his obsessive chronicling of a specific cultural milieu, Auder evokes Proust by way of Bukowski. Transcending documentary, Auder's video journals resonate with an idiosyncratic poetry.\n\nMichel Auder was born in Soissons, France in 1944. Auder's video work has been featured in exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Transmission Gallery, Glasgow; AC Project Room, New York; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; White Columns, New York; and Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris. He is represented in the collections of Musee d'art Contemporain, Montreal; Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, and the Israel Museum, Jerusalem. Auder lives in New York.

He is the co-writer of the Star Wars films The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), The Force Awakens (2015), and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). He also co-wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and The Bodyguard (1992), and is the writer-director of Body Heat (1981), The Big Chill (1983), Silverado (1985), The Accidental Tourist (1988), and Dreamcatcher (2003). He is known for updating old Hollywood genres—film noir, science-fiction, westerns—in a classical dramatic style with quick-witted dialogue, but dealing with contemporary social themes. As a director, he has made various personal films that examine characters and generations.\n\nKasdan has been nominated for four Academy Awards: as a producer for Best Picture nominee The Accidental Tourist, for which he was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, and for Best Original Screenplay for both The Big Chill and Grand Canyon (1991). He has often collaborated with his wife, Meg Kasdan, his brother, Mark Kasdan, and his two sons: Jonathan Kasdan and Jake Kasdan. He frequently casts Kevin Kline and William Hurt in his films.; 17/08/2023", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-05T14:02:36.818285+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2554, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan"}], "uuid": "4d86ce1f-1430-414c-84b8-a1da4857b619", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23586", "external_references": [{"id": 25543, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q240872"}, {"id": 29875, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "7508894"}, {"id": 29876, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81100123"}, {"id": 29877, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81100123"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T14:02:36.818508+11:00"}

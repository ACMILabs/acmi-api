He has a long and distinguished career that places him among the most accomplished post-New Wave French film directors.\nTéchiné belongs to a second generation of French film critics associated with Cahiers du cinéma who followed  François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and others from criticism into filmmaking. He is noted for his elegant and emotionally charged films that often delve into the complexities of emotions and the human condition. One of Téchiné's trademarks is the lyrical examination of human relations in a sensitive but unsentimental way, as can be seen in his most acclaimed films: My Favorite Season (1993) and Wild Reeds (1994).\nIn his films he addresses various themes related to morality and the development of modern society, such as homosexuality, divorce, adultery, family breakdown, prostitution, crime, drug addiction or AIDS.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:48:45.119122+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1638, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_T%C3%A9chin%C3%A9"}], "uuid": "e0e8eef9-5f68-4bf3-a095-06219ebba2f2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "15117", "external_references": [{"id": 7156, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q523144"}, {"id": 7157, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "86941868"}, {"id": 7158, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n80077980"}, {"id": 7159, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n80077980"}], "date_modified": "2024-10-23T03:45:47.791166+11:00"}

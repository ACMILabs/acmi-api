It is aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement. The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7 million, comprising soldiers, officers, and adherents who are collectively known as Salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their \"physical and spiritual needs\". It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless, and disaster relief and humanitarian aid to developing countries.\nThe theology of the Salvation Army derives from Methodism, although it differs in institution and practice. A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as \"lieutenant\" or \"major\". It does not celebrate the rites of Baptism and Holy Communion. The Army's doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyanâ€“Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army's purposes are \"the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole\".The Army was founded in 1865 as the \"East London Christian Mission\" in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine. It can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first general and introducing the military structure which it has retained as a matter of tradition. Its highest priority is its Christian principles. As of 2023 the international leader of The Salvation Army and chief executive officer (CEO) is General Lyndon Buckingham.\nThe Salvation Army is the largest non-government provider of social services in the United States and one of the largest in the world, with expenditures including operating costs of US$3.6 billion in 2022, assisting more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to funding feeding centers, homeless shelters, rehabilitation and community centres, and disaster relief, the organisation establishes refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest non-governmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the fourth largest charity in the United States, with private donations in excess of US$2 billion in 2022. It is a member of the American organisation Christian Churches Together.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:02:17.688440+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6164, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army"}], "uuid": "a913648e-a409-468f-add2-496c1394ffa5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12248", "external_references": [{"id": 51656, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q188307"}, {"id": 55750, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "153030282"}, {"id": 55751, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79046615"}, {"id": 55752, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79046615"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:02:21.769536+10:00"}

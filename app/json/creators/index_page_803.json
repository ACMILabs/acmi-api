His film credits include the Australian film The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), among others, and more recently appeared in TV series Cleverman (2016) and Preppers (2021).\nHe spent many decades in and out of prison and as a heroin addict, which he ascribed largely to trauma that he experienced as a child, as one of the Stolen Generations. In later life he became a mentor for Aboriginal youth in the prison system along with musician Archie Roach, and was revered as an elder. As a gay man, Charles was considered a gay icon and role model for LGBTQI+ Indigenous youth.\nAmong other awards and honours, he was Victorian Senior Australian of the Year in 2015, and Male Elder of the Year in the 2022 National NAIDOC Week Awards.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:54:21.970604+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5886, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Charles"}], "uuid": "9154478b-eb6b-443a-b903-5ed50db818e1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34952", "external_references": [{"id": 32879, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q16106209"}, {"id": 54728, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "7449150749023616420007"}, {"id": 54729, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "viaf-7449150749023616420007"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:11:37.098268+11:00"}, {"id": 77481, "name": "Jaylene Riley", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2614500, "title": "Blackfellas", "work_id": 83788, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T12:57:30.221780+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "01a0983e-4b32-41e5-8bd4-a80e63f1d376", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34951", "external_references": [{"id": 37587, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121078936"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:11:35.917468+11:00"}, {"id": 77480, "name": "David Ngoombujarra", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2614499, "title": "Blackfellas", "work_id": 83788, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "27 JUN 1967", "date_of_death": "17 JUL 2011", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "biography": "David Ngoombujarra (27 June 1967 – 17 July 2011) was an Indigenous Australian actor of the Yamatji people.

He is best remembered for his work in the thriller film genre, having directed The Wages of Fear (1953) and Les Diaboliques (1955), which are critically recognized as among the greatest films of the 1950s. He also directed documentary films, including The Mystery of Picasso (1956), which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.\nClouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to Paris. He was later hired by producer Adolphe Osso to work in Berlin, writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from UFA studio in Nazi Germany due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting tuberculosis. Upon recovering, he found work in Nazi-occupied France as a screenwriter for the German-owned company Continental Films. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular. His second film Le Corbeau drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France, and he was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, he was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.\nAfter the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques; both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, his wife Véra died of a heart attack, and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. \nClouzot is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the Golden Bear at Berlin, the Golden Lion at Venice, and the Palme d'Or at Cannes (the other two being Robert Altman and Michelangelo Antonioni). Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. He wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-15T11:09:35.195354+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2216, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri-Georges_Clouzot"}], "uuid": "e794ff8c-4758-4989-8464-9a77d2d12a77", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20473", "external_references": [{"id": 9521, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55384"}, {"id": 9522, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "100304643"}, {"id": 9523, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87147701"}, {"id": 9524, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87147701"}], "date_modified": "2025-05-22T22:51:47.222606+10:00"}, {"id": 77476, "name": "Colin Thiele", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2788954, "title": "Colin Thiele", "work_id": 83768, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:40:22.181909+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "dbc2df25-0111-4044-b16d-febd03f8b816", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "195", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-14T19:47:48.399884+11:00"}, {"id": 77475, "name": "Legal Aid Commission of Victoria", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 868731, "title": "The Letter: a film about legal rights. -

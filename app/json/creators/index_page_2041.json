Daughter of director, James Benning, She began making video tapes at the age of fifteen, using a Fisher-Price PXL 2000 Pixelvision toy camera. Her early works were made in the privacy of her childhood bedroom, sometimes while skipping school. The quality of Benning's work is founded on her intense relationship with the camera, as both confidant and witness. She manages to evoke a sense of intimacy that goes beyond the revelations of a teenage diary. Her inventive use toys, of scrawled and handwritten text from posters and diary entries, complement the often terse expressions and associations of an identity that allows us to glimpse its longings and complexities. Her work manages to combine playful seduction with painful honesty. It emerges from a place half-innocent and half-adult, with all the honesty, humor, and real desperation of a personality trapped and uncomfortable, just coming to self-awareness.\n\nBenning received a Masters of Fine Arts from Milton Avery School of the Arts at Bard College in 1997. She has participated in museum exhibitions and festivals worldwide (Germany, Korea, France, Columbia, New York and California to name just a few places), has won numerous grants and awards, and has presented lectures and artists workshops. Her works can be found in various museum's permanent collections, and she has been featured in numerous broadcast and print publications. In an article for Art Journal in 1995, Bill Horrigan, Media Arts Curator at the Wexner Center for the Arts, described Benning as one of the handful of North American independent video producers of the past 10 years to have attracted sustained critical notice outside the circuits typically open to noncommercially minded media artists.\nReferences:\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 1, 35:00 min\nA New Year, 1989, 06:00 b/w;\nLiving Inside, 1989, 06:00 b/w;\nIf Every Girl Had A Diary, 1990 06:00 b/w;\nJollies, 1990, 11:00 b/w;\nMe And Rubyfruit, 1990, 06:00 b/w;\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 2, 49:00 min\nA Place Called Lovely, 1991, 14:00 b/w;\nGirl Power, 1992, 15:00 b/w;\nIt Wasn't Love, 1992, 20:00 b/w;\nVideoworks of Sadie Benning: Volume 3, 70:00 min\nGerman Song, 1995, 05:00 b/w;\nThe Judy Spots, 1995, 15:00 b/w;\nFlat is Beautiful, 1998, 50:00 b/w;\nFlat is Beautiful, 1998, (included in Video works V.3), 50:00 mins\nBibliography:\nMorris, Garry Behind the Mask: Sadie Benning's Pixel Pleasures, Bright Lights Film Journal, April 1999 Issue 24.\nFilm and Video Umbrella The Fisher-price Pixelvision camera (notes from a touring exhibition)\nOwen, Wendy Net Dezigns - Web Designs, and HTML Document Development, 1997\nHolmlund, Chris & Fuchs, Cynthia Between the Sheets, in the Streets : Queer, Lesbian, and Gay Documentary (Visible Evidence, Vol 1)\nHolmlund, Chris When Autobiography Meets Ethnography and Girl Meets Girl: The \"Dyke Docs\" of Sadie Benning and Su Friedrich Univ of Minnesota, Chapter 7\nChang, Chris Up in Sadie's Room, Film Comment V29, No.2 (March-April, 1993)\nSpiro, Ellen, Shooting Star: Teenage Video Maker Sadie Benning Attracts a Youthful Audience Advocate, No. 573 (March 26, 1991)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:59:04.525984+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "1db14d23-536c-4402-9dfd-574fe20bfe53", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110024", "external_references": [{"id": 26150, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q448193"}], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6503, "name": "Paul Western-Pittard", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2355965, "title": "[Walk cycle]", "work_id": 108014, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2355610, "title": "Fish!", "work_id": 108019, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2355608, "title": "Fish!", "work_id": 108019, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:03:54.834660+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "7d588065-1a4f-4651-a22e-4ad0929c2e9c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110014", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6502, "name": "Michael Buckley", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2374066, "title": "The Greatest Art Movement: Transporting Art: the Story of Melbourne's Art Trams", "work_id": 84738, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2355952, "title": "[Walk cycle]", "work_id": 108014, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2355631, "title": "Forever young", "work_id": 108018, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2355628, "title": "Forever young", "work_id": 108018, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2355624, "title": "Forever young", "work_id": 108018, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353061, "title": "The Happy prince", "work_id": 110296, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2335220, "title": "The Business of Welfare", "work_id": 78340, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2290266, "title": "Two songs by Dougie Young.

One of Stephen's first works in 1975 was made with an audio synthesiser being fed into an oscilliscope that traced and layered the patterns of the sounds. He built his first `real' video synthesiser in 1979. In 1982 he established the highly influential post-production facility Heuristic Video and began his ten-year association as videomaker for the music group Severed Heads.\n\nIn providing technical support for numerous performance and video artists (including Nam June Paik and Charlotte Moorman) he has developed a range of techniques using the Fairlight CVI, the conjure computer graphics system and the Amiga computer.\n\nJones is particularly interested in organisation and self-regulating systems along with developing a visual language to communicate complex ideas.For the past twenty-five years Jones has been copnducting research into the relationship between neuroscience and the nature of consciousness, culminating in The Brain Project, a web site which has been in development since 1996.\n\nJones is the recipient of an Australia Council Fellowship, through the New Media Arts Fund.

O'Brien (for which the latter won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects); his first color film, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958); and Jason and the Argonauts (1963), which featured a sword fight with seven skeleton warriors. His last film was Clash of the Titans (1981), after which he retired.\nIn 1960, Harryhausen moved to the United Kingdom and became a dual American-British citizen. He lived in London until his death in 2013. During his life, his innovative style of special effects in films inspired numerous filmmakers. In November 2016 the BFI compiled a list of those present-day filmmakers who claim to have been inspired by Harryhausen, including Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Joe Dante, Tim Burton, Nick Park, James Cameron, and Guillermo del Toro.

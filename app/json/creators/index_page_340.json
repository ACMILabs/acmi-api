He focused on significant political, social and religious events, including the arrival of Greek ships at Victoria docks, celebrations and dances, protest marches, political meetings and religious occasions. Mr Agapitos' material comprises approximately three hours of footage and was shot on 16mm and 35mm film, which is preserved in our collection.\n\nBorn in Egypt to Greek parents, Tony gained valuable qualifications in filmmaking during his lifetime. He was involved in cinematography, specialising in documentary and news films, and also worked as a projectionist and technical director.\n\nAfter arriving in Australia in the late 1940s, he was employed from 1950-1953 as an instrument engineer with S.L.I. Lucas Australia. From 1953–1958 he was with Herschell’s Film Studio where he was involved in film maintenance and production. This included directing, editing, camera work and sound recording. Tony was active in the production of films for D24 Masonic Hospital and he also produced his own films. From 1958 he was at the State Film Centre, employed as a Biograph Projectionist travelling all around Victoria.\n\nSome of Tony’s personal footage was shown in a documentary about the history of Station and Princes Piers in Port Melbourne, as part of a restoration celebration in 2012. Princes Pier in particular played a key role in Australia’s wartime and multicultural history as the first landing in Australia for thousands of post war migrants. Tony’s films capture the pathos of the new arrivals; they are beautiful and emotionally powerful evocations of the experience.\n\nFragments of Tony’s work have also been used by participants in our Digital Storytelling workshops, bringing strong narrative drive to the participant’s personal stories, enabling them to communicate the complex emotional landscape of arrival in a strange country.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:43:37.729480+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "e15e33f2-a011-4f09-9947-876f5dc25685", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111974", "external_references": [{"id": 41416, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121034256"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:43:37.729776+11:00"}, {"id": 82125, "name": "Warren Burt", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2632954, "title": "Warren Burt", "work_id": 114539, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Beginning in 1973 in San Diego, I began extending my work in\ngenerating sound with electronic algorithmic processes into the visual realm. In San Diego, a Serge analog sound synthesizer was used in conjunction with a Beck video encoder box to produce works such as\n\"Dying Song,\" which explored slowly changing basic shapes derived from changing aspects of the horizontal and vertical video sync frequencies.\n\nOn moving to Melbourne in 1975, I began working with Richard\nMonkhouse's EMS Spectre Video synthesizer. This allowed\ntreatment of camera made video (as in \"Nighthawk Part 3 - Bittern\"\n(1976)), and also generation of abstract imagery. (\"Nocturnals\n(1977)). Again, these works were generated by algorithmic\nprocesses, which I interacted with in real time to produce a final\nproduct.\n\nThe Spectre and the Rutt-Etra Video Synthesizers were used in\n1978-79 to make \"Moods\", a 2 hour set of 15 works. Many different\ntechniques were used in this work, from collage (\"for Ives and Jobim\")\nto using analog sound synthesis techniques to generate images (\"after\nMonk\") to using the Rutt-Etra to distort performers faces in real time, and having the performers use these distortions as a score for vocal performance. (\"3 Views\").\n\nIn 1986 at International Synergy Institute in Los Angeles, I used a\nFairlight Video Synthesizer to make \"Meditations\", a 2 hour set of 24\nfive minute pieces. Again, the method used in making these was to set\nup an automated process, and then interact with it in real time, making abstract images that I felt I could move with, and that created an environment I wanted to live in. Video feedback processes were also used here, but I tried to avoid the cliches of video feedback.\n(\"Meditation 10\" and \"Meditation 13\").\n\nFrom 1992-1996, I worked with Jim Binkley's real-time computer\ngraphics animation program PIP, which put out the now obsolete\nEGA graphics. PIP was an offshoot of Binkley's algorithmic RAVEL\nmusic language, and had many interesting process generation features\nin it, such as Iterated Function Systems routines, which generated\nchaos graphics. In 1996, I performed \"2 Solo Interactions\" with this\npiece- a live interaction with the computer for voice and movement,\nwhere my movements controlled both the video and sound produced,\nat the Canberra School of Art and the Australian Centre for the Arts\nand Technology.\n\nIn all this work, my aesthetic has been one of setting up a process and then learning/devising ways to interact with that process. The aim of my work has been primarily exploratory, rather than primarily\nnarrative or expressive. I am hopefully using this work to find out\nwhat I don't know, and to change myself, rather than using it to simply express what I already know. In some of the works, my aim was for a common process to generate both image and sound. In other\nworks, parallel processes, were used. And in some works, sound and\nimage were only related by happening at the same time. The\nexploration of all sorts of relationships between sound, image and language has been very important for me. I stand for diversity, and not the following of one style or another.\n\n\nVIDEO and FILM works\n\"A Guided Tour to the Caves of Uranus\" (1974)\n\ncolor NTSC U-matic video and sound synthesis (23 mins)\nperformed: University of California, San Diego, 1975; Immaculate Heart College, Los Angeles 1975; Clifton Hill Community Music Centre, Melbourne, 1976.\nMade with Serge Analog Synth, Beck Video Encoder at Center for Music Experiment, University of California, San Diego.\nVery slowly changing video - a live improvisation of both sound and image - the essence of what it meant to be a Young California Minimal Artist (YCMA).\n\n\"Very Smart Microbes\" (1975)\n\nColor NTSC U-matic video and sound synthesis (34 mins)\nperformed: University of California, San Diego 1975, Clifton Hill Community Music Centre, Melbourne 1976\nMade with: Serge Analog Synth, Beck Video Encoder, at Centre for Music Experiment, University of California, San Diego\nIn three sections, this work deals with surfing electronic processes and observing the results, which are slowly changing and mesmeric.\n\n\"Fatty Acid: The School of Cage\" (1975)\n\nB+W NTSC U-matic documentary video tape (45 mins) in collaboration with Ronald Al Robboy and David Dunn\nperformed: University of California, San Diego, 1975;\ndocuments from tape published Ear Magazine, New York, 1977.\nMade with: B+W video camera, U-Matic recorder at Center for Music Experiment, University of California, San Diego.

This is a documentation of our expose of the Rockefeller led machinations in the US avant-garde music scene in the 1930s and their horrifying consequences in the 1950s. Made of course, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\"Recital\" (1975)\n\nB+W NTSC U-Matic video performance - voice and piano accordion (15 mins)\nin collaboration with Jennifer Kotter, camera;\nperformed: 1987, Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne, WB\nMade with: B+W camera, 3/4 inch deck, at Center for Music Experiment, University of California, San Diego\nA score exists in my archives.

A very abstract image which then moves in sync with the timpani being played. The in-joke here was that John McCaughey's nickname at the time was \"The Shadow\", from his ability to suddenly appear behind someone as if he had been invisible. So in this tape, we made him visually invisible, but sonically still audible.\n\n\"Two Documentaries on Bill Fontana's Work\" (1978)\n\nB+W PAL video tape (20 mins each)\nperformed: National Gallery, Melb. 1978\nMade with B+W video deck, (dubbed to 3/4 inch PAL U-Matic) at Gundagai, NSW, and on the Frankston Railway Line, Melbourne.\nThey were shown at the NGV in conjunction with a big sound sculpture show of Bill Fontana's in 1978. I remember liking the Frankston line video a lot, which, after showing Bill and his assistants setting up microphones and radio transmitters along the railway line, consisted of about 15 minutes of just shooting the inside of a train carriage while it was moving.\n\n\"Danger Dance\" (1978)\n\nPAL U-matic color video (6 minutes) collaboration with Eva Karczag.\nTape performed Clifton Hill Community Music Centre, 1978, 1979, and sometime in Sydney.\nMade with Super 8 film, slowed down and transferred to video.

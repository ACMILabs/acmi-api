Before this collaboration, both worked with data in a new media framework.  Since 1991, Waterson's interactive installations have dealt with ideas of 'invisible' technology. Her most recent work, a gesture-controlled video tool (developed during a Waikato Artist Residency Program, New Zealand), explored cultural gestures and mapping. Richards has written and directed the CD-ROM Elementia, a set of 11 maps created by fictional cartographers. She was multimedia producer on the large-scale virtual mapping project TimeMap, distributed for the Museum of Sydney in collaboration with the Archaeological Computing Lab, University of Sydney. Life After Wartime (a collaboration with Ross Gibson) is a suite of new media that rework archival forensic images, texts and sounds using different codes.\n\nTaken from PROOF exhibition 2004.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-14T10:54:22.147171+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "732ada0d-1a86-47f3-9037-c2024ad48d73", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1232", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-14T10:54:22.147476+10:00"}

Based in Sydney, its performance season at the Sydney Opera House accompanied by the Opera Australia Orchestra runs for approximately eight months of the year, with the remainder of its time spent at the Arts Centre Melbourne, where it is accompanied by Orchestra Victoria. In 2004, the company gave 226 performances in its subscription seasons in Sydney and Melbourne, attended by more than 294,000 people.It is funded by government grants, corporate sponsorship, private philanthropy, and ticket sales. The proportion of its revenue from ticket sales is considerably higher than that of most companies, approximately 75 per cent. The company is perhaps best known internationally for its association with Dame Joan Sutherland, for Baz Luhrmann's production of Puccini's La boh√®me in the early 1990s and more recently, for, apart from performances inside the opera house, large scale outdoor performances on Sydney Harbour.\nMany thousands of Australians also experience the company's work through television, radio, video, compact disc, DVD, and the annual free performance of opera in the Domain in Sydney. The company also performs in an annual outdoor event at Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, where since 2012 operas such as La traviata, Madama Butterfly, Turandot, Aida and Carmen have played.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:37:21.892111+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6075, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Australia"}], "uuid": "6abb559d-7fc3-4dbc-9610-a3b359cdc198", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4745", "external_references": [{"id": 42593, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2916790"}, {"id": 55399, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "131870182"}, {"id": 55400, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2003022479"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:37:24.659673+10:00"}

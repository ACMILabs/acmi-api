His works orchestrate a field of relations between people and things, light and space, video and time, where the encounter between audience and artwork reveals a dialectical interplay of viewer and viewed. His approach is experimental, playfully testing expectations of quotidian occurrences and ordinary experience.\n\nRecent exhibitions include: ​‘Spacemakers and Roomshakers’, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney (2018); ​‘Collective Visions: 130 Years’, Bendigo Art Gallery, Bendigo (2017); ​‘Red Green Blue: A History of Australian Video Art, Griffith University, Queensland Collage of Art, Brisbane (2017); ​‘Electric Light’, Anna Schwartz Gallery, Melbourne (2016); ​‘Electric Light (facts/​figures), Bus Projects, Mel­bourne (2017); ​‘These Constructs’, Anna Schwartz Gallery, Melbourne (2014); ​‘Camera Ready Actions’, Young Projects, Los Angeles (2014).\n\nVon Sturmer represented Australia at the 52nd Venice Biennale in 2007 and was the winner of the Melbourne Prize for Urban Sculpture in 2017.\n\n[source: Anna Schwartz Gallery; https://annaschwartzgallery.com/artist/daniel-von-sturmer; last accessed: 04 February 2021]", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:55:43.329581+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "67fafcf3-ed63-4221-a5ba-7423f64f6e2a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2050", "external_references": [{"id": 51078, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121361147"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:55:43.329874+11:00"}

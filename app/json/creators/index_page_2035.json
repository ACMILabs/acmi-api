Through metaphor, provocation and association, Kobland often explores the historical meaning, critical context, and received notions of a particular site or place. He writes, \"I 'dream' a place .... The work is principally about reflecting on the meaning of a site; historically, psychically, and physically. It?s about the saturation of place. The place in our heads and the place on the ground.\" Kobland is currently working on a new film/video work, Who Writes Remains, and a collaborative feature film project with The Wooster Group.\n\nKen Kobland was born in New York in 1946. He studied at Columbia University School of Architecture and Union College. Since 1975 he has worked with the Wooster Group. Kobland has received awards and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; the New York Foundation on the Arts; the D.A.A.D. Berliner Kunstprogramm; the International Center for Video Creation in Montbeliard, France; the Jerome Foundation; and the American Film Institute. His work has been included in film and video festivals in Geneva, Berlin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney, Budapest, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Bangkok, and has been screened at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Biennial; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Arsenal, Berlin. Kobland?s work has also been screened nationally on Public Television and in Europe. He lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nFlaubert Dreams of Travel But The Illness of His Mother Prevents It, 1986, 20 min, color, sound\nBerlin/nilreB: Tourist Journal (Die da druben und Das da unter

"date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Bringing a painterly, poetic aesthetic to his distinctive image-processing techniques, Shalom Gorewitz uses the electronic medium to create introspective visions, transforming recorded reality through an expressionistic manipulation of images and sound. Pulsating with vibrant color and kinetic motion, his richly textured, densely layered collages evoke both \"apocalypse and rapture,\" as he confronts the political conflicts, personal losses, and spiritual rituals of contemporary life.\n\nNaturalistic images recorded with a consumer quality camcorder are transformed by Gorewitz into evocative dreams or nightmares, as he explores the expressive potential of low-end imaging devices such as the Fairlight CVI, Amiga, and Macintosh computers in an \"active, physical experience.\" Gorewitz's canvas is broad; he records a multi-cultural mosaic of urban and pastoral landscapes, from New York City's South Bronx and the American South to Jamaica, Morocco, and Israel. He filters his themes through a subjective analysis, creating moments of haunting beauty or menace as metaphorical visual expressions. Personal symbolism and social consciousness are inextricably intertwined in Gorewitz's unique visions, which resonate with an underlying spiritual, almost mystical power.\n\nIn addition to ongoing work with video, he is producing digital prints and work created specifically for the World Wide Web.\n\nGorewitz was born in 1949. He received a B.F.A. from the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied with Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins and Allan Kaprow; and an M.F.A. from Antioch International University. The 1989 recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Gorewitz has also received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. He was an artist in residence at the Experimental Television Center, Owego, New York, from 1978-93, and was artist-in-residence at the Beersheva Institute of Art in Jerusalem. Currently a professor of Multimedia Arts at Ramapo College, New Jersey, he has also taught at the University of Bridgeport and Hofstra University. Gorewitz's work has been exhibited internationally, at festivals and institutions including the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh; Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition, New York; Jewish Museum, New York; Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Kowasaki Museum, Tokyo. His work has been featured on National Public Television, the Learning Channel, the USA Cable Network, and many regional PBS stations. He lives in New York City.\n\nReferences:\nTravels, 1979-1980, 28:05 min, color, sound\nMeasurements of Volatility, 1979, 6 min.\nEl Corandero, 1979, 5:33 min.\nExcavations, 1979, 4:48 min.\nAutumn Floods, 1979, 6:10 min.\nDelta Visions, 1980, 4:24 min.\nU.S. Sweat, 1982, 16:10 min, color, sound\nSubatomic Babies, 1983, 8:07 min, color, sound\nA Conversation with Robert Longo, 1984, 11:17 min, color, sound\nMelehi, 1984, 25:10 min, color, sound\nDissonant Landscapes, 1984-86, 14:39 min, color, sound\nBlue Swee: Some thoughts on the U.S. invasion of Grenada, 1984, 3:32 min.\nRun (It's A Long Way If You're Walking), 1985, 3:41 min.\nBeggar's Prayer, 1986, 2:45 min.\nBlack Fire, 1986, 4:41 min.\nDigressions on Unity, 1987-90, 24:31 min, b&w and color, sound\nA Small Jubilee, 1987, 7:04 min, b&w and color.\nAfter the Storm, 1988, 10 min, color.\nThe End of Television, 1989, 4:27 min, color.\nJerusalem Road, 1990, 3 min, color.\nPromised Land, 1990, 7:16 min, color, sound\nDamaged Visions, 1991, 9 min, color, sound\nTen Thousand Things, 1992, 11:51 min, color, sound\nEclipse, 1993, 9:50 min, color, sound\nDark Light, 1994, 6:40 min, color, sound\nThe Last Tourist, 1994, 6 min, color, sound\nUnguarded Moments, 1996, 10 min, color, sound\nEmpathy and Abstraction, 1998, 10 min, color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:23:20.344584+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2ef4abda-de06-4914-81fa-d839e35e7ced", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110038", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

His most successful film was The Back of Beyond (1954), but many of his films garnered awards at festivals around the world. He was committed to the whole process of filmmaking from the initial research phase to distribution and exhibition. While he was grounded in the British documentary tradition, particularly during his years at the Australian National Film Board working under Ralph Foster and Stanley Hawes, he developed his own style noted for its lyrical quality.\nHeyer was an active participant in the documentary film movement in Australia in the 1940s and 1950s: he was among the first producers employed by the Australian National Film Board, was head of the Shell Film Unit in Australia, and was President of the Sydney Film Society and on the committee which organised the first Sydney Film Festival. He moved to England in 1956 where he continued to make films for Shell, and then through his own company. While he died in England, he maintained contact with Australia throughout his life, producing films in both countries.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:53:42.520957+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2329, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Heyer"}], "uuid": "658b379c-5ab1-4134-8774-a0241365c3ac", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35332", "external_references": [{"id": 9990, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q15458128"}, {"id": 9991, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "91830253"}, {"id": 9992, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87914434"}, {"id": 9993, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87914434"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:30:17.297462+10:00"}

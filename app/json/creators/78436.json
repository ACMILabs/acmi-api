Morse (January 30, 1906 â€“ May 19, 1984) was an American film director and editor. He is perhaps best known for directing the American scenes in Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, the \"Americanized\" version of the 1954 Japanese Godzilla film from Toho. The film went on to long-lasting success with regular showings at drive-in theatres, repertory theatres and on television.

It is the oldest museum in Australia, and the fifth oldest natural history museum in the world, with an international reputation in the fields of natural history and anthropology. It was first conceived and developed along the contemporary European model of an encyclopedic warehouse of cultural and natural history and features collections of vertebrate and invertebrate zoology, as well as mineralogy, palaeontology and anthropology. Apart from exhibitions, the museum is also involved in Indigenous studies research and community programs. In the museum's early years, collecting was its main priority, and specimens were commonly traded with British and other European institutions. The scientific stature of the museum was established under the curatorship of Gerard Krefft, himself a published scientist.\r\nThe museum is located at the corner of William Street and College Street in the Sydney central business district, in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, and was originally known as the Colonial Museum or Sydney Museum. The museum was renamed in June 1836 by a sub-committee meeting, when it was resolved during an argument that it should be renamed the \"Australian Museum\". The Australian Museum building and its collection was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.Its current CEO and Executive Director is Kim McKay .", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:51:02+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5695, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Museum"}], "uuid": "078fefab-dd32-43a3-b0cb-90853c0972a6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4680", "external_references": [{"id": 51573, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q769416"}, {"id": 54020, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "143064566"}, {"id": 54021, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n80069073"}, {"id": 54022, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n80069073"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T23:58:04.044411+11:00"}

She was one of three acting sisters from a show-business family. Beginning her career on the stage, Bennett appeared in more than 70 films from the era of silent films, well into the sound era. She is best remembered for her film noir femme fatale roles in director Fritz Lang's films—including Man Hunt (1941), The Woman in the Window (1944), and Scarlet Street (1945)—and for her television role as matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (and ancestors Naomi Collins, Judith Collins, Flora Collins, and Flora Collins PT) in the gothic 1960s soap opera Dark Shadows, for which she received an Emmy nomination in 1968.\nBennett's career had three distinct phases: first as a winsome blonde ingenue, then as a sensuous brunette femme fatale (with looks that movie magazines often compared to those of Hedy Lamarr), and finally as a warmhearted wife-and-mother figure.\nIn 1951, Bennett's screen career was marred by scandal after her third husband, film producer Walter Wanger, shot and injured her agent Jennings Lang. Wanger suspected that she and Lang were having an affair, a charge which she adamantly denied. She married four times.\nFor her final film role, as Madame Blanc in Dario Argento's cult horror film Suspiria (1977), she received a Saturn Award nomination.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:32:11.591003+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4340, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bennett"}], "uuid": "96293d29-8be1-44d6-b10e-63a695ab704c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31850", "external_references": [{"id": 25169, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q128944"}, {"id": 29403, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "32186172"}, {"id": 29404, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86075553"}, {"id": 29405, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86075553"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T15:32:15.384024+10:00"}

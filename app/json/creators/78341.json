His first major gothic horror film was The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), which launched Hammer's association with the genre and made British actors Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee leading horror stars of the era. He went on to film several adaptations of classic horror subjects, including Dracula (1958), The Mummy (1959), and The Curse of the Werewolf (1961).\nGiven their subject matter and lurid approach, Fisher's films, though commercially successful, were largely dismissed by critics during his career. It is only in recent years that Fisher has become recognised as an auteur in his own right. His most famous films are characterised by a blend of fairytale myth and the supernatural alongside themes of sexuality, morality, and \"the charm of evil\", often drawing heavily on a conservative Christian outlook.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:15:55.691002+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3185, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Fisher"}], "uuid": "a6b240eb-3dbf-4ffe-a8bf-463e2a5cd683", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29558", "external_references": [{"id": 13498, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q951821"}, {"id": 13499, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "2478982"}, {"id": 13500, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n84238762"}, {"id": 13501, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n84238762"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T17:15:55.703159+10:00"}

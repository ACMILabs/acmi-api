Wurtzel to Hollywood, California to oversee the studio's new West Coast production facilities, where the climate was more hospitable for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, the company bought the patents of the Movietone sound system for recording sound onto film.\nAfter the Wall Street crash of 1929, William Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney Kent, the new owners began conversations of a fusion with Twentieth Century Pictures, under founders Joseph M. Schenck and his friend Darryl Zanuck. Schenck, Zanuck, and Spyros Skouras merged the Fox Studios with Twentieth Century to form 20th Century-Fox in 1935.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T19:45:33.315171+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3978, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Film"}], "uuid": "0a90759b-2dcf-4080-a19a-9e0a44023aed", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8474", "external_references": [{"id": 34599, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2644123"}, {"id": 54427, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "151237948"}, {"id": 54428, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87847965"}, {"id": 54429, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87847965"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:45:35.740380+10:00"}

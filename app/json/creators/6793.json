Graduating in 1997, Phillip's final year film 'Denial', a raw, visceral film about child abuse, went on to win a number of awards and screened at over 25 festivals internationally. More recent short films 'First Love' and 'Rule of Thumb' have also screened at a number of festivals and explored cruelty, beauty and isolation as seen through the eyes of young people. In 1998, Phillip began working with BIG hART - an award winning arts company that initiate arts projects with marginalised young people. Working with 250 young people in regional Australia the outcome was the featurette 'Hurt' which has screened internationally and led to a number of similar film and video projects engaging young people around Australia. A multi-screen installation version of this work has been commissioned for exhibition within the screeen gallery. Currently, Phillip is creative director of 'Not at Home', a film, video and performance project exploring issues of homelessness with young people around the country.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:08:19.765909+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "36694f74-e8c9-44f5-b1bb-faa1f041c7e0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110686", "external_references": [{"id": 35056, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121058101"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:08:19.766163+11:00"}

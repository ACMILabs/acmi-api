Her interest in early cinema has led her to explore links between 19th-century industrial mechanics and 20th-century computer technologies, in the transition from the \"real\" world to virtual space. Writes Beloff: \"Interactive cinema is itself an emerging media. Its language is in the process of being invented. This is my ongoing project.\"\n\nBeloff often collaborates with artists from other disciplines, such as her interactive CD-ROM project Where Where There There Where, which was a collaboration with the Wooster Group, and a film/music/slide performance with John Cale.\n\nBeloff was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. She received an MA from Edinburgh University and an MFA in film studies from Columbia University, and was in the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art. She teaches digital media at City College in New York. Her work has been shown at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Biennial de l'image, Paris; Galerie Vox, Montreal; and the San Francisco Cinematheque, among others. Beloff lives in New York.\nReferences:\nWhere Where There There Where, 1998, CD-ROM, ,", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:38:15.922155+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "42a874a9-79df-4cbf-a30c-cc18b4369a6f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110023", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:38:15.922394+11:00"}

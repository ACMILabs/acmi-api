He was one of several Canadian-born expatriate filmmakers, including Norman Jewison and Sidney J. Furie, to find critical and commercial success overseas in the 1960s due to the limited opportunities in the Canadian film industry at the time. He was the patriarch of the Petrie filmmaking family, with four of his children all working in the film industry.\nBeginning his career in television, he made his critical and popular breakthrough directing the 1961 film version of the Lorraine Hansberry play A Raisin in the Sun, which won the Gary Cooper Award at the Cannes Film Festival. He directed over 90 films and television programs until his retirement in 2001, winning several accolades (including three Primetime Emmy Awards) in the process. His semi-autobiographical 1984 film The Bay Boy won the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture.\nThroughout his life, Petrie maintained strong ties to the academic world, serving as the deputy chairman of the American Film Institute from 1986 to 1987.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:32:49.496164+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3822, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Petrie"}], "uuid": "8b33b133-c680-4bd0-9236-f04493d9ee81", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "17404", "external_references": [{"id": 25006, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q705572"}, {"id": 27998, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "2657363"}, {"id": 27999, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n78043866"}, {"id": 28000, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n78043866"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:32:49.527682+10:00"}, {"id": 77238, "name": "Lili Zanuck", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2212113, "title": "Driving Miss Daisy", "work_id": 83073, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2140575, "title": "Cocoon (Captioned)", "work_id": 82760, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2140272, "title": "Cocoon: the return (Captioned)", "work_id": 82761, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2140230, "title": "Cocoon", "work_id": 93755, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "02 APR 1954", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Married to Richard D Zanuck", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T15:47:34.359852+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "5af77240-5173-489d-bf84-8e7dcb210e0c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23841", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

She is regarded as Australia's first film star, and also contributed to the local industry during the silent era through her collaborations with director and writer Raymond Longford.\nShe was born in Balmain, a suburb in Sydney, New South Wales in 1890. By 1912, Lyell had become romantically involved with Longford. The couple lived together in Brisbane and formed one of the most productive and influential partnerships in the history of Australian cinema. Although Longford was separated, his Catholic wife would not divorce him and he was never able to marry Lyell. Lyell fell ill with tuberculosis and died at her home in Roseville, North Sydney on 21 December 1925. Longford died in 1959, and is buried alongside Lyell at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:58:52.654872+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4566, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottie_Lyell"}], "uuid": "f454f6ed-c6e3-4b7b-bcd1-516d404dd55a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34598", "external_references": [{"id": 25284, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6685026"}, {"id": 29993, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "44088708"}, {"id": 29994, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2007121845"}, {"id": 29995, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2007121845"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-17T17:40:48.210058+10:00"}

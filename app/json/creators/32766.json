Gaining recognition from these films she was approached to write a treatment that would eventually become her debut feature film Ratcatcher funded by BBC Scotland and Pathé. Ramsay’s Ratcatcher was given many awards along with Ramsay being awarded  BAFTA’s Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer.\nHer films are marked by a fascination with children and young people and the recurring themes of grief, guilt, death, and its aftermath. They are low on dialogue and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music, and sound design to create their worlds. In April 2013, she was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In 2015, she was named as a member of the jury for the main competition at the 2015 Venice Film Festival.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:00:56.992899+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4584, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Ramsay"}], "uuid": "8526482b-a8dd-4393-b068-e4999b56316d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24145", "external_references": [{"id": 26319, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3269591"}, {"id": 30038, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "21790323"}, {"id": 30039, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2001032610"}, {"id": 30040, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2001032610"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:06.416747+10:00"}

He was born in Wallasey, Merseyside and studied both painting and filmmaking. Mulloy worked as a screenwriter and director of live-action films until the late 1980s before becoming an animator. His animations have been described as \"satirical grotesque\" and often portray the dark side of human nature and contemporary social, political, and religious values in a humorous and at times, shocking way. His visual style is distinctive in its use of primitive, often skeletal figures and minimalist backgrounds. Mulloy has made over 30 animated films many of which are in themed groupings based on Hollywood genres. Mulloy has won many international awards for his work and has conducted several workshops for young animators.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:37:10.061919+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4907, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mulloy"}], "uuid": "a2906156-973f-4c2d-b4ac-24a74b09e0a1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "26791", "external_references": [{"id": 26487, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3378816"}, {"id": 30864, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "244003"}, {"id": 30865, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2010013010"}, {"id": 30866, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2010013010"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:59.414260+10:00"}

In 1947, he was named as one of the Hollywood Ten, a group of blacklisted film industry professionals who refused to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in their investigations during the McCarthy-era Red Scare. They all served time in prison for contempt of Congress. In 1951, however, Dmytryk testified to the HUAC and named individuals, including Arnold Manoff, whose careers were then destroyed for many years, to rehabilitate his own career.  First hired again by independent producer Stanley Kramer in 1952, Dmytryk is likely best known for directing The Caine Mutiny (1954), a critical and commercial success. The second-highest-grossing film of the year, it was nominated for Best Picture and several other awards at the 1955 Oscars. Dmytryk was nominated for a Directors Guild Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:45:01.713182+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1977, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Dmytryk"}], "uuid": "b5fc95c1-47bc-46e0-b4f2-4a49bccc8e0c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18590", "external_references": [{"id": 8552, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q72229"}, {"id": 8553, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "122235964"}, {"id": 8554, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n78043765"}, {"id": 8555, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n78043765"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T10:51:11.248085+10:00"}, {"id": 77701, "name": "Kenneth Hyman", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2354424, "title": "The Hill", "work_id": 89732, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2345506, "title": "The Dirty dozen", "work_id": 84655, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Kenneth Hyman (born December 11, 1928) is an American film producer, best known for The Dirty Dozen (1967).

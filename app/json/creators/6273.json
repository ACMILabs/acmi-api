In elegant works that emphasize the significance of the quotidian, the everyday gesture, and the intimate detail, Andre suggests a personal dialogue between the artist and her predominantly female subjects.\n\nEmploying thematic and formal strategies that are often cinematic (c.f. the works of Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman), Andre brings the intimacy of scale and observed detail that is unique to video to her eloquent portraits of the everyday. Andre's singular mode of vision is both precise and sensual. Her distanced camera, reductive editing, and spare mise en scene create formal compositions that suggest framed paintings, while her impassive gaze and visual acuity reveal the private space and psychological nuances of the women on the screen.\n\nIn document or fiction, from the dance of Repetitions (1985) to the social critique of Un ange passe (1985), Andre observes narratives of desire, romances of the everyday. With minimal but lush images that distill the very essence of her subjects, Andre's works establish a rich, intimate sense of time, mood and place.\n\nMarie Andre was born in Brussels in 1951. After studying theater at the Institut National Superior des Arts du Spectacle in Brussels, she studied dance at the Byrd Hoffman Foundation in New York. She began working in 35mm film after studying screenwriting at an American Film Institute program in Brussels, and later turned to video.\n\nWinner of the Grand Prix from the Festival International d'Art Video de Locarno, she is also the recipient of awards from the Festival of San Sebastian, Spain, and the Minister of French Culture in Brussels. Her videotapes have been broadcast widely in Europe and exhibited internationally at festivals and institutions including the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Long Beach Museum of Art, California; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; and the International Festival of Video Art, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. She currently teaches at the Sint Lukas Institute for the Visual Arts, Brussels. Andre lives in Brussels.\nReferences:\nCinema\nLes Pas perdus, 1980, 13 min\nLe Fil des jours, 1994, 70 min\nVideo\nGalerie de portraits, 1982, 45 min, color, sound\nCome ti amo, 1983, 22 min\nInformator, 1983, 7 min\nConstant, 1984, 10 min, color, sound\nCrossing Way, 4 min\nRepetitions, 1985, 45 min, b&w and color, sound\nCompositie, 1985, 9 min, b&w, sound\nHus Walter, 1985, 8 min\nUn ange passe, 1985, 41:05, color, sound\nEvento, 1986-87, 25 min, color, sound\nUne visite a Moscou, 1987, 46 min\nBruxelles, une ville en ete, 1987, 11 min, color, sound\nOn, 1989, l min\nappelait president !, 1989, 35 min\nPremier amour, 1991, 36 min\nKagel-Musique, 1993-95, 36 min\nHombre alado, 1995, 36 min\nSavitz Kaya, poete, 1997, 52 min\nNarcisse aux chiens, 1997, ? min\nBibliography:\nMichel Jakar, Reflections on Marie Andre's `A visit to Moscow'\n\n\nPlease note: another bio image can be found at: http://www.acmi.net.au/platform1_public/Andre_M/m_andre2.gif", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:35:02.109291+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "e6f03c98-115f-41d6-88d2-4811b89053fc", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110018", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:35:02.109492+11:00"}

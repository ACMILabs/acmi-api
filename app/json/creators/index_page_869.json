His career flourished from the silent era of the 1920s through the American New Wave, as he appeared in a total of 179 film and television productions. He was among the top box-office draws for three decades, and he appeared with many other important Hollywood stars of his era. In 1999, the American Film Institute selected Wayne as one of the greatest male stars of classic American cinema.Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa, but he grew up in Southern California. After losing his football scholarship to the University of Southern California from a bodysurfing accident, he began working for the Fox Film Corporation. He appeared mostly in small parts, but his first leading role came in Raoul Walsh's Western The Big Trail (1930), an early widescreen film epic that was a box-office failure. He played leading roles in numerous B movies during the 1930s, most of them also Westerns, without becoming a major name. John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) made Wayne a mainstream star, and he starred in 142 motion pictures altogether. According to one biographer, \"John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage.\"Wayne's other roles in Westerns include a cattleman driving his herd on the Chisholm Trail in Red River (1948), a Civil War veteran whose niece is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in The Searchers (1956), a troubled rancher competing with a lawyer (James Stewart) for a woman's hand in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), and a cantankerous one-eyed marshal in True Grit (1969), for which he received the Academy Award for Best Actor. He is also remembered for his roles in The Quiet Man (1952) with Maureen O'Hara, Rio Bravo (1959) with Dean Martin, and The Longest Day (1962). In his final screen performance, he starred as an aging gunfighter battling cancer in The Shootist (1976). He made his last public appearance at the Academy Awards ceremony on April 9, 1979, and died of stomach cancer two months later. In 1980, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor of the United States.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:40:10.918803+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4417, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne"}], "uuid": "ba4cfd7f-d620-42c0-b201-dc5de76da49f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22577", "external_references": [{"id": 25587, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q40531"}, {"id": 29596, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "37103799"}, {"id": 29597, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79046229"}, {"id": 29598, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79046229"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T21:46:03.742126+10:00"}, {"id": 76822, "name": "Gregory Peck", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1985258, "title": "How the West was won", "work_id": 81186, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2151562, "title": "On the beach", "work_id": 84979, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2334191, "title": "The Boys from Brazil", "work_id": 84629, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2331445, "title": "The Big country (S)", "work_id": 83397, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2344602, "title": "The Dove", "work_id": 86284, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Eldred Gregory Peck", "date_of_birth": "1916-04-05", "date_of_death": "2003-06-12", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Eldred Gregory Peck (April 5, 1916 – June 12, 2003) was an American actor and one of the most popular film stars from the 1940s to the 1970s. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Peck the 12th-greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema.\nAfter studying at the Neighborhood Playhouse with Sanford Meisner, Peck began appearing in stage productions, acting in over 50 plays and three Broadway productions. He first gained critical success in The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), a John M. Stahl–directed drama which earned him his first Academy Award nomination. He starred in a series of successful films, including romantic-drama The Valley of Decision (1944), Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945), and family film The Yearling (1946). He encountered lukewarm commercial reviews at the end of the 1940s, his performances including The Paradine Case (1947) and The Great Sinner (1948). Peck reached global recognition in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing back-to-back in the book-to-film adaptation of Captain Horatio Hornblower (1951) and biblical drama David and Bathsheba (1951). He starred alongside Ava Gardner in The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952) and Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday (1953).\nOther notable films in which he appeared include  Moby Dick (1956, and its 1998 mini-series), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Cape Fear (1962, and its 1991 remake), The Omen (1976), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). Throughout his career, he often portrayed protagonists with \"fiber\" within a moral setting. Gentleman's Agreement (1947) centered on topics of antisemitism, while Peck's character in Twelve O'Clock High (1949) dealt with post-traumatic stress disorder during World War II. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), an adaptation of the modern classic of the same name which revolved around racial inequality, for which he received universal acclaim. In 1983, he starred opposite Christopher Plummer in The Scarlet and The Black as Hugh O'Flaherty, a Catholic priest who saved thousands of escaped Allied POWs and Jewish people in Rome during the Second World War.\nPeck was also active in politics, challenging the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 and was regarded as a political opponent by President Richard Nixon.

During a six-decade career, Scofield achieved the Triple Crown of Acting, winning an Academy Award, Emmy, and Tony for his work. He won the three awards in a seven-year span, the fastest of any performer to accomplish the feat.\nScofield received Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play at the 1962 Tony Awards for portraying Sir Thomas More in the Broadway production of A Man for All Seasons. Four years later, he won the Academy Award for Best Actor when he reprised the role in the 1966 film adaptation, making him one of eleven to receive a Tony and Academy Award for the same role. His Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie was achieved for the 1969 television film Male of the Species.\nPreferring the stage to the screen and putting his family before his career, Scofield nonetheless established a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean performers. Among other accolades, his performance as Mark Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994) earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and he won Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the BAFTA Awards for portraying Thomas Danforth in The Crucible (1996). Scofield declined the honour of a knighthood, but was appointed CBE in 1956 and became a Companion of Honour in 2001.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:31:39.211352+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4858, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scofield"}], "uuid": "c31d2cfc-e912-4997-91b1-a26a886e56bb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 26875, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q223988"}, {"id": 30730, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "104001165"}, {"id": 30731, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n84130839"}, {"id": 30732, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n84130839"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T16:31:42.539730+10:00"}

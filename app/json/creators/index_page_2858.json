Working with the Fairlight Computer Video Instrument (CVI), Fitzgerald generates and orchestrates imagery in real time, creating vivid compositions of color, form, light, time, and sound that unfold by the artist's hand. Since 1985, she has applied this technique of improvisational \"video painting\" to live music/video performances with musicians, including Peter Gordon, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Max Roach.\n\nFitzgerald trained as a painter, and her video drawings, with their lush palettes and rich textures made kinetic by electronic manipulation, display an evocative visual sensibility. Modelling her pictorial aesthetic on musical composition, she builds visual rhythm through theme and variations. Her tactile manipulation of the medium -- the physicality of the gesture -- results in what she terms \"technology with a humanness.\"\n\nPrior to her work with the Fairlight CVI, Fitzgerald won acclaim for her innovative body of video works produced in collaboration with John Sanborn.\n\nFitzgerald is the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS) Program. She was artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen from 1977 to 1982, and has been a member of the Directors Guild of America since 1980. She was a 1989 Fellow of the American Film Institute Directing Workshop for Women. Fitzgerald's work has been broadcast around the world, and exhibited at festivals and institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Institute of Contemporary Art, London; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; Gallery Watari, Tokyo; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Bonn Videonale; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.

Resonating with a highly metaphorical sensibility, Cho's single-channel tapes and installations are formalist, almost painterly explorations of subjectivity and the subconscious. The urban landscapes that Cho often depicts move with a continuous fluidity, shifting from dreamlike abstractions of light to fleeting reflections of the city. Figures, cars, and trains are mirrored and diffused through one another, silhouetted with a haunting anonymity that is echoed in the poetic texts and soundscapes that accompany each piece. These often tense meditations focus on the nature and cost of isolation and loneliness while integrating into a culture, landscape and language other than one's own.\n\nSeoungho Cho was born in 1959 in Seoul, South Korea. He received his B.A. and M.A. in Graphic Arts from Hong-Ik University, Korea, and an M.A. in video art from New York University. In 1998 he received a Rockefeller Foundation Media Arts Fellowship. He has received the \"Juror?s Citation\" at the 18th Annual Black Maria Film and Video Festival, the Jack Goodman Fellowship in New York, and was specially selected in the Korean Art Competition five years in a row.

In Cahen's uniquely nuanced world, fiction and document alike are presented as metaphoric voyages of the imaginary, exquisite reveries that describe passages of time, place, memory and perception. Genres such as narrative and performance are expanded and transformed as he explores visual, aural and temporal transformations of represented reality.\n\nFrom the formal elegance of Cartes postales video (Video Postcards), 1984-86) to the intricate musical and visual transitions of Boulez-Repons, 1985), Cahen's work is characterized by a sophisticated application of electronic techniques that manipulate sound and image, space and temporality, resulting in subtle transmutations of the illusory and the real. Building on his extensive research in acoustics, music, and filmmaking, he plays with the textures of sound and image to restructure representational modes, from the optical to the sonic, from the \"picturesque\" photograph to the conventions of narrative cinema. Resonating with wit and charm, executed with technical precision, his works allude to both formal and thematic motifs of travel, movement, and transition. Cahen's dreamlike journeys depict fleeting glimpses of a transitory reality, transformed in time within the pictorial frame.\n\nRobert Cahen was born in Valence, France in 1945. He graduated from the Conservatoire National Superieur Musique de Paris, and was a member of the Groupe de Recherche Musicales de l'ORTF (the Office of French Radio and Television) from 1971-74. From 1973- 76, he was director of Experimental Video for ORTF/INA. Many of his film and video works have been produced in conjunction with Institut National Audiovisuel (INA), the French television production facility. His videotapes have been broadcast and exhibited internationally, at institutions and festivals including the Paris Biennale; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; American Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; International Center of Photography, New York; Documenta 8, Kassel, Germany; FestRio, Brazil; Tokyo Festival; and the Festival of Locarno, Italy.

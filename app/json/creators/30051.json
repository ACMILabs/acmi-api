Founded in 1934, the company is best known for a series of Gothic horror and fantasy films made from the mid-1950s until the 1970s. Many of these involve classic horror characters such as Baron Victor Frankenstein, Count Dracula, and the Mummy, which Hammer reintroduced to audiences by filming them in vivid colour for the first time. Hammer also produced science fiction, thrillers, film noir and comedies, as well as, in later years, television series.\nDuring its most successful years, Hammer dominated the horror film market, enjoying worldwide distribution and considerable financial success. This success was, in part, due to its distribution partnerships with American companies United Artists, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, American International Pictures and Seven Arts Productions.\nDuring the late 1960s and 1970s, the saturation of the horror film market by competitors and the loss of American funding forced changes to the previously lucrative Hammer formula with varying degrees of success. The company eventually ceased production in the mid-1980s. In 2000, the studio was bought by a consortium including advertising executive and art collector Charles Saatchi and publishing millionaires Neil Mendoza and William Sieghart. The company announced plans to begin making films again, but none was produced.\nIn May 2007, the company name was sold to a consortium headed by Dutch media tycoon John de Mol, who announced plans to spend some $50 million (£25m) on new horror films. The new organization acquired the Hammer group's film library of 295 pictures. Simon Oakes, who took over as CEO of the new Hammer, said, \"Hammer is a great British brand—we intend to take it back into production and develop its global potential. The brand is still alive but no one has invested in it for a long time.\"Since then, Hammer has produced several films, including Beyond the Rave (2008), Let Me In (2010), The Resident (2011), The Woman in Black (2012), The Quiet Ones (2014), and The Lodge (2019).\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:27:45.010407+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5855, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_Film_Productions"}], "uuid": "0cc71173-4992-47f7-a7e1-571fdc7d2852", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8973", "external_references": [{"id": 41796, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1433745"}, {"id": 54603, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "155937625"}, {"id": 54604, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n84075176"}, {"id": 54605, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n84075176"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:27:45.031761+10:00"}

Supported by the waterside workers’ union, the film unit conceived of cinema as a tool of social change. With the slogan \"We film the facts\", their films covered issues such as housing shortages, industrial disputes, workers’ rights, and training in health and safety. The 13 films made by the unit include the seminal The Hungry Miles (1955). All three members of the film unit – Disher, Keith Gow and Jock Levy – met as members of the New Theatre, a progressive theatre company formed in the early 1930s by the Communist Party of Australia, that was highly significant in the creation of a vernacular Australian performing arts tradition. Disher's work with the New Theatre continued after the demise of the WWF Film Unit, as did her lifelong interest in music and production design. At age 98 she was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the University of NSW (in 2020).", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-13T00:27:18.411552+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "e6c8538c-f6a2-4c34-b571-672d68ef956a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25874", "external_references": [{"id": 41049, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121035839"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T00:27:18.411856+11:00"}

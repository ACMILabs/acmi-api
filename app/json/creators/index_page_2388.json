"biography": "Jennifer Ann Barraclough OBE (born 2 May 1937) is a British film and television producer. Much of her work is in television documentaries. She has also been involved in a number of trusts and charities. They include the Grierson Trust (Chairman between 2006 and 2009)  and LEPRA  (Chairman between 2007 and 2011)  and the Razumovsky Ensemble  of which she is a Trustee.\n\nBarraclough was educated at St Brandon's School (Somerset), Millfield (Somerset), and St Hilda's College, Oxford, where she achieved a BA Hons in English.\n\nBarraclough was one of the first women television producers. Barraclough's film Gale is Dead (1971) was one of the first to draw attention to young homeless and drug addicts and contributed to the establishment of a House of Commons committee. Her film Women in Prison in 1972 (which won a BAFTA) was the first film to be shot in a women's prison in the UK. In the 1980s she made two films on Queen Elizabeth II and two on 10 Downing Street for BBC One. Barraclough also produced films on the arts, including one on the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and a major series on the London Symphony Orchestra in 1986.\n\nBarraclough's films on AIDS helped promote understanding of the disease in its early days. Barraclough also produced other series focused on medicine, including series on transplant surgery and the history of cancer. Films for BBC World have included projects on leprosy (2001), vaccination (2004), and international efforts to prevent the spread of avian flu. In 2005 Barraclough produced a widely distributed film on the MMR vaccine for the Department of Health.\n\nShe was made a member of two BBC think tanks.\n\nBarraclough was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours.

However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences soon found out the film had been shown first in October 1967, thus making it ineligible for a 1968 award and the Oscar was revoked. (This marks the only time, as of 2021, where an Academy Award was first awarded and then revoked.) Grasshoff, who reportedly slept with the Oscar on the first night, also directed Academy Award-nominated films The Really Big Family (1966) and Journey to the Outer Limits (1973). He also directed the award-winning The Wave (1981), based on Ron Jones' The Third Wave experiment, and Future Shock (1972), based on Alvin Toffler's book and hosted by Orson Welles.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:44:23.941654+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1593, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grasshoff"}], "uuid": "d402f864-298f-4c50-928f-ca52c9831753", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14889", "external_references": [{"id": 6968, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q379191"}, {"id": 6969, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "92033039"}, {"id": 6970, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr98006206"}, {"id": 6971, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr98006206"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T01:11:22.385993+11:00"}, {"id": 15212, "name": "Metro Media Corporation", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2714428, "title": "Future shock", "work_id": 67923, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "b5400437-8c1a-419a-a25f-02e6b9ddcad5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10485", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T01:11:21.689178+11:00"}]}

A four-time Academy Award nominee, he was known for his portrayal of \"moody, sensitive young men\", according to The New York Times.He is best remembered for his roles in Howard Hawks's Red River (1948), George Stevens's A Place in the Sun (1951), Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953), Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and John Huston's The Misfits (1961).\nAlong with Marlon Brando and James Dean, Clift was considered one of the original method actors in Hollywood (though Clift distanced himself from the term); he was one of the first actors to be invited to study in the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan. He also executed a rare move by not signing a contract after arriving in Hollywood, only doing so after his first two films were a success. This was described as \"a power differential that would go on to structure the star–studio relationship for the next 40 years\". A documentary titled Making Montgomery Clift was made by his nephew in 2018, to clarify myths that were created about the actor.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:20:55.827602+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6048, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift"}], "uuid": "9de688b9-0118-42bc-9cf3-45f2c898e1f6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 51957, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q193102"}, {"id": 55309, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "12318841"}, {"id": 55310, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79068349"}, {"id": 55311, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79068349"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:20:58.644436+10:00"}

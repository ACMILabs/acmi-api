He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller\", having begun his career at the height of the Cold War.He was technically highly accomplished from his days in live television; many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.Movie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment—things that were facing us all.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:01:34.825836+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2419, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer"}], "uuid": "7a078520-e74c-47da-8d45-e55015561254", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22264", "external_references": [{"id": 10352, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q262820"}, {"id": 10353, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117354"}, {"id": 10354, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86143617"}, {"id": 10355, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86143617"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-17T10:45:26.616305+11:00"}, {"id": 23510, "name": "Michael Radford", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475722, "title": "The Postman = Il Postino", "work_id": 89776, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2161709, "title": "Nineteen Eighty-Four", "work_id": 81256, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1946-02-24", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Michael James Radford (born 24 February 1946) is an English film director and screenwriter.

It is responsible for some of Australia's best-known and most successful films, including the four Mad Max films, the two Babe films, and the two Happy Feet films.\nKennedy Miller Mitchell is one of Australia's oldest existing film production companies, and the most successful internationally. Its principals are George Miller and Doug Mitchell who has been a financial partner in the enterprise since 1981 and is George Miller's producing partner.\nMany of the films are directed by the co-founder, George Miller, though he sometimes takes an organisational role and prefers to use someone else to direct, as with Babe, which was directed by Chris Noonan.The company's most recent project was the fourth Mad Max film, titled Mad Max: Fury Road. After being \"in development hell for 25 years\", the film was released on 15 May 2015, to critical acclaim but financial underperformance.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T22:05:26.787364+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5959, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Miller_Mitchell"}], "uuid": "6ba2ce90-a888-4cee-8dd9-7d9f17f7f5fe", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "9729", "external_references": [{"id": 34523, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6389652"}, {"id": 54999, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "2928148209329500460009"}, {"id": 55000, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2016163698"}, {"id": 55001, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2016163698"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T19:27:54.961152+11:00"}

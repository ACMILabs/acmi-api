He is best known for his 1971 novel, The Exorcist, and for his 1973 screenplay for the film adaptation of the same name. Blatty won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for The Exorcist, and was nominated for Best Picture as its producer. The film also earned Blatty a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama as producer.\nBorn and raised in New York City, Blatty received his bachelor's degree in English from Georgetown University in 1950, and his master's degree in English literature from the George Washington University. Following completion of his master's degree in 1954, he joined the United States Air Force and served in the Psychological Warfare Division where he attained the rank of first lieutenant. After service in the air force, he worked for the United States Information Agency in Beirut.\nAfter the success of The Exorcist, Blatty reworked his 1966 novel Twinkle, Twinkle, \"Killer\" Kane! into a new novel titled The Ninth Configuration, published in 1978. He went on to adapt the novel into a film of the same name, The Ninth Configuration (1980), which was also his directorial debut. At the 38th Golden Globe Awards, the film won Best Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture. \nBlatty refused to have any involvement with the first sequel to The Exorcist, which was ultimately critically panned. However, he would go on to write and direct the second sequel, The Exorcist III (1990), which he adapted from his 1983 novel Legion. His second film as a director, The Exorcist III would turn out to be both his final directorial credit and his final screenplay credit. Blatty would remain active as a novelist for the rest of his life; some of his later notable novels include Elsewhere (2009), Dimiter (2010) and Crazy (2010).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:28:07.287401+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5357, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Peter_Blatty"}], "uuid": "eca7fc5a-8c5f-4745-8858-b5400fde661c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30482", "external_references": [{"id": 26594, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q540784"}, {"id": 32027, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "4926864"}, {"id": 32028, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50009887"}, {"id": 32029, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50009887"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:17:35.695656+10:00"}, {"id": 26564, "name": "Indieprod", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2158883, "title": "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein [DVD]", "work_id": 91236, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991231, "title": "L.A.

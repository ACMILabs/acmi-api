He was nominated for Oscar and Palme d'Or awards, and won Locarno International Film Festival, Edgar Allan Poe Awards, French Legion of Honor, Golden Globe Award, French National Academy of Cinema and Honorary Cesar awards.\nAccording to one obituary:\n\nFor exactly 40 years, the prolific Verneuil made movies as mainstream and commercial as any to be found in America or Britain. In his best period – the 1950s and 1960s – he delivered films in the \"tradition of quality\" so despised by the Nouvelle Vague. Many of them proved excellent vehicles for old-timers Jean Gabin and Fernandel, and newcomers such as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:44:10.844711+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2220, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Verneuil"}], "uuid": "ac457bbd-6ef6-49a7-a81d-57a02c0c8931", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 9537, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55394"}, {"id": 9538, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "116333103"}, {"id": 9539, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85319470"}, {"id": 9540, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85319470"}], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}

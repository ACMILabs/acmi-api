Guest is most widely known in Hollywood for having written, directed, and starred in his series of comedy films shot in mockumentary style. Many scenes and character backgrounds in Guest's films are written and directed, although actors have no rehearsal time and the ensemble improvises scenes while filming them. The series of films began with This Is Spinal Tap (which he did not direct) and continued with Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind,  For Your Consideration, and Mascots.\nGuest holds a hereditary British peerage as the 5th Baron Haden-Guest, and has publicly expressed a desire to see the House of Lords reformed as a democratically elected chamber. Though he was initially active in the Lords, his career there was cut short by the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the right of most hereditary peers to a seat in the parliament. When using his title, he is normally styled as Lord Haden-Guest. Guest is married to the actress and author Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:26:57.838368+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1821, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Guest"}], "uuid": "c80e2f29-a19c-4321-b60c-67577acebb63", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16959", "external_references": [{"id": 7922, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q336074"}, {"id": 7923, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "66668009"}, {"id": 7924, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91079290"}, {"id": 7925, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91079290"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T10:40:55.417296+10:00"}

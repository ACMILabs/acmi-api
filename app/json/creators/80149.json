She was named by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest stars of classical Hollywood cinema and as of 2023, is one of the last surviving major stars from the era. Loren is also the only remaining living person to appear on AFI's list of the 50 greatest  stars of American film history, positioned 21st. \nEncouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her film career at age sixteen in 1950. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with Paramount in 1956 launched her international career. Her film appearances around this time include The Pride and the Passion, Houseboat, and It Started in Naples. During the 1950s, she starred in films as a sexually emancipated persona and was one of the best known sex symbols of the time.\nLoren's performance as Cesira in the film Two Women (1961) directed by Vittorio De Sica won her the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actor to win an Oscar for a non-English-language performance. She holds the record for having earned seven David di Donatello Awards for Best Actress: Two Women; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963); Marriage Italian Style (1964, for which she was nominated for a second Oscar); Sunflower (1970); The Voyage (1974); A Special Day (1977) and The Life Ahead (2020). She has won five special Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award), a BAFTA Award, a Laurel Award, a Grammy Award, the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, she received the Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievements.\nAt the start of the 1980s, Loren chose to make rarer film appearances. Since then, she has appeared in films such as Prêt-à-porter (1994), Grumpier Old Men (1995), Nine (2009), and The Life Ahead (2020).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:07:36.222136+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5178, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren"}], "uuid": "248efc13-afb5-4070-8214-a1a713378c1e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38152", "external_references": [{"id": 25147, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q43252"}, {"id": 31571, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "115103987"}, {"id": 31572, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50042300"}, {"id": 31573, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50042300"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T12:27:33.569306+10:00"}

In the 1980s, she used color film and large prints, and focused more on costume, lighting and facial expression.\nSherman was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship in 1995. She received an honorary doctorate degree from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2013.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:06:15.588131+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1828, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Sherman"}], "uuid": "427a8c39-e17c-45c2-b589-2acf15d0d9c8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 7947, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q229455"}, {"id": 7948, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "96462178"}, {"id": 7949, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83152180"}, {"id": 7950, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83152180"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T10:41:12.123716+10:00"}

It also expanded into the US, setting up an office in Los Angeles in order to make connections with the Hollywood crowd. This led to Winchester Films being granted distribution rights to Heartbreakers (the UK's largest distribution deal - $53 million).\nIn July 2003, the company acquired Cobalt Media who added their portfolio to that of Winchester's.

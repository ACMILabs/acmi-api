From his seminal guerrilla television work of the late 1960s and his alternative regional portraits of the 1970s, to his recent public television productions, he brings a distinctive, personal approach to the documentary form that, in his words, \"warms up the cool medium of television.\"\n\nBlumberg's energetic works give voice to the individual and the community, as he discovers the idiosyncratic and extraordinary in America's regions and subcultures, foregrounding games, sports, music, dance and performance as celebrations of cultural expression. Works such as Pick Up Your Feet: The Double Dutch Show (1981) are recognized classics of the genre. His more recent tapes are finely-crafted collaborations with performance artists.\n\nIn 1969, Blumberg was a co-founder of one of the earliest video collectives, the countercultural Videofreex, which established Lanesville TV as an artists' low-power television station in New York State. He was also a central participant in the pioneering guerrilla television group TVTV, where, applying the portability of small-format video equipment to the alternative media coverage of political events, he developed his characteristic personal interview style and informal, video verite techniques. In 1984 Blumberg was selected for Esquire magazine's register of \"The Best of the New Generation.\"\n\n\nRecognition: Blumberg has been artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York, and the 1980 Winter Olympics, and produced and directed many programs for the 'Alive From Off Center' series of KTCA TV, Minneapolis. He has received funding from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, among others. Blumberg's tapes have been broadcast on public and network television, and have been exhibited widely at institutions and festivals.\nExhibitions : The Museum of Modern Art, New York\nWalker Art Center, Minneapolis\nWhitney Museum of American Art, New York\nMuseum of Broadcasting, New York\nInternational Center of Photography, New York\nCentre Georges Pompidou, Paris\nBerlin Film Festival\nAmerican Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles\nDanish Video Festival, Copenhagen\nThe Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T22:45:32.869472+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "97564ed1-269f-4cc5-8cd5-4cda94325007", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110025", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T22:45:32.869803+11:00"}

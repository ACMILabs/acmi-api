He is also an active new media curator and sound engineer. Yuen has formal training as a composer at the Electronic Music Unit, University of Adelaide, under the guidance of Stephen Whittington. His work explores the sonic and the visual through the application of technology and works predominantly in installation. Elements of integrated interaction and computer-generated chance are used to create works, which are owned more by the public than the artist. He seeks an art of experience that rejects the notion of object-based art. Yuen‚Äùs research into interactive art has led him to develop camera based gesture recognition systems.\n(from www.yuen.va.com.au)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-05T11:34:53.307058+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "1312dda8-e4da-4e22-8518-138c02a4c431", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "3015", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T11:34:53.307365+11:00"}

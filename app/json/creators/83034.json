He developed the concept of continuum sonore to describe the potential for a film's soundtrack to interact with its visual content. During the early 1950s, he was part of a generation of composers associated with the Darmstadt School, and was a lifelong friend of Pierre Boulez. From 1962 until 1975, he regularly collaborated with Alain Robbe-Grillet on cinematic projects, creating partitions sonores (or \"sound-scores\") for five of Robbe-Grillet's films.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-15T11:54:40.725360+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4725, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Fano"}], "uuid": "ae7ca62e-c236-4aa9-b3e9-47af5a391d47", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31073", "external_references": [{"id": 26859, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3309599"}, {"id": 30394, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "94111981"}, {"id": 30395, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2004117252"}, {"id": 30396, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2004117252"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:11:52.721797+10:00"}

I'm Jewish myself, so this is exactly the question that I've been asking. What I love about horror films, and dark, edgy films, in general â€“ there's so much creative license to play with musical effects in non traditional ways. It's really fun as a composer.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:10:58.229003+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4720, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Yezerski"}], "uuid": "4dc29255-502d-41b2-955d-1953767507cd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37048", "external_references": [{"id": 25283, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6835480"}, {"id": 30383, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "311364781"}, {"id": 30384, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr2003025945"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:10:58.239033+10:00"}

The company is operated by the non-profit Metropolitan Opera Association, with Peter Gelb as general manager. As of 2018, the company's current music director is Yannick Nézet-Séguin.\nThe Met was founded in 1883 as an alternative to the previously established Academy of Music opera house and debuted the same year in a new building on 39th and Broadway (now known as the \"Old Met\"). It moved to the new Lincoln Center location in 1966.\nThe Metropolitan Opera is the largest classical music organization in North America. Until 2019, it presented about 27 different operas each year from late September through May. The operas are presented in a rotating repertory schedule, with up to seven performances of four different works staged each week. Performances are given in the evening Monday through Saturday with a matinée on Saturday. Several operas are presented in new productions each season. Sometimes these are borrowed from or shared with other opera companies. The rest of the year's operas are given in revivals of productions from previous seasons. The 2015–16 season comprised 227 performances of 25 operas.The operas in the Met's repertoire consist of a wide range of works, from 18th-century Baroque and 19th-century Bel canto to the Minimalism of the late 20th and 21st centuries. These operas are presented in staged productions that range in style from those with elaborate traditional decors to others that feature modern conceptual designs.\nThe Met's performing company consists of a large symphony orchestra, a chorus, children's choir, and many supporting and leading solo singers. The company also employs numerous free-lance dancers, actors, musicians and other performers throughout the season. The Met's roster of singers includes both international and American artists, some of whose careers have been developed through the Met's young artists programs. While many singers appear periodically as guests with the company, others maintain a close long-standing association with the Met, appearing many times each season until they retire.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:01:45.348636+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6026, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera"}], "uuid": "e078863c-10ee-4ce7-841b-dc3fe386d314", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "13420", "external_references": [{"id": 42993, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q10583424"}, {"id": 55245, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "126398520"}, {"id": 55246, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50074748"}, {"id": 55247, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50074748"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:01:48.141463+10:00"}

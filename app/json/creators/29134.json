Assayas is known for his slow-burning period pieces, psychological thrillers, neo-noirs and French comedies. He has frequently collaborated with Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart. The son of filmmaker Jacques Rémy, Assayas began his career as a critic for Cahiers du Cinéma. There he wrote about world cinema and its film auteurs, who later influenced his work. Assayas made several shorts, and then made the leap from writer to screenwriter.\nHe made his directorial film debut with Disorder in 1986. He continued directing films, with Cold Water (1994) a breakthrough film in his career. It was his first film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section. His followup film, Irma Vep (1996), also screened at Cannes, while Sentimental Destinies (2000), Demonlover (2002), and Clean (2004) all officially competed for the Palme d'Or. In 2006, he contributed a short film to the anthology film Paris, je t'aime (2006). He gained acclaim with his dramas Summer Hours (2008), Clouds of Sils Maria (2014) and Personal Shopper (2016); the latter won him the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director. He also directed the comedy Non-Fiction (2018) and the spy thriller Wasp Network (2019).\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:25:51.189380+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4800, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Assayas"}], "uuid": "e78ba153-462d-4ffa-99c6-0077b7c50d24", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25955", "external_references": [{"id": 25889, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q550717"}, {"id": 30579, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "66659497"}, {"id": 30580, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n92028917"}, {"id": 30581, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n92028917"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:41.232342+10:00"}

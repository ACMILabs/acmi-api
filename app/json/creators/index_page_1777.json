He won two Academy Awards; the first in 1957 for Best Documentary Short Subject (The True Story of the Civil War), and the second in 1963 for Best Documentary Feature (Black Fox: The Rise and Fall of Adolf Hitler).\nStoumen was born in Springtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and died in Sebastopol, California. After graduating from Lehigh University in 1939, he worked as a freelance journalist and photographer in New York. Many of the photographs of Times Square he made were published in the 1985 book Times Square: 45 Years of Photographs.Stoumen taught at UCLA Film School. He spoke of his innovation in The True Story of the Civil War. He invented a track for the camera to move back and forth over historic photos and paintings. It also tracked up and down (in and out). The technique is often referred to today as the \"Ken Burns effect\".Stoumen received Colin Higgins' master's thesis, a screenplay called Harold and Maude. Stoumen spoke of his enjoyment of the writing, but doubted it would ever be produced. He wasn't unhappy when proven wrong by the film's success.\nStouman married Lini De Vries in 1943; the couple divorced in 1949.\nAfter his death in 1991, the Stoumen Estate gifted the entire archive of Stoumen's work, including copyright, to the Museum of Photographic Arts. MOPA created a special exhibition and catalog entitled Seduced by Life: The Art of Lou Stoumen in celebration of acquiring the Stoumen Archive. Copyright for Stoumen's work is currently administered by the Museum of Photographic Arts.The Academy Film Archive preserved The True Story of the Civil War and T Is for Tumbleweed by Stoumen.",

"places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Merchant Ivory Productions is a film company founded in 1961 by producer Ismail Merchant (1936â€“2005) and director James Ivory (b. 1928). Merchant and Ivory were life and business partners from 1961 until Merchant's death in 2005. During their time together, they made 44 films. The films were for the most part produced by Merchant and directed by Ivory, and 23 of them were scripted by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (1927â€“2013) in some capacity. The films were often based upon novels or short stories, particularly the work of Henry James, E. M. Forster, and Jhabvala herself.\nThe initial goal of the company was \"to make English-language films in India aimed at the international market\". The style of Merchant Ivory films set and photographed in India became iconic. The company also went on to make films in the United Kingdom and America.Some actors and producers associated with Merchant Ivory include Maggie Smith, Leela Naidu, Madhur Jaffrey, Aparna Sen, Shashi Kapoor, Jennifer Kendal, Hugh Grant, James Wilby, Rupert Graves, Simon Callow, Anthony Hopkins, Glenn Close, Uma Thurman, Emma Thompson, Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson, Ralph Fiennes, Colin Firth, Richard Hawley and Helena Bonham Carter.Of this collaboration, Merchant once commented: \"It is a strange marriage we have at Merchant Ivory... I am an Indian Muslim, Ruth is a German Jew, and Jim is a Protestant American. Someone once described us as a three-headed god. Maybe they should have called us a three-headed monster!\"The expression \"Merchantâ€“Ivory film\" has made its way into common parlance, to denote a particular genre of film rather than the actual production company. While 1965's Shakespeare Wallah put this genre on the international map, its heyday was the 1980s and 1990s with such films as A Room with a View (1985) and Howards End (1992).  A typical \"Merchantâ€“Ivory film\" would be a period piece set in the early 20th century, usually in Edwardian England, featuring lavish sets and top British actors portraying genteel characters who suffer from disillusionment and tragic entanglements. The main theme often surrounded a house, which took on a particular importance in many Merchant Ivory films.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:11:54.015537+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4672, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Ivory_Productions"}], "uuid": "ab74a5e9-28e2-432b-a77b-04204e77a2f4", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4870", "external_references": [{"id": 26891, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2407366"}, {"id": 30268, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "147871981"}, {"id": 30269, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82249872"}, {"id": 30270, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82249872"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T16:11:54.041614+10:00"}, {"id": 18156, "name": "David Eastman", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2385672, "title": "Australian report", "work_id": 96329, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2385075, "title": "Surf Patrol", "work_id": 73396, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 825133, "title": "Australian diary.

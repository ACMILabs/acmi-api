Working across on- and offline modes of making, their expanded collage practice weaves together the old and the new to speak to potential futures. Drawing on humour, pop, sex, queer theory, history and iconography, their works are shrines to a post-truth era. They have exhibited extensively locally and internationally with recent projects including experimental live-streamed theatre, interactive media, AR, VR, performance and installation. In 2021, Xanthe developed new commissions for Sydney Opera House, Munch Museum, Bundoora Homestead and UQ Art Museum. In 2022, they worked on major projects for presentation at RISING Festival, The Museum of Contemporary Art, ACMI, The Lismore Regional Gallery and Grafton Regional Gallery. Xanthe is currently undertaking a PhD focusing on digital and interactive art at RMIT University.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:51:08.124956+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "25f1f8bd-4922-4f99-a267-6984d62e566a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40369", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:51:08.125203+10:00"}, {"id": 86498, "name": "Times Square", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394096, "title": "James Webb telescope in Times Square", "work_id": 120328, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:51:03.762115+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2e4a2f5c-ca72-4eda-a293-136495980fa9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40417", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:51:03.762439+10:00"}, {"id": 86497, "name": "@Rick42069", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394083, "title": "#MorbiusSweep", "work_id": 120102, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:50:47.128477+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "7e675dbf-1c63-4eb6-b039-12d9bf198f13", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40313", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:50:47.128815+10:00"}, {"id": 86496, "name": "@tacobelldollamenu", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394094, "title": "Tiktok responds to \"We Will Adopt Your Baby\"", "work_id": 120323, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:51:01.542399+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "8d8c76f2-8cbe-4cd8-8597-c076ac0ad3ce", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40403", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:51:01.542678+10:00"}, {"id": 86485, "name": "@Gutknot", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394095, "title": "Tractor Goth Girl", "work_id": 120324, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:51:02.698658+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c715de5b-795c-4f66-83c5-6723f246eb4e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40413", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:51:02.698972+10:00"}, {"id": 86484, "name": "Esmeralda", "roles_in_work": [], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "acb79c3e-1475-4e01-96d1-d9244ca07aa9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 86483, "name": "@NautPoso", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394093, "title": "Joe Biden takes a tumble", "work_id": 120321, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:51:00.450229+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "d5993310-16f5-4def-a116-4009e8f2e500", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40399", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:51:00.450594+10:00"}, {"id": 86482, "name": "Steven Rhall", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2105550, "title": "Avert", "work_id": 120316, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Steven Rhall is a post-conceptual artist operating from a First Nation, white-passing, queer, cis male positionality, geographically located on neighbouring Woiwurrung and Wathaurung lands. Rhall’s cultural background consists of Taungurung and colonial heritages – a state endemic to living in a colonised society – but goes by Taungurung when asked. His alter-ego Blak Metal is less defined and uses they/them pronouns.\n\nRhall’s art practice finds expression in ideas of institutional critique, interrogating modes of representation, classification and hierarchy both within and external to the art world(s). He works across various forms and interventions, including installation, performance, process led methodologies, curatorial projects, sculpture and art within the public realm. Many of his projects propose, explore and critique the exchange of economic and cultural capital found in the matrix of relations and intersections of First Nation art production, presentation and encounter.\n\nRhall recently concluded a five year tenure as lecturer for the Master of Contemporary Art programme at the Victorian College of the Arts and now, alongside his art practice, supports First Nations participants in the Statewide Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community Program. Rhall is also represented by MARS Gallery on Birrarung-ga land (Melbourne, Australia).", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T12:38:09.899237+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "706257c1-8f4c-4542-a547-ce3858f4f2b9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40387", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 86481, "name": "@Cmebacktoearth", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394092, "title": "Max floating to songs", "work_id": 120311, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:50:59.366665+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "fe45413f-4761-439c-bc1c-6f64901e8294", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40384", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:50:59.366902+10:00"}, {"id": 86436, "name": "@paharikawa Pahari", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2394091, "title": "TikTokker, Aslan Pahari, satirical take on the depiction of non-white characters in mainstream films", "work_id": 120295, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "@paharikawa", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T10:50:58.246025+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9c32d525-a88c-4443-8a60-c4e5b3360934", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40373", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-09T10:50:58.246280+10:00"}]}

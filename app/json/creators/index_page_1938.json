He was the son of a leading French actor, Lucien Guitry, and followed his father into the theatrical profession. He became known for his stage performances, particularly in boulevardier roles. He was also a prolific playwright, writing 115 plays throughout his career. He was married five times, always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered. Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932.\nGuitry's plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including André Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.\nThe later years of Guitry's career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War. The charges were dismissed, but Guitry, a strongly patriotic man, was disillusioned by the vilification he received from some of his compatriots. By the time of his death, his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:59:54.060993+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3047, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Guitry"}], "uuid": "0e0670ae-f5f5-473f-ab89-95a83941d8b2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28426", "external_references": [{"id": 12930, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q337276"}, {"id": 12931, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "14770929"}, {"id": 12932, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50018815"}, {"id": 12933, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50018815"}], "date_modified": "2025-05-22T22:51:54.781669+10:00"}, {"id": 23660, "name": "Clement Duhour", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1985711, "title": "Napoleon", "work_id": 81413, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3104463, "title": "Si Versailles M'etait Conte = Affairs in Versailles", "work_id": 115925, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Denis Clément Duhour", "date_of_birth": "1911-12-11", "date_of_death": "1983-01-03", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 4, "name": "French", "slug": "french"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "biography": "Clément Duhour was born in Saint-Jean d’Anglet, in the Aquitaine region of south-western France on 11 December 1912.

Based in Atlanta, Georgia, it merged with Time Warner (later WarnerMedia) on October 10, 1996. As of April 2022, all of its assets are now owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). The headquarters of Turner's properties are largely located at the CNN Center in Downtown Atlanta, and the Turner Broadcasting campus off Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta, which also houses Turner Studios. Some of their operations are housed within WBD's corporate and global headquarters inside 30 Hudson Yards in Manhattan's West Side district, and at 230 Park Avenue South in Midtown Manhattan, both in New York City, respectively.\nTurner is known for several pioneering innovations in U.S. multichannel television, including its satellite uplink of local Atlanta independent station WTCG channel 17 as TBS—one of the first national \"superstations\", and its establishment of the Cable News Network (CNN)—the first 24-hour news channel. It later launched a sister cable network, TNT, professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the children's channel Cartoon Network, and the movie channel Turner Classic Movies (TCM). Turner South—a network devoted to regional sports and southern lifestyle programming—was launched by Turner in 1999, but was later sold to Fox Sports Networks in 2006 to form SportSouth. The same year, it acquired Liberty Media's stake in their joint venture Court TV. WCW assets were later sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 2001.\nOn June 14, 2018, Time Warner, including Turner Broadcasting System, was acquired by telecom firm AT&T and re-branded WarnerMedia. After the purchase, \"Turner\" was phased out as a corporate brand, and on March 4, 2019, its properties were dispersed into either WarnerMedia Entertainment (TBS, TNT, and TruTV), WarnerMedia News & Sports (CNN, Turner Sports, and AT&T SportsNet), or brought directly under Warner Bros. (Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Turner Classic Movies). On August 10, 2020, the WarnerMedia Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment assets were merged to form WarnerMedia Studios & Networks Group.As of 2020, AT&T reported the financial results for WarnerMedia's ad-supported cable networks under the Turner business unit, while also using the term \"the TNets\" to refer to the group of TBS, TNT, and TruTV in press releases.

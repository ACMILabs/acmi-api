During the early to mid-20th century, he was one of the most famous and successful Australian comedians on both stage and screen, with screen, song and revue sketch writing amongst his repertoire. Wallace was a small tubby man with goggle eyes, a mobile face and croaky voice who appeared in trademark baggy trousers, checkered shirt and felt hat. His career as one of Australia's most popular comedians spanned four decades from the 1920s to 1960 and encompassed stage, radio and film entertainment. Ken G. Hall, who directed him in two films, wrote in his autobiography that George Wallace was the finest Australian comedian he had known.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:07:09.959765+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5837, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace_(Australian_comedian)"}], "uuid": "36dc28bf-e67c-4a43-81f0-5c88f20b9281", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38155", "external_references": [{"id": 43515, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1508292"}, {"id": 54516, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "6611739"}, {"id": 54517, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n93095784"}, {"id": 54518, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n93095784"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:07:09.982008+10:00"}

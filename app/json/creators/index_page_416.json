She was nominated for 13 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning five times, and was the recipient of several other accolades, such as the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She earned many honors, including the Women in Film Crystal Award, an induction into the Television Hall of Fame, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kennedy Center Honors, and the Governors Award from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\nBall's career began in 1929 when she landed work as a model. Shortly thereafter, she began her performing career on Broadway using the stage name Diane (or Dianne) Belmont. She later appeared in films in the 1930s and 1940s as a contract player for RKO Radio Pictures, being cast as a chorus girl or in similar roles, with lead roles in B-pictures and supporting roles in A-pictures. During this time, she met Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz, and they eloped in November 1940. In the 1950s, Ball ventured into television, where she and Arnaz created the sitcom I Love Lucy. She gave birth to their first child, Lucie, in 1951, followed by Desi Arnaz Jr. in 1953. They divorced in March 1960, and she married comedian Gary Morton in 1961.Ball produced and starred in the Broadway musical Wildcat from 1960 to 1961. In 1962, she became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu Productions, which produced many popular television series, including Mission: Impossible and Star Trek. After Wildcat, she reunited with I Love Lucy co-star Vivian Vance for The Lucy Show, which Vance left in 1965. The show continued, with Ball's longtime friend and series regular Gale Gordon, until 1968. Ball immediately began appearing in a new series, Here's Lucy, with Gordon, frequent show guest Mary Jane Croft, and Lucie and Desi Jr.; this program ran until 1974.\nBall did not retire from acting completely, and in 1985 she took on a dramatic role in the television film Stone Pillow. The next year she starred in Life with Lucy, which, unlike her other sitcoms, was not well-received; it was canceled after three months. She did not appear in film or television roles for the rest of her career and died in 1989 from an abdominal aortic aneurysm and arteriosclerotic heart disease at the age of 77.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:59:47.431269+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4573, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball"}], "uuid": "03b8861f-ae35-49ea-94ad-7ab68d7ec6ae", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31668", "external_references": [{"id": 25261, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q209662"}, {"id": 30013, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "34646030"}, {"id": 30014, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n80043347"}, {"id": 30015, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n80043347"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:33:33.709164+10:00"}, {"id": 81336, "name": "Betty Grable", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2245514, "title": "Follow the fleet", "work_id": 95436, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1916-12-18", "date_of_death": "1973-07-02", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Elizabeth Ruth Grable (December 18, 1916 – July 2, 1973) was an American actress, pin-up girl, dancer, model, and singer.\nHer 42 films during the 1930s and 1940s grossed more than $100 million; for 10 consecutive years (1942–1951) she reigned in the Quigley Poll's top 10 box office stars (a feat only matched by Doris Day, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand, although all were surpassed by Mary Pickford, who was in for 13 times). The U.S. Treasury Department in 1946 and 1947 listed her as the highest-salaried American woman; she earned more than $3 million during her career.Grable began her film career in 1929 at age 12, after which she was fired from a contract when it was learned she signed up under false identification. She had contracts with RKO and Paramount Pictures during the 1930s, and appeared in a string of B movies, mostly portraying college students. Grable came to prominence in the Broadway musical DuBarry Was a Lady (1939), which brought her to the attention of 20th Century-Fox.She replaced Alice Faye in Down Argentine Way (1940), her first major Hollywood film, and became Fox's biggest film star throughout the next decade. Fox cast Grable in a succession of Technicolor musicals during the decade that were immensely popular, co-starring with such leading men as Victor Mature, Don Ameche, John Payne, and Tyrone Power. In 1943, she was the number-one box office draw in the world and, in 1947, she was the highest-paid entertainer in the United States. Two of her bigger film successes were the musical Mother Wore Tights (1947) and the comedy How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), one of her later films. Grable retired from screen acting in 1955 after she withdrew from her Fox contract, but she continued to perform on the stage and on television.Throughout her career, Grable was a celebrated sex symbol. Her bathing suit poster made her the number-one pin-up girl of World War II, surpassing Rita Hayworth. It was later included in the Life magazine project \"100 Photographs That Changed the World\". Hosiery specialists of the era often noted the ideal proportions of her legs and thighs (18.5 in (47 cm)), calf (12 in (30 cm)), and ankle (7.5 in (19 cm)). Grable's legs were insured by her studio for $1 million as a publicity stunt. Describing her film career, Grable said \"I became a star for two reasons, and I'm standing on them.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:12:28.051283+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3645, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Grable"}], "uuid": "35acf53c-0c74-40ae-aac6-71627d71574d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33687", "external_references": [{"id": 25224, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q233852"}, {"id": 27504, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "9956367"}, {"id": 27505, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81050347"}, {"id": 27506, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81050347"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:01:22.757466+10:00"}, {"id": 81335, "name": "Marvin Hamlisch", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2347142, "title": "The Entertainer", "work_id": 95434, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Marvin Frederick Hamlisch", "date_of_birth": "1944-06-02", "date_of_death": "2012-08-06", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Marvin Frederick Hamlisch (June 2, 1944 – August 6, 2012) was an American composer and conductor.

By atomising and reassembling recorded culture they aim to manufacture counter-mythologies of the past that open new possibilities for thinking the present. This conceptual strategy also informs their practical methodology where sampling becomes a means of synthesising space-times to create alternate historical realities, producing a form of radical historiography that merges research, documentary and speculative fiction.\n\nWorking together since 2002, Soda_Jerk is a collaboration between sisters Dan and Dominique Angeloro. They are based in Berlin and Sydney.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T12:25:29.974853+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "6c1895e0-54dc-48a1-96d6-6c4b54d0fc5b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35579", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:29.975196+11:00"}

Through metaphor, provocation and association, Kobland often explores the historical meaning, critical context, and received notions of a particular site or place. He writes, \"I 'dream' a place .... The work is principally about reflecting on the meaning of a site; historically, psychically, and physically. It?s about the saturation of place. The place in our heads and the place on the ground.\" Kobland is currently working on a new film/video work, Who Writes Remains, and a collaborative feature film project with The Wooster Group.\n\nKen Kobland was born in New York in 1946. He studied at Columbia University School of Architecture and Union College. Since 1975 he has worked with the Wooster Group. Kobland has received awards and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; the New York Foundation on the Arts; the D.A.A.D.

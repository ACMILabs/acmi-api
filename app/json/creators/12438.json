She first came to notice with Smithereens (1982), the earliest American independent feature to be screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival. Her next feature, Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), co-starred Madonna in her first film, and was named as one of 100 greatest films directed by women by the BBC; it resulted in a Cesar Award nomination. She-Devil (1989) starred Meryl Streep in her first starring comedic film role and Roseanne Barr in her first feature-film role. Her work on the short film The Dutch Master resulted in an Academy Award nomination. Seidelman's subsequent films mix comedy with drama, blending genres and pop-cultural references with a focus on women protagonists, particularly outsiders. She also works in television and directed the pilot episode of Sex and the City.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:13:19.869772+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5228, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Seidelman"}], "uuid": "7c716820-1e75-4468-8f99-5673ea1ab283", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29357", "external_references": [{"id": 25704, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q270372"}, {"id": 31700, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "54334944"}, {"id": 31701, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no98079531"}, {"id": 31702, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no98079531"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T17:13:38.688543+10:00"}

One of Stephen's first works in 1975 was made with an audio synthesiser being fed into an oscilliscope that traced and layered the patterns of the sounds. He built his first `real' video synthesiser in 1979. In 1982 he established the highly influential post-production facility Heuristic Video and began his ten-year association as videomaker for the music group Severed Heads.\n\nIn providing technical support for numerous performance and video artists (including Nam June Paik and Charlotte Moorman) he has developed a range of techniques using the Fairlight CVI, the conjure computer graphics system and the Amiga computer.\n\nJones is particularly interested in organisation and self-regulating systems along with developing a visual language to communicate complex ideas.For the past twenty-five years Jones has been copnducting research into the relationship between neuroscience and the nature of consciousness, culminating in The Brain Project, a web site which has been in development since 1996.\n\nJones is the recipient of an Australia Council Fellowship, through the New Media Arts Fund. He now works as a consultant electronic engineer and builder of video studios.\n\nReferences:\nDead Eyes Opened , 1982-85, colour, sound, ? min\nHot with Fleas , 1986-87, colour, sound, ? min\nThe Brain Project , 1996, web site\nBibliography:\nMazurek, Amy An Interview with Stephen Jones and Tom Ellard, March 1994\nVideos by Severed Heads http://www.sevcom.com/video.htm", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:10:31.402471+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c557da05-6e45-4f4e-a2c1-17dece84b460", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110064", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6494, "name": "Ohio State University", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2241033, "title": "Fire of time", "work_id": 107974, "role": "support", "role_id": 492, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 850405, "title": "Developmental evaluation in infancy", "work_id": 66756, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 881934, "title": "Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse", "work_id": 92957, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:53:44.930946+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f02e5a78-e174-4881-96b5-24538369845e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110495", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6483, "name": "Peter Hennessey", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2264275, "title": "Screen Gallery scaling visualisation", "work_id": 107973, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2140090, "title": "Closer", "work_id": 108388, "role": "interface design", "role_id": 574, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 727568, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 727569, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 727570, "title": "Making Chunky Move: C.O.R.R.U.P.T.E.D. 2", "work_id": 107994, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039645, "title": "My Woomera Project (What do you fear?)", "work_id": 109439, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1968", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Peter Hennessey is an artist whose work encompasses sculpture, video and interactive media.

"places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Born in 1951, Bill Viola is a major figure in video art. His installations and videotapes, which have received international recognition, are distinguished by a confluence of allegorical resonance and virtuosic control of technology. Viola explores video's temporal and optical systems to metaphorically examine modes of perception and cognition, and ultimately chart a symbolic quest for self. Employing a rigorous structuralism, a ritualized investigation of visual and acoustic phenomena, illusion and reality, he achieves a poetic articulation of visionary transcendence. \"Visual poems, allegories in the language of subjective perception,\" is how Viola terms his videotapes, which include such major works as Chott el-Djerid (1979); Hatsu Yume (First Dream) (1981); and I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like (1986).\n\nLight and time are the essential materials with which Viola conducts his metaphysical, at times spiritual search to know and define the self. Rendered plastic, they are used to define a symbolic language of the unconscious and consciousness, microcosm and macrocosm, inner and outer landscapes. Unfolding without spoken language, infused with emblematic transformations and archetypal images, his works suggest subconscious dreams or pre-lingual memories. Viola's extraordinary use of video technology to \"sculpt\" with time is one of his few \"special effects.\" Time-lapse, slow motion, reversals, duration and other temporal interventions acquire metaphorical significance, evoking cycles of day and night, birth, life, death and renewal.\n\nThis unique exploration of technological systems to articulate transcendent perceptions reflects a convergence of eclectic influences: musical principles; the philosophies and rituals of non-Western cultures; Judeo-Christian mysticism; modernism and Romanticism; the natural and animal worlds; structuralist film; and the television and media world of his self-described \"seven-channel childhood.\"\n\nViola's presence is always manifested in images or reflections of himself. In early, performance-based exercises, including Migration (1976) and The Space Between the Teeth (1976), Viola began a systematic mapping of specific optical devices -- macro lens, the zoom -- to explore modes of seeing and perceiving reflections of the self. With The Reflecting Pool (1977-80), which describes \"the stages of a personal journey through images of transition,\" Viola employs increasingly sophisticated manipulations of time and light as metaphysical constructs. Astonishing alterations and transformations of reality and representation disrupt the viewer's expectations of visual and temporal causality.\n\nOne of the culminating expressions of Viola's artistic project, I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like (1986) unfolds as an epic quest for transcendence and self-knowledge through a symbolic rendering of animal and spiritual consciousness. This highly allegorical work includes a vision that is emblematic of Viola's artistic project: a self-image reflected in an owl's eye.\n\nViola is best known for his significant body of work in multi-media installation, in which he extends his symbolic language of images and sound into dramatic, theatrical articulations.\n\nViola was born in 1951. He received a B.F.A. from the College of Visual and Performing Arts, Syracuse University, in 1973. While there, he was an instrumental participant in the Synapse Video Center, one of the first alternative media centers in New York State. In 1973, he and several musicians formed the Composers Inside Electronics Group; in 1975, he became technical director of Art/Tapes/22, an artists' production studio in Florence, Italy. From 1976 until 1980, Viola was artist-in- residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York; he was artist-in-residence at the Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Japan, in 1980.\n\nViola has received numerous awards, including a United States/Japan Exchange Fellowship in 1980; a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1982; a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1985; the Polaroid Video Art Award in 1985; National Endowment for the Arts awards in 1978, 1983, 1986, and 1989; and the American Film Institute's Maya Deren Award for Independent Film and Video in 1987. In 1989, he was the recipient of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award.\n\nViola's videotapes and installations have been shown widely throughout the world, in major group exhibitions at festivals and institutions including Kolnischer Kunstverein, Cologne; Documenta VI, Kassel, Germany; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; and the Venice Biennale. He has also had one-person shows at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; ARC/Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; and the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, among other institutions. Bill Viola was chosen to represent the United States at the 46th Venice Biennale, which is the oldest and most reknowned international contemporary arts festival. Five video and sound installations were created specifically by Viola for the Bienniale's United States Pavillion. He was the subject of a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Amerian Art in 1998.\n\nViola lives in Long Beach, California.\n\nReferences:\nInformation, 1973, 30 min, color, sound\nRed Tape -- Collected Works, 1975, 30 min, color, sound\nPlaying Soul Music to My Freckles, 2:46 min.\nA Non-Dairy Creamer, 5:19 min.\nThe Semi-Circular Canals, 8:51 min.\nA Million Other Things (2), 4:35 min.\nReturn, 7:15 min.\nFour Songs, 1976, 33 min, color, sound\nJunkyard Levitation, 3:11 min.\nSongs of Innocence, 9:34 min.\nThe Space Between the Teeth, 9:10 min.\nTruth Through Mass Individuation, 10:13 min.\nHe Weeps for You, 1976, installation: video, sound,\nMigration, 1976, 7 min, color, sound\nMemories of Ancestral Power (The Moro Movement in the Solomon Islands), 1977, 35:19 min, color, sound\nMemory Surfaces and Mental Prayers, 1977, 29 min, color, sound\nThe Wheel of Becoming, 7:40 min.\nThe Morning After the Night of Power, 10:44 min.\nSweet Light, 9:08 min.\nPalm Trees on the Moon, 1977, 26:06 min, color, sound\nThe Reflecting Pool - Collected Work, 1977-79, 62 min, color, sound\nThe Reflecting Pool, 1977-79, 7 min.\nMoonblood, 1977-79, 12:48 min.\nSilent Life, 1979, 13:14 min.\nAncient of Days, 1979-81, 12:21 min.\nVegetable Memory, 1978-80, 15:13 min.\nChott el-Djerid (A Portrait in Light and Heat), 1979, 28 min, color, sound\nSodium Vapor (including Constellation and Oracle), 1979, released 1986, 14:41 min, color, sound\nHatsu Yume (First Dream), 1981, 56 min, colour, sound\nAnthem, 1983, 11:30 min, color, sound\nReasons for Knocking at an Empty House, 1982, installation: video, sound, 19:11 min\nRoom for St. John of the Cross, 1983, installation: video, sound,\nReverse Television -- Portraits of Viewers (Compilation Tape), 1984, 15 min, color, sound\nI Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like, 1986, 89 min, colour, sound\nThe Passage, 1987, installation: video, sound\nThe Sleep of Reason, 1988, installation: video, sound\nAngel's Gate, 1989, 4:50 min, color, sound\nThe Passing, 1991, 54:13 min, b&w, sound\nThe Stopping Mind, 1991, installation: video, sound\nSlowly Turning Narrative, 1992, installation: video, sound\nThe Sleepers, 1992, installation: video, sound\nThe Greeting, 1992, installation: video, sound\nHeaven and Earth, 1992, installation: video, sound\nNantes Triptych, 1992, Video and mixed media\nTiny Deaths, 1993, installation: video, sound\nDeserts, 1994, 26 min, color, sound\nThe Veiling, 1995, installation: video, sound\nThe Crossing, 1996, installation: video, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:41:53.625798+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b79676ad-efeb-43d0-98b7-8e78ecf7da1a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110058", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

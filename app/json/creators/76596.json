He was a film critic for Time magazine from 1965–2010, and also wrote for Life magazine and the Los Angeles Times Book Review. His last writings about film were for Truthdig.\nHe was interviewed in For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism (2009). In this documentary film, he discusses early film critics Frank E. Woods, Robert E. Sherwood, and Otis Ferguson, and tells of how, in the 1960s, he, Pauline Kael, and Andrew Sarris, rejected moralizing opposition of the older Bosley Crowther of The New York Times who had railed against violent movies such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967). In addition to film, Schickel also critiqued and documented cartoons, particularly Peanuts.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T00:33:04.982336+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6131, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel"}], "uuid": "44c65164-8855-41fa-8860-e3da131e44e0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "119", "external_references": [{"id": 36836, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1454098"}, {"id": 55635, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "85917837"}, {"id": 55636, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50016081"}, {"id": 55637, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50016081"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T00:22:00.673926+11:00"}

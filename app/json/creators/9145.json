At VCA he extended the use of interactivity to explore photography, a medium which he was formally trained in. There, he wrote and directed Multiple Xposure, an interactive CD Rom that explores a photographer with multiple personalties through the perception of dance, live action, photographic images and soundscape. The CD Rom has exhibited in shows from Melbourne, America to Japan.\n\nHis work primarily deals with human behaviour. In 2000, he continued working with the performing arts industry. As a producer and director, he extracted elements from the CD Rom and transformed Multiple Xposure into a multimedia dance performance titled LUCID. It was performed to a full house at Revolver Upstairs for Melbourne Fringe Festival. LUCID deals with the issues in religious beliefs, homosexuality, violence and psychology. Again he worked with composer Brett Aplin who composed the soundscape to Multiple Xposure. LUCID received rave reviews and was awarded Melbourne Fringe Movement Award for Definition of New Boundaries. LUCID was also performed at St Kilda Film Festival Fusion at The George Ballroom, St Kilda in 2001.\n\nHe was commissioned by David Pledger from Not Yet Its Difficult to work on his play titled ¿K¿, a theatrical piece using projected images interacting with the actors about surveillance. It was performed at Melbourne Theatre Company.\n\nEdmund has also worked with Australian Dance Theatre for the annual season of\nIgnition in 2001. He collaborated with Lina Limosani (choreographer of Multiple Xposure) with animated visuals to ¿It¿s not for me¿, a piece about violence and religion. It was performed at ADT days before the September 11 incident.\n\nIn 2002, Edmund completed his Master of Multimedia at Monash University and is currently working in Sydney as an advertising photographer.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:44:13.840649+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "5876c61e-35b7-49ef-ad5f-23c213fc5227", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "112024", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:44:13.841001+11:00"}

Collaborative and future-focused, APHIDS is led by Co-Directors Lara Thoms and Mish Grigor with Executive Producer Anna Nalpantidis. The work of APHIDS is feminist, intersectional, angry, and funny; we bring artists into meaningful exchange with audiences through performance, screens, critical dialogue, and unpredictable encounters in the public realm.\n\nPast APHIDS works have been presented in major venues in every state and territory in Australia, and in more unexpected places: Elderly homes in Finland, industrial zones in Bulgaria, Union headquarters and beamed into outer space. Our collaborators have included funeral directors, Uber drivers, scientists, and pop stars. Our projects promote open, accessible yet complex and rigorous encounters between artists and the public.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T08:38:19.542425+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9ca90fff-35f8-4e48-94c4-2682a3841f30", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40540", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T08:38:19.542742+11:00"}

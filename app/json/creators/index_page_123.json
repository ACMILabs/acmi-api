He spent his early years (6-17 years), at 17 Eggham Road, West Ham. George started work at 14 in London as a messenger boy taking telegrams around the streets of London.\n\nAt 15 years of age George joined the British merchant navy like his father.\nHe served on his first vessel as a deck boy and sailed to South America.\nAt 17 years of age he sailed to China and Japan and his last vessel was the SS Ascianius. He paid off on 10/12/1928 in Melbourne at 18 years of age.\n\nIn Melbourne, George met Sybil. Sybil was impressed by the Englishman who travelled the world and had such wonderful dreams for the future and seemed so worldly wise compared to the country boys she knew from Warrandyte.\n\nGeorge and Sybil married in Richmond in April 1937, after 5 years of courtship, - but not until after George had worked hard to bring out both his sister and his mother to join him in Australia. In those early years, George worked at Kraft Foods and was encouraged to go to night school to complete his Electrical Contractors A Grade Certificate.\n\nHelen and John were born in 1940 and 1942.  George joined the RAAF 35th Squadron in June 1942.  George was based overseas as an electrical engineer in Moratai, an island off New Guinea. He serviced aircraft when they returned to base.\nGeorge never spoke much about his wartime experiences, however, he never forgot bringing back prisoners of war from Changi prison after peace was declared. George was discharged on 19 December 1945.\n\nRuth and Janet were born after the war and all the family remember the wonderful days in North Balwyn where they grew up. Every summer in those early years, was spent at Wye River with immediate family, cousins Delaneys and other friends, camping and surfing on boards made by George.\n\nGeorge and Sybil travelled throughout their marriage, and for their first big trip in1959 they sold the family home in North Balwyn and heading for England – “home”, as it still was to George. The family sailed on The SS Orontes.\n\nThe family returned to Australia in 1960 after 2 years away.\n\nIt has been said that the best thing a man could do for his children is to love their mother and George never stopped doing that. He gave his family a wonderful start in life. George was optimistic, happy and enthusiastic. He encouraged his family to give everything their best shot and applauded all their achievements. George taught his children that hard work would generally bring good results. George believed that having fun was very important and nothing was too much trouble if everyone had a good time. George lived a full life up until his death at 96 years of age. Watching the family movies he had made was a favourite past time in those latter years.\nSource: Ruth Hargrave (nee Malin) daughter of George.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-07-05T03:57:11.005282+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "7574cbde-96b9-484f-8fe9-9ec939d39ff5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38736", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-07-05T03:57:11.005649+10:00"}, {"id": 84300, "name": "ACMI Collections", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2059212, "title": "[Remix: Sunnies]", "work_id": 117828, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2059192, "title": "[Remix: Hats]", "work_id": 117829, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2374546, "title": "[Remix: The Races]", "work_id": 119311, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2374540, "title": "[Remix: Strike A Pose]", "work_id": 119293, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2681352, "title": "[Remix: Victorian Road Signs]", "work_id": 119316, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2684903, "title": "[Remix: Tennis]", "work_id": 119305, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2684899, "title": "[Remix: Women in science and technology]", "work_id": 119317, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2681354, "title": "[Remix: Summer beaches and pools]", "work_id": 119302, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2393180, "title": "[Remix: Historic Melbourne]", "work_id": 119320, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2686421, "title": "[Remix: Transport]", "work_id": 119318, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-09T04:26:09.566973+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "01af806d-1199-4c82-8a6c-eb77a1a31c76", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35589", "external_references": [{"id": 33208, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121086058"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:20:17.719084+11:00"}, {"id": 84299, "name": "Dorothy Nixon", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2517439, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 4]", "work_id": 119164, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517441, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 5]", "work_id": 119165, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517443, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 6]", "work_id": 117825, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517445, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 7]", "work_id": 119166, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517447, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 8]", "work_id": 117826, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517449, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 9]", "work_id": 119167, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517451, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 10]", "work_id": 117827, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517453, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movie Collection]", "work_id": 119161, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517433, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 1]", "work_id": 117823, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517435, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 2]", "work_id": 117824, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2517437, "title": "[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 3]", "work_id": 119163, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "18 JUN 1936", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-07-05T03:57:04.573593+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2850c378-5e53-4e49-aec1-c021d82933c2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38923", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2024-04-17T04:06:17.544045+10:00"}]}

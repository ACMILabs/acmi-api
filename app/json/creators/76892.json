Joffe (July 16, 1929 â€“ July 9, 2008) was an American film producer and comedy talent manager. He is best known as, in partnership with Jack Rollins, the producer or executive producer of most of Woody Allen's films. Joffe won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Picture as producer of Allen's Annie Hall.\n\nAnnie Hall was listed as \"A Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe Production\", though only Joffe took producer credit and received the Academy Award for Best Picture. Both were Allen's longtime managers and had that credit on all his films from 1969 to 1993. Joffe focused more on Allen, with Rollins focusing on others. Their clients also included Robert Klein and David Letterman.

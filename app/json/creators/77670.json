His career had three major genres: Hollywood films, jazz, and classical music. In each he achieved success, and the latter two were part of his life until the end. In movies, he arranged and composed music. In jazz, he was a celebrated trio pianist, a piano-accompanist to singers of standards, and pianist-interpreter of songs from the \"Great American Songbook\". In classical music, he also performed as a pianist but gained television fame as a conductor, and during his last thirty years created his legacy as a composer of art music.\nBefore the age of twenty, Previn began arranging and composing for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He would go on to be involved in the music of more than fifty films and would win four Academy Awards. He won ten Grammy Awards, for recordings in all three areas of his career, and then one more, for lifetime achievement. He served as music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra (1967–1969), principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (1968–1979), music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (1976–1984), of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1985–1989), chief conductor of the Royal Philharmonic (1985–1992), and, after an avowed break from salaried posts, chief conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic (2002–2006). He also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:34:15.058819+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5675, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Previn"}], "uuid": "9b74a68e-b1c2-4d71-9dfd-762e61eedc9d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38186", "external_references": [{"id": 33709, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q155712"}, {"id": 53950, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "110759893"}, {"id": 53951, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50027472"}, {"id": 53952, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50027472"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:34:17.660181+10:00"}

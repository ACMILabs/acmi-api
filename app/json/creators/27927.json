His films combine fantasy, realism, and science fiction to create idealized realities or to give relevance to mundane situations.\nJeunet debuted as a director with the acclaimed 1991 black comedy Delicatessen, collaborating with Marc Caro.  Jeunet then co-wrote and -directed with Caro again on The City of Lost Children (1995). His work with science fiction and horror led him to become the fourth director to helm the Alien film series with Alien Resurrection (1997), his first and thus far only experience with an American film. In 2001, Jeunet achieved his biggest success with the release of Amélie, which won him international acclaim; the film reached BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.Jeunet is widely regarded as one of the most influential and important directors in modern French cinema, and his critical and commercial success has earned him two Academy Award nominations.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:25:59.970303+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4288, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Jeunet"}], "uuid": "480ece5c-8224-4554-a9f0-467eaffd76d0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21615", "external_references": [{"id": 26226, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q217324"}, {"id": 29267, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "74776865"}, {"id": 29268, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr98036966"}, {"id": 29269, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr98036966"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T11:19:49.107730+10:00"}

The university's main campus is in Perth, the state capital. UWA was established in 1911 by an act of the Parliament of Western Australia.UWA is the oldest university in the state of Western Australia (WA) and is the sixth-oldest university in Australia. Because of its age and reputation, UWA is classed as one of the \"sandstone universities\", an informal designation given to the oldest university in each state. \nUWA is a member of the prestigious Group of Eight, which consists of the eight most research intensive and best ranked Australian universities. UWA is also a member of the international Matariki Network of Universities. \nUWA is ranked in the world's top 100 universities, according to several highly respected publications. Another defining characteristic of UWA is that it has retained its Convocation as an integral part of its governance structure. All graduates of UWA are automatically life-long members of the university through Convocation which grants them the right to attend the Annual General Meetings, to elect two members of the UWA Senate and to review any changes to University legislation. \nGraduates of UWA include Prime Minister of Australia (Bob Hawke), five Justices of the High Court of Australia (including Chief Justice, Robert French, now Chancellor), Governor of the Reserve Bank (H. C. Coombs), various federal cabinet ministers, and seven of Western Australia's eight most recent premiers. In 2018 alumnus mathematician Akshay Venkatesh was a recipient of the Fields Medal. As of 2021, the university had produced 106 Rhodes Scholars. Two members of the UWA faculty, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won Nobel Prizes as a result of research at the university.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T02:01:41.559715+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6237, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia"}], "uuid": "1b1eec88-b265-4854-be99-8603221a196f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4431", "external_references": [{"id": 51144, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1517021"}, {"id": 56016, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "146292670"}, {"id": 56017, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79089340"}, {"id": 56018, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79089340"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:01:48.468531+10:00"}

American actor, director, and singer. Perkins played the role of Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense thriller Psycho, which made him an influential figure in pop culture and in horror films.\nBorn in New York City, Perkins got his start as an adolescent in summer stock programs, although he acted in films before he set foot on a Broadway stage. His first film, The Actress, costarring Spencer Tracy and Jean Simmons and directed by George Cukor, was a disappointment save for an Oscar nod for its costumes, and Perkins returned to the boards instead. He made his Broadway debut in the Elia Kazan-directed Tea and Sympathy where he played Tom Lee, a \"sissy\" cured by the right woman. He was praised for the role, and after it closed, he turned to Hollywood once more, starring in Friendly Persuasion (1956) with Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, which earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best New Actor of the Year and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Rushes of the film led to Perkins landing a seven-year, semi-exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures. He was their last matinee idol.\nPerkins went on to appear in Fear Strikes Out the following year. Paramount was concerned with heterosexualizing Perkins's image, which led to a string of romantic roles alongside Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, and Shirley MacLaine. He was able to score the occasional serious role in the Broadway play Look Homeward, Angel (for which he was nominated for a Tony Award) and the 1959 film On the Beach with Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire, and Ava Gardner. Although he was once again cast as a romantic lead in Jane Fonda's film debut, Tall Story, he was shortly thereafter cast as Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), which established him as a horror icon and garnered him a Bambi Award nomination for Best Actor, as well as both a Best Actor nomination and a win from the International Board of Motion Picture Reviewers. His  work in the 1960 horror-thriller also led to his being typecast, and in order to escape the same villainous roles, Perkins bought himself out of his Paramount contract and moved to France, where he debuted in European film with Goodbye Again (1961). The film earned him a Best Actor Bravo Otto nomination, a second career Bambi nomination, as well as his winning the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a Best Actor David di Donatello award.\nAfter European films featuring Sophia Loren, Orson Welles, Melina Mercouri, and Brigitte Bardot, Perkins returned to America in 1968 with his first American film after an eight-year absence, Pretty Poison. He costarred with Tuesday Weld. In the film's wake, he starred in commercially and critically successful films, such as Catch-22 (1970), Play It as It Lays (1972), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), and Mahogany (1975). During this time, Perkins went through conversion therapy and married Berry Berenson in 1973. He reprised his role as Norman Bates in Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986) and Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990). His turn in the 1986 entry of the anthology earned Perkins a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actor. Additionally, he was involved in numerous television excursions. His last film, In the Deep Woods, was a television film broadcast a month after his death in September 1992 from AIDS-related causes.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:41:53.485567+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5684, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Perkins"}], "uuid": "c46a30a0-0a06-4cfa-b291-59fc75a78af4", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35334", "external_references": [{"id": 33889, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q193146"}, {"id": 53972, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117496191"}, {"id": 53973, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n90704435"}, {"id": 53974, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n90704435"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:41:56.375734+10:00"}]}

Media dance is work that is created directly for the camera. While Atlas’ primary artistic medium is video, he also began to experiment with live electronic performance in 2003. Atlas worked collaboratively with Merce Cunningham from 1975 to 1981. Before his time as the Cunningham company’s filmmaker-in-residence (1978 – 1983), when he made 10 dance films, Atlas was an assistant stage manager for the company, and was already filming Cunningham in little experimental movement studies during breaks from rehearsal. Following his work with Cunningham, he worked independently in film while collaborating with other professionals in the field.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T10:34:38.949730+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6268, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Atlas_(artist)"}], "uuid": "d4ff9440-4e43-4160-9d77-db592dc0c3b0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2476", "external_references": [{"id": 32593, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5075231"}, {"id": 56128, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "272303319"}, {"id": 56129, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no92030324"}, {"id": 56130, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no92030324"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T10:34:38.969859+10:00"}

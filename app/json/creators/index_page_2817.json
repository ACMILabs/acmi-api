He is a two-time Academy Award nominee who is best known for the animated films It's Such a Beautiful Day, the World of Tomorrow series, and Rejected. In 2014, his work appeared on The Simpsons. Eight of his short films have competed at the Sundance Film Festival, a festival record. He is also the only filmmaker to have won the Sundance Film Festival's Grand Jury Prize for Short Film twice.\nHertzfeldt's work has been described as \"some of the most influential animation ever created\", \"some of the most vital and expressive animation of the millennium\", and \"some of the most essential short films of the last 20 years\". In 2020, GQ described his work as \"simultaneously tragic and hilarious and philosophical and crude and deeply sad and fatalist and yet stubbornly, resolutely hopeful.\"In his book The World History of Animation, author Stephen Cavalier writes \"Hertzfeldt is either a unique phenomenon or perhaps an example of a new way forward for individual animators surviving independently on their own terms... he attracts the kind of fanatical support from the student and alternative crowds usually associated with indie rock bands\".Hertzfeldt's feature film It's Such a Beautiful Day was listed by many film critics as one of the best films of 2012 and the L.A. Film Critics Association named it runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year. After a limited UK release in 2013, the film was ranked #3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013 and #4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, Time Out New York ranked It's Such a Beautiful Day #16 on its list of the \"100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made,\" and in 2016, The Film Stage critics ranked the film #1 on their list of \"The 50 Best Animated Films of the 21st Century Thus Far.\" In 2019, The Wrap named It's Such a Beautiful Day the #1 \"Best Animated Film of the 2010s.\" The same year, the Vulture film critics ranked it #12 on their overall list of the \"Best Movies of the Decade.\"In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked World of Tomorrow #10 on its list of the \"40 Greatest Animated Movies Ever\". Despite its short running time, The A.V. Club called it \"possibly the best film of 2015.\" In 2019, Indiewire ranked World of Tomorrow #17 in its overall list of the \"100 Best Movies of the Decade\". In 2020, Indiewire called it \"one of the greatest short films in the history of movies.\"World of Tomorrow Episode Two: The Burden of Other People's Thoughts premiered in 2017 and received rare \"A+\" reviews from Indiewire and Collider, where it was described as \"another soulful sci-fi masterpiece.\" The Daily Beast called it \"a must-see animated masterpiece\" and \"one of the best films of the year.\"Hertzfeldt's latest animated short film, World of Tomorrow Episode Three: The Absent Destinations of David Prime was released in 2020 to more positive reviews, including another \"A+\" from Indiewire. Of the \"dreamy, beloved\" ongoing series, The Film Stage noted, \"Hertzfeldt has crafted what might be the crowning achievement of modern science fiction.\"Hertzfeldt primarily supports his work through self-distribution such as ticket sales from theatrical tours, DVDs, VOD, and television broadcasts. He has refused all advertising work.Hertzfeldt lives in Austin, Texas. He spent many years in Santa Barbara, California after attending college there.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:40:16.423284+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3892, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hertzfeldt"}], "uuid": "2f3830e1-c422-4f8b-984a-8ce96d8ca345", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111317", "external_references": [{"id": 26383, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q594400"}, {"id": 28200, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "78917594"}, {"id": 28201, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2009016266"}, {"id": 28202, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2009016266"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T23:05:01.443325+11:00"}, {"id": 8055, "name": "Nag Vladermersky", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 911283, "title": "Ashputtle or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 92033, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2635888, "title": "Ashputtle: or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 108441, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2635889, "title": "Ashputtle: or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 108441, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-11T13:15:25.563552+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "d8b3726c-0fa0-4173-ad40-f4cac8aec73d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111122", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T10:30:17.443749+11:00"}, {"id": 8054, "name": "Susi Allender", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 911282, "title": "Ashputtle or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 92033, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2635884, "title": "Ashputtle: or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 108441, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2635887, "title": "Ashputtle: or the mother's ghost", "work_id": 108441, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-11T13:15:24.254024+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "27c9fa7d-4593-42c1-93da-38550bc23867", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111121", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T10:30:16.202262+11:00"}, {"id": 8048, "name": "Loic Bail", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2619242, "title": "AP 2000", "work_id": 108440, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-11T14:09:16.343559+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "31254abf-fe18-480d-a958-b773596d6501", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111301", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T23:02:20.925272+11:00"}, {"id": 8047, "name": "Keith Salvat", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2374115, "title": "Robert Klippel", "work_id": 92014, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1804809, "title": "The Dreaming.

He came to the attention of Columbia Pictures for his talent for promotion and was hired. He learned the trade of filmmaking and became a director, acquiring a reputation for the ability to churn out competent B-movies quickly and on budget. He eventually struck out on his own, producing and directing thrillers, which, despite their low budgets, he effectively promoted using gimmicks, a trademark for which he is best known. He was also the producer for Rosemary's Baby.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:26:40.193874+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5346, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Castle"}], "uuid": "4acf4962-75f1-49ac-bbbb-11e528b63902", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30391", "external_references": [{"id": 26826, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q934087"}, {"id": 31994, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "49484255"}, {"id": 31995, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91110479"}, {"id": 31996, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91110479"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T17:26:51.848760+10:00"}

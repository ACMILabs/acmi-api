In 1959 he joined Richard Leacock, the Mayles Brother and others at Drew Associates, who, in association with Time Inc aimed to further the use of film in journalism. Drew Associates developed the first fully portable 16mm film system, allowing the development of the 'cinema verite' documentary style, whereby the filmmakers adopted an observational, fly-on-the-wall approach to their subject matter, in opposition to the use of planned interviews and 'voice of God' narration.\n\nPennebaker's extensive and influential body of work has focused largely on political and musical subjects, including the landmark 'Primary' (1960), which followed Kennedy in the Winsconsin Presidential Primary and 'Don't Look Back' (1965), a behind the scenes portrait of Bob Dylan on tour in England.

The change led to a divorce from his first wife, the Hungarian film actress María Corda, who was unable to make the transition from silent films to \"talkies\" because of her strong Hungarian accent.\r\nFrom 1930, Korda was active in the British film industry, and soon became one of its leading figures. He was the founder of London Films and, post-war, the owner of British Lion Films, a film distribution company. Korda produced many outstanding classics of the British film industry, including The Private Life of Henry VIII, Rembrandt, Things To Come, The Thief of Baghdad and The Third Man. In 1942, Korda became the first filmmaker to receive a knighthood.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:44:38+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1596, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Korda"}], "uuid": "bc8fc7f3-27a9-47c9-9524-4fd042bfbe6e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14923", "external_references": [{"id": 6984, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55221"}, {"id": 6985, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "102339929"}, {"id": 6986, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81142348"}, {"id": 6987, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81142348"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T00:30:47.808274+11:00"}

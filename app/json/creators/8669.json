She has shot over 25 short films, including the AFC funded \"Green Eyes\" (ACS Gold); \"Lamb\" (Tropfest winner 2002);\n\"Blood and Ash\" (Cinematography prize St Kilda Festival 2001); and \"Restoration\" (ACS Silver). Over the last year she has been DoP on three short features produced for the AFC & SBSi:\n\n\"Martha's New Coat\", directed by Rachel Ward, produced by Liz Watts and starring Matilda Brown, Dan Wylie and Lisa Hensley.

This film recently won the Golden Gate Award for Best TV Narrative (long form) at the San Francisco International Film Festival, as well as an ACS Silver.\n\nBased in the UK since high school, she gained a BA Hons from Cambridge University in Philosophy and History of Art. While studying she extensively researched the renowned Swedish cinematographer Sven Nykvist and wrote her thesis about the relationship between his work and Scandanavian painting. She then gained experience in the TV industry on visual arts documentaries, working as a researcher and producer/director at both the South Bank Show and BBC 2. One of these was a highly popular documentary on Herge's artwork for his Tintin comic books; and another was a portrait of a woman artist with Down's Syndrome.\n\nHaving become increasingly interested in cinematography, she assisted on projects before returning to Australia and gaining an MA Hons in Cinematography at the AFTRS film school, graduating with 4 awards including the overall cinematography prize. For her Honours project she conceived and directed an experimental dance film, \"Restoration\", which won numerous awards both in Australia and overseas, including: Best Work on Film or Video at the National Dance Awards; a Dendy Award in 2000; and Best Short Film at Long Beach Festival, USA. Following AFTRS she directed a ten minute thriller, \"Look\", for Film Four in the UK, which screened at numerous festivals internationally, including being a finalist at the Manhattan International Short Film Competition.\n\nIn addition to drama, Cordelia continues to photograph music videos, commercials & observational documentaries and was also director of an SBS documentary on choreographer Gideon Obarazanek of Chunky Move. Collaborations with artists have included filming pieces for Susan Norrie, John Conomos, Chris Caines and photographing the interactive dance installation \"Closer\" by Gideon Obarzanek for ACMI. In additional to her camerawork she has also exhibited 'narrative' still photographs and is developing her work further in both this area and experimental filmmaking.\n(Provided by Cordelia Beresford)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:56:09.908180+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9d0b6178-c26f-486b-b0d1-e1c7e66db337", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "111516", "external_references": [{"id": 41343, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121298776"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:56:09.908515+11:00"}

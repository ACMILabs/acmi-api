He is commonly grouped under the loose association of filmmakers known as the \"Sixth Generation\" of the Cinema of China. Like others in this generation, and in contrast with earlier Chinese filmmakers who produced mostly historical drama, Wang proposed a “new urban Chinese cinema [that] has been mainly concerned with bearing witness of a fast- paced transforming China and producing a localized critique of globalization.”Many of Wang's works are known for their sensitive portrayal of teens and youths, most notable in films such as Beijing Bicycle,  So Close to Paradise, Drifters, and Shanghai Dreams.  His 2008 film In Love We Trust was an exception as it portrays marital strains.\nIn 2010 Wang was appointed a chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He also served as a member of the jury of the BigScreen Italia Film Festival 2006, held in Kunming, Yunnan, China.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:21:18.116006+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3278, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xiaoshuai"}], "uuid": "36f901ed-c62f-48e7-9776-7ae60e4fc08a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30275", "external_references": [{"id": 13868, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q710763"}, {"id": 13869, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "62701405"}, {"id": 13870, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2003045446"}, {"id": 13871, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2003045446"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:33:14.622336+10:00"}

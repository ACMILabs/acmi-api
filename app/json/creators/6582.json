In 1993 she began working with David Chesworth on sound installations for many arts and cultural contexts including museums, art spaces, public sites and public events. Together they formed a partnership which led to the establishment of Wax Sound Media.\n\nRecent projects include interpretive sound installations for the Museum of Victoria, Melbourne's Immigration Museum and the Museum of Sydney, reflecting Leber's ongoing interest in cultural history and the use of sound to multiply meanings and contexts.\n\nIn 1994, Leber was invited to curate a major 'sound art' event for the Melbourne-based Contemporary Music Events. Earwitness: Excursions in Sound presented a unique showcase for the work of over 25 major Australian and international artists working with sound. It featured installations and performance work at a wide variety of galleries and urban sites including Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Royal Botanic Gardens, Old Melbourne Observatory and Old Melbourne Gaol.\n\nLeber originally studied Media Arts, which led to eight years' employment in the film industry as a film camera-person and focus-puller on numerous films and documentaries. During this time she made four short films including Doubtful Invitation and History Takes Place. Her films have been exhibited widely at film festivals and contemporary art spaces including Germany's Oberhausen International Film Festival (in competition); Madrid Week of Experimental Cinema; the Aurora Australis tour of galleries in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Calgary, and Ontario; Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; ATOM Awards (finalist); Experimenta, Melbourne; Perth Institute of Contemporary Art; Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane; and Australian Perspecta.\n\nLeber began her association with RMIT's Faculty of the Constructed Environment in 1994. She established a subject in which students investigate the concerns of architecture and contemporary urban design through the medium of video. She continues to lecture at RMIT within the architecture/urban design context\n\nBiography taken from WAX SOUND MEDIA website.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T22:45:25.875364+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "205c249b-2bf9-43c3-85d7-6f9c191439c5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110108", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T22:45:25.875627+11:00"}

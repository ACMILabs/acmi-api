She was perhaps best-known for her role in Kazan's film, Splendor in the Grass (1961), in which she played Warren Beatty's sister, as well as for portraying a fictionalized version of Marilyn Monroe in Kazan's stage production of After the Fall, written by Monroe's former husband, playwright Arthur Miller.\n\nIn 1970, Loden wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the independent film, Wanda. Innovative in its cinéma vérité style, it was one of the very few American films directed by a woman to be theatrically released at that time. Film critic David Thomson has written: \"Wanda is full of unexpected moments and raw atmosphere, never settling for cliché in situation or character.\" The film won the International Critics' Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1970 and was presented at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-13T01:03:09.155956+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3606, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Loden"}], "uuid": "8095639f-1544-42e3-b1a1-0fc4ca96e45c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "15654", "external_references": [{"id": 26558, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q442111"}, {"id": 27402, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "37127072"}, {"id": 27403, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2004029167"}, {"id": 27404, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2004029167"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T01:03:09.156222+11:00"}

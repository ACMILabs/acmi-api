He was one of the foremost creatives of the surrealist, avant-garde, and Dadaist movements; and one of the most influential figures in early 20th-century art as a whole. The National Observer suggested that, “of the artistic generation whose daring gave birth to Twentieth Century Art, Cocteau came closest to being a Renaissance man.”He is best known for his novels Le Grand Écart (1923), Le Livre Blanc (1928), and Les Enfants Terribles (1929); the stage plays La Voix Humaine (1930), La Machine Infernale (1934), Les Parents terribles (1938), La Machine à écrire (1941), and L'Aigle à deux têtes (1946); and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946), Orpheus (1950), and Testament of Orpheus (1960), which alongside Blood of a Poet and Orpheus constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as \"one of [the] avant-garde's most successful and influential filmmakers\" by AllMovie. Cocteau, according to Annette Insdorf, “left behind a body of work unequalled for its variety of artistic expression.”Though his body of work encompassed many different mediums, Cocteau insisted on calling himself a poet, classifying the great variety of his works – poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films – as \"poésie\", \"poésie de roman\", \"poésie de thêatre\", \"poésie critique\", \"poésie graphique\" and \"poésie cinématographique\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:55:35.927422+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2349, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau"}], "uuid": "7dcfe490-10db-43dc-a5aa-98ddcf397711", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1371", "external_references": [{"id": 10074, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q83158"}, {"id": 10075, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "12306661"}, {"id": 10076, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79007043"}, {"id": 10077, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79007043"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:34:43.953446+11:00"}, {"id": 7139, "name": "Georges Franju", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2560946, "title": "Therese Desqueyroux", "work_id": 116186, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 858022, "title": "The Blood of the beast = Le sang des betes", "work_id": 72474, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2224202, "title": "Eyes without a face", "work_id": 86486, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560482, "title": "Judex (English Version)", "work_id": 115951, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560789, "title": "Thomas L'imposteur = Thomas the Imposter", "work_id": 116100, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560939, "title": "La Tete Contre les Murs = the Keepers", "work_id": 116180, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Georges Auguste René Franju", "date_of_birth": "1912-04-12", "date_of_death": "1987-11-05", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 4, "name": "French", "slug": "french"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "biography": "Georges Franju (French: [fʁɑ̃ʒy]; 12 April 1912 – 5 November 1987) was a French filmmaker.

His images usually contain people or spoken and written words (such as the text from Maurice Blanchot's The Gaze of Orpheus or Wittgenstein's Remarks on Colour). He investigates the conditions of perception with interactive installations. What interests him are the gaps between meaning and reference and where image ends and reality begins. Hill has staged shows in major museums and galleries all over the world. One-person shows have been organised in museums such as Centre Pompidou (1992), I.V.A.M. in Valencia (1993), Stedelijk Van Abbe Museum in Amsterdam (1993) and in many American institutions. At the Venice Biennale (1995), Hill presented a labyrinth of 'words' which were activated by the presence of the viewer and which created different discourses according to the paths taken. In Australia he is exhibiting his Tall Ships, ('the one undisputed hit of Documenta IX and the 1993 Whitney Biennial, and remains one of the most compelling works of the last decade'), a long and dark corridor that the viewer can walk through, while activating moving images of human figures on the walls as they are approached.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T23:01:07.615917+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4015, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hill"}], "uuid": "b67a3ba2-975d-4e22-80b8-10c36ea9c932", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110737", "external_references": [{"id": 26210, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2545780"}, {"id": 28524, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "96095476"}, {"id": 28525, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n93075444"}, {"id": 28526, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n93075444"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T23:01:07.616129+11:00"}, {"id": 7132, "name": "Luc Courchesne", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2710218, "title": "The Visitor: living by number [documentation]", "work_id": 108253, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Luc Courchesne (Canada b.1952)\n\nLuc Courchesne began his explorations in interactive visitor-triggered video in 1984 when he co-authored Elastic Movies with Bill Seamen among others at MIT.

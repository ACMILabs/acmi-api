He is best known for his influential work as a director of TV comedy programs for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation – most notably The Aunty Jack Show – and for his 1980 feature film adaptation of the Australian comic strip Fatty Finn.\nAfter a month as a Melbourne University student, Murphy realised that his true calling was in the entertainment world. For the next three years, he financed his theatrical pursuits at The Little Theatre in South Yarra, by working at the Victorian Railways. In 1960, Murphy joined the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) where he worked his way up to being a director: 'The ABC was a great training institute at that time, and a place which allowed me much creative freedom. I learned a great deal there'. His first big break was in 1967 with the big budget 20-episode variety series, I'm Alright Now, with Reg Livermore. In 1973, Murphy became Head of Entertainment at the ABC.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:10:18.284336+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2676, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Murphy_(director)"}], "uuid": "20df535d-fbd1-4ebf-a702-14a144879b2b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24840", "external_references": [{"id": 11427, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6793366"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T11:50:09.329851+10:00"}

He is best known for his Shakespearean roles, especially King Lear. He often appeared in film, rising from a bit part actor to leading roles; by the time of his death he had appeared in nearly 140 films. His later work was predominantly in television and radio.\nBorn in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, into a family with no theatrical connections, Hordern was educated at Windlesham House School in Pulborough, West Sussex. He went on to Brighton College, where his interest in the theatre developed. After leaving the college he joined an amateur dramatics company, and came to the notice of several influential Shakespearean directors who cast him in minor roles in Othello and Macbeth. During the Second World War he served on HMS Illustrious, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. Upon demobilisation he resumed his acting career and made his television debut, becoming a bit-part actor in many films, particularly in the war film genre.\nHordern came to prominence in the early 1950s when he took part in a theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. This led to a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, where he played major parts including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1957 he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular supporting roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).\nIn the late 1960s Hordern met the British theatre director Jonathan Miller, who cast him in \"Whistle and I'll Come to You\", which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern's next major play was Jumpers at the Royal National Theatre in 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. Hordern's television credits towards the end of his life included Paradise Postponed, the BAFTA award-winning Memento Mori, and the BBC adaptation of Middlemarch. He was appointed a CBE in 1972 and was knighted eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995 aged 83.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:14:24.029707+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4694, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hordern"}], "uuid": "467fa3ed-b065-4dc3-b718-55da8535f1ae", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34144", "external_references": [{"id": 25482, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q956867"}, {"id": 30319, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "59274057"}, {"id": 30320, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91003094"}, {"id": 30321, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91003094"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:06:06.132459+10:00"}, {"id": 80149, "name": "Sophia Loren", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2215602, "title": "El Cid", "work_id": 93136, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone", "date_of_birth": "1934-09-20", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 6, "name": "Italian", "slug": "italian"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "biography": "Sofia Costanza Brigida Villani Scicolone  (Italian: [soˈfiːa vilˈlaːni ʃʃikoˈloːne]; born 20 September 1934), known professionally as Sophia Loren ( lə-REN, Italian: [ˈlɔːren]), is an Italian actress. She was named by the American Film Institute as one of the greatest stars of classical Hollywood cinema and as of 2023, is one of the last surviving major stars from the era. Loren is also the only remaining living person to appear on AFI's list of the 50 greatest  stars of American film history, positioned 21st. \nEncouraged to enroll in acting lessons after entering a beauty pageant, Loren began her film career at age sixteen in 1950. She appeared in several bit parts and minor roles in the early part of the decade, until her five-picture contract with Paramount in 1956 launched her international career. Her film appearances around this time include The Pride and the Passion, Houseboat, and It Started in Naples. During the 1950s, she starred in films as a sexually emancipated persona and was one of the best known sex symbols of the time.\nLoren's performance as Cesira in the film Two Women (1961) directed by Vittorio De Sica won her the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first actor to win an Oscar for a non-English-language performance. She holds the record for having earned seven David di Donatello Awards for Best Actress: Two Women; Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963); Marriage Italian Style (1964, for which she was nominated for a second Oscar); Sunflower (1970); The Voyage (1974); A Special Day (1977) and The Life Ahead (2020). She has won five special Golden Globes (including the Cecil B. DeMille Award), a BAFTA Award, a Laurel Award, a Grammy Award, the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1991, she received the Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievements.\nAt the start of the 1980s, Loren chose to make rarer film appearances. Since then, she has appeared in films such as Prêt-à-porter (1994), Grumpier Old Men (1995), Nine (2009), and The Life Ahead (2020).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:07:36.222136+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5178, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren"}], "uuid": "248efc13-afb5-4070-8214-a1a713378c1e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38152", "external_references": [{"id": 25147, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q43252"}, {"id": 31571, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "115103987"}, {"id": 31572, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50042300"}, {"id": 31573, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50042300"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:23:38.404170+10:00"}, {"id": 80148, "name": "Charlton Heston", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2215599, "title": "El Cid", "work_id": 93136, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1923-10-04", "date_of_death": "2008-04-05", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Charlton Heston (born John Charles Carter; October 4, 1923 – April 5, 2008) was an American actor and political activist.\nAs a Hollywood star, he appeared in almost 100 films over the course of 60 years.

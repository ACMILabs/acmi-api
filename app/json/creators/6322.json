Resonating with a highly metaphorical sensibility, Cho's single-channel tapes and installations are formalist, almost painterly explorations of subjectivity and the subconscious. The urban landscapes that Cho often depicts move with a continuous fluidity, shifting from dreamlike abstractions of light to fleeting reflections of the city. Figures, cars, and trains are mirrored and diffused through one another, silhouetted with a haunting anonymity that is echoed in the poetic texts and soundscapes that accompany each piece. These often tense meditations focus on the nature and cost of isolation and loneliness while integrating into a culture, landscape and language other than one's own.\n\nSeoungho Cho was born in 1959 in Seoul, South Korea. He received his B.A. and M.A. in Graphic Arts from Hong-Ik University, Korea, and an M.A. in video art from New York University. In 1998 he received a Rockefeller Foundation Media Arts Fellowship. He has received the \"Juror?s Citation\" at the 18th Annual Black Maria Film and Video Festival, the Jack Goodman Fellowship in New York, and was specially selected in the Korean Art Competition five years in a row. Cho received a residency at Banff Centre for the Arts, Alberta, Canada.\n\nCho's one-person exhibitions have included The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Philip Feldman Gallery, Oregon; Contemporary Art Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii; and The Knitting Factory, New York. His work has been shown in numerous international festivals and exhibitions, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; New York Video Festival; Pandaemonium '98, Lux Centre, London; Centro d'Art Santa Monica, Barcelona, Spain; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Kwangju Biennial, Korea; the Robert Flaherty Film Seminars; and Artists Space, New York. Cho's tapes have been broadcast nationally and internationally. He lives in New York.\n\n(FT 30.03.05)", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:44:29.512699+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "6c14b159-4563-4523-aaac-c0439a7a599e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110029", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:44:29.512942+11:00"}

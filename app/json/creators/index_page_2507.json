Pulsating with vibrant color and kinetic motion, his richly textured, densely layered collages evoke both \"apocalypse and rapture,\" as he confronts the political conflicts, personal losses, and spiritual rituals of contemporary life.\n\nNaturalistic images recorded with a consumer quality camcorder are transformed by Gorewitz into evocative dreams or nightmares, as he explores the expressive potential of low-end imaging devices such as the Fairlight CVI, Amiga, and Macintosh computers in an \"active, physical experience.\" Gorewitz's canvas is broad; he records a multi-cultural mosaic of urban and pastoral landscapes, from New York City's South Bronx and the American South to Jamaica, Morocco, and Israel. He filters his themes through a subjective analysis, creating moments of haunting beauty or menace as metaphorical visual expressions. Personal symbolism and social consciousness are inextricably intertwined in Gorewitz's unique visions, which resonate with an underlying spiritual, almost mystical power.\n\nIn addition to ongoing work with video, he is producing digital prints and work created specifically for the World Wide Web.\n\nGorewitz was born in 1949. He received a B.F.A. from the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied with Nam June Paik, Dick Higgins and Allan Kaprow; and an M.F.A. from Antioch International University. The 1989 recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Gorewitz has also received awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. He was an artist in residence at the Experimental Television Center, Owego, New York, from 1978-93, and was artist-in-residence at the Beersheva Institute of Art in Jerusalem. Currently a professor of Multimedia Arts at Ramapo College, New Jersey, he has also taught at the University of Bridgeport and Hofstra University. Gorewitz's work has been exhibited internationally, at festivals and institutions including the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh; Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition, New York; Jewish Museum, New York; Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Kowasaki Museum, Tokyo. His work has been featured on National Public Television, the Learning Channel, the USA Cable Network, and many regional PBS stations.

Working in the San Francisco Bay Area, his political, site-specific performance actions explored ritual and symbolic content in the objects, places, and natural phenomena of everyday life.\n\nFox's work in video is an extension of these concerns. His 1974 Children's Tapes is a classic early investigation of the medium. With wit and ingenuity, Fox used the intimate scale and time-based properties of video to translate the aesthetic and formal tenets of minimalism, real time, perception and performance into the realm of the everyday. These engaging phenomenological dramas, which illustrate basic principles of physical science with household objects, unfold as anecdotal narratives of the quotidian.\n\nLiving and working in Europe for the past several years, Fox has continued to produce multi-media installations, performances and sculptures.\n\nTerry Fox was born in 1943. He studied at the Cornish School of Allied Arts in Seattle and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Rome.

In a series of works entitled 'Private Hungary', Forgacs recontextualizes archival home movies and film journals from the past, transforming private documents of everyday lives into haunting narratives of twentieth-century Hungary.\nForgacs' works merge drama and anthropology, documentary and diary. His reclamation of amateur home movies and personal film journals from the 1920s to the 1960s results in subjective histories of Hungary during war and Communism, outside of 'official' history.\nInevitably infused with a poignant, often elegiac aura, these works also set in motion questions of the relation of the home movie to narrative cinema and documentary film. As these once highly specific documents of everyday life move from the private into the public sphere, their subjects become ghosts of the past.\nForgacs has long been engaged in investigating alternative historical and cultural narratives through the private documentation of the everyday. In 1983 he established the Private Film & Photo Archives, a unique collection of amateur films and snapshots of twentieth-century Hungary, for use in cultural and anthropological research.\nForgacs has since 1978 worked at the Bela Balazs Film Studio in Budapest. In the same year he began collaborating with composer/musician Tibor Szemzo. Forgacs, who also works in video installation and performance, has more recently produced a series of works that he terms 'video operas.'Peter Forgacs was born in 1950. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest, and was a researcher at the Hungarian Sociological Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His works have been exhibited internationally,including the Sao Paolo Biennial, the Flaherty Film Seminar, and the Centre d'Art Contemporaine, Geneva. His video works are in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Pacific Film Archives, Berkeley; Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest, among others.

Energetic and kinetic, his music videos, dance pieces and experimental narratives are characterized by high-tech computer editing and post-production.\n\nIn 1983 Sanborn began collaborating with Mary Perillo on a series of innovative public television productions, for which she has served as co-director, producer and editor. Collaborating with musicians and performers, including dancer Twyla Tharp, playwright Lee Breuer and avant-garde percussionist David Van Tieghem, Sanborn and Perillo used electronic imaging devices, formats and techniques, including paintbox animation and high-definition television, to create startling visual effects.\n\nSanborn has also worked with Dean Winkler, a design engineer/specialist in computer graphics and optical services (now Creative Director of Post Perfect in New York), on a series of tapes that fuse computer graphics and live action, combining state-of-the-art technology with arresting visual and aural motifs. From 1976 to 1982, Sanborn collaborated with Kit Fitzgerald on a widely acclaimed body of experimental video works.\n\nSanborn was born in 1954. He attended Fordham University and New York University. The recipient of grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New York State Council on the Arts, he was an artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen from 1977 to 1983, and at WXXI-TV, Rochester and Synapse Video Center, Syracuse University. He has taught at numerous universities. Sanborn's collaborative work has been exhibited throughout the world, at festivals and institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; American Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles; Berlin Film Festival; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Institute of Contemporary Art, London; and the San Sebastian Film Festival, Spain. Sanborn lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nThe Last Videotapes of Marcel Duchamp, 1976, 32:03 min, b&w and color, sound\nJohn Sanborn and Dean Winkler: Selected Works, 1983-85, 18:59 min, color, sound\nAct III, 1983, 6:30 min, color.\nRenaissance, 1984, 5:38 min, color.\nLuminare, 1985, 6:51 min, color.\nComplication Shakedown, 1984, 4:57 min, color, sound\nEar-Responsiblity, 1985, 7:33 min, color, sound\nSister Suzie Cinema, 1985, 22:33 min, color, sound\nDance ex Machina, 1986, 2:20 min, color, sound\nJohn Sanborn and Mary Perillo: Dance Works, 1986-88, 48:40 min, color, sound\nFractured Variations/Visual Shuffle, 1986, 15:15 min, color.

Following early success in his home country with drama films such as Massacre in Rome with Richard Burton (based on the real-life Ardeatine massacre), Cosmatos retooled his career towards mainstream \"blockbuster\" action and adventure films, including The Cassandra Crossing and Escape to Athena, both of which were British-Italian co-productions. After relocating to North America, he directed the horror film Of Unknown Origin. This was followed by some of his best-known work, including the action films Rambo: First Blood Part II and Cobra (both of which star Sylvester Stallone), the science-fiction horror film Leviathan, and the critically acclaimed Western Tombstone.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:35:56.746512+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2122, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_P._Cosmatos"}], "uuid": "89ae22fc-aa98-4e2a-8cb3-59aec02c2cfe", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "19654", "external_references": [{"id": 9139, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q504722"}, {"id": 9140, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "74045912"}, {"id": 9141, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr97024622"}, {"id": 9142, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr97024622"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:29:37.224358+10:00"}

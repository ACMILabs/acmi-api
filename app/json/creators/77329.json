In 2002, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:46:15.682433+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2948, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Widmark"}], "uuid": "048e570b-e691-49a5-a73f-7ba004398865", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27534", "external_references": [{"id": 12526, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q320036"}, {"id": 12527, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "49280025"}, {"id": 12528, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85040587"}, {"id": 12529, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85040587"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T16:46:15.693701+10:00"}

Considered one of the great filmmakers of the Italian cinema, Bertolucci's work achieved international acclaim. He was the first Italian filmmaker to win the Academy Award for Best Director for The Last Emperor (1987), one of many accolades including two Golden Globes, two David di Donatellos, a British Academy Award, and a César Award. In recognition of his work, he was presented with the inaugural Honorary Palme d'Or Award at the opening ceremony of the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. He had previously received a Lifetime Achievement Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival.\nA protégé of Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bertolucci made his directorial debut at 22. His second film, Before the Revolution (1964), earned strong international reviews and has since gained classic status, being called a \"masterpiece of Italian cinema\" by Film4. His 1970 film The Conformist, an adaptation of the Alberto Moravia novel, is considered a classic of international cinema, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the prestigious Berlin Golden Bear. In 1972, his erotic drama Last Tango in Paris erupted a firestorm of controversy over its graphic sexuality,  Bertolucci's and star Marlon Brando's working relationship with actress Maria Schneider, and continues to spark debate. Bertolucci's films such as the historical epic 1900 (1976), the family drama La Luna (1979), and the darkly comedic Tragedy of a Ridiculous Man (1981), were likewise controversial but acclaimed.\nHis 1987 film The Last Emperor, a biopic of Chinese monarch Puyi, was a critical and commercial success, earning rave reviews and sweeping the 60th Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director). He followed its success with two more films in his \"Oriental Trilogy\" – The Sheltering Sky, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, and Little Buddha, a Buddhist religious epic. His 1996 film, Stealing Beauty, brought him his second of two Palme d'Or nominations. He continued directing well into the 21st century, releasing his final film, Me and You, in 2012.\nBertolucci's films often deal with themes of politics, sexuality, history, class conflict, and social taboos; marked by a sensual, colorful visual style that's proved influential to filmmakers around the world. Several of his films have appeared on lists of the greatest film of all time.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:55:35.520321+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1712, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci"}], "uuid": "554d42c5-e802-4b6d-9a79-b3114dd2fe97", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "15853", "external_references": [{"id": 7471, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q53009"}, {"id": 7472, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "109921450"}, {"id": 7473, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50009086"}, {"id": 7474, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50009086"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:28:26.276702+10:00"}, {"id": 23663, "name": "Arthur Penn", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2650055, "title": "Bonnie and Clyde (Captioned)", "work_id": 82659, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994776, "title": "Little Big Man", "work_id": 90541, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2122415, "title": "Bonnie and clyde [DVD]", "work_id": 92758, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988876, "title": "The Miracle worker", "work_id": 84944, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993822, "title": "The Left handed gun", "work_id": 89558, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2649372, "title": "Night Moves", "work_id": 81414, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1922-09-27", "date_of_death": "2010-09-28", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Arthur Hiller Penn  (September 27, 1922 – September 28, 2010) was an American director and producer of film, television and theater.

He was the son of a leading French actor, Lucien Guitry, and followed his father into the theatrical profession. He became known for his stage performances, particularly in boulevardier roles. He was also a prolific playwright, writing 115 plays throughout his career. He was married five times, always to rising actresses whose careers he furthered. Probably his best-known wife was Yvonne Printemps to whom he was married between 1919 and 1932.\nGuitry's plays range from historical dramas to contemporary light comedies. Some have musical scores, by composers including André Messager and Reynaldo Hahn. When silent films became popular Guitry avoided them, finding the lack of spoken dialogue fatal to dramatic impact. From the 1930s to the end of his life he enthusiastically embraced the cinema, making as many as five films in a single year.\nThe later years of Guitry's career were overshadowed by accusations of collaborating with the occupying Germans after the capitulation of France in the Second World War. The charges were dismissed, but Guitry, a strongly patriotic man, was disillusioned by the vilification he received from some of his compatriots. By the time of his death, his popular esteem had been restored to the extent that 12,000 people filed past his coffin before his burial in Paris.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:59:54.060993+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3047, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacha_Guitry"}], "uuid": "0e0670ae-f5f5-473f-ab89-95a83941d8b2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28426", "external_references": [{"id": 12930, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q337276"}, {"id": 12931, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "14770929"}, {"id": 12932, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50018815"}, {"id": 12933, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50018815"}], "date_modified": "2025-05-22T22:51:54.781669+10:00"}, {"id": 23660, "name": "Clement Duhour", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1985711, "title": "Napoleon", "work_id": 81413, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3104463, "title": "Si Versailles M'etait Conte = Affairs in Versailles", "work_id": 115925, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Denis Clément Duhour", "date_of_birth": "1911-12-11", "date_of_death": "1983-01-03", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 4, "name": "French", "slug": "french"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "biography": "Clément Duhour was born in Saint-Jean d’Anglet, in the Aquitaine region of south-western France on 11 December 1912.

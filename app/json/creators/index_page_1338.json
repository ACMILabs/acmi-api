Natural Nylon was formed with the aim of giving those involved more control over their careers, 'supporting British acting talent, and keeping it in the UK'.Bryant had quit his job as cameraman in 1991 and, together with his wife, opened a club on Beak Street in London's Soho. He struck up a friendship with TV producer Bradley Adams, whose wife introduced them to Frost, who was going out with Law after meeting him on the set of Shopping. McGregor and Pertwee had also met Law through this film - Pertwee also appeared in it and McGregor read for the part that went to Law. Completing the line-up was Miller, a friend of Law since they met at the National Youth Music Theatre in their late teens. The majority of the group lived in the Primrose Hill area, and were part of the Primrose Hill set.\nNatural Nylon was formed in the late 90s, and the first film to be produced by Natural Nylon was David Cronenberg's eXistenZ (1999) which  was followed by Nora (2000), XX/XY (2002), Owning Mahowny (2003), To Kill a King (2003), and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004).  They co-produced an acclaimed adaptation of Dr Faustus at the Young Vic in 2002.Bryant and McGregor left the company in 2002, and Law resigned as director in January 2003, with the reason given as the taking off of the Hollywood careers of McGregor and Law. As the company was effectively wound down in early 2003, Variety wrote Natural Nylon never lived up to its Britpack hype. Founded seven years ago amid claims by the actor partners that it would enable them to take greater control over their careers, it only managed to get its name on four films — “eXistenZ,” “Nora” and the upcoming “To Kill a King” and “Owning Mahowny.” \n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:21:56.150757+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4764, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Nylon"}], "uuid": "3e94975c-dbb4-462e-9ba9-a5c97d4872fc", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10847", "external_references": [{"id": 25232, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q16955312"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:26:16.686119+10:00"}, {"id": 37314, "name": "H2O Motion Pictures", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2183156, "title": "Owning Mahowny", "work_id": 95138, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:56:15.547788+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3462aceb-153d-46dc-ba8e-36020024821d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8952", "external_references": [{"id": 34501, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121091287"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:26:40.615015+10:00"}, {"id": 37307, "name": "Dr TV", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2355739, "title": "The Idiots = Idioterne", "work_id": 95132, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:03:38.859975+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c65473af-83e1-4f0d-a78d-21083e29e82d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18445", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 37306, "name": "Zentropa Entertainments2 ApS", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2355736, "title": "The Idiots = Idioterne", "work_id": 95132, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:03:38.620384+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "03a1bfca-f33c-4ba9-93b6-8011be3c6fe8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14541", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 37305, "name": "The Ely Landau Organization", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2354960, "title": "Bertolt Brecht's Galileo = Galileo", "work_id": 95131, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T20:02:28.344051+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "d7ac79d1-6de4-4504-a569-1b8a7a4c65e0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4847", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 37303, "name": "Frank Henenlotter", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2108629, "title": "Basket case", "work_id": 95128, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1950-08-29", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Frank Henenlotter (born August 29, 1950 in New York City) is an American screenwriter, film director and film historian.

His installations and videotapes, which have received international recognition, are distinguished by a confluence of allegorical resonance and virtuosic control of technology. Viola explores video's temporal and optical systems to metaphorically examine modes of perception and cognition, and ultimately chart a symbolic quest for self. Employing a rigorous structuralism, a ritualized investigation of visual and acoustic phenomena, illusion and reality, he achieves a poetic articulation of visionary transcendence. \"Visual poems, allegories in the language of subjective perception,\" is how Viola terms his videotapes, which include such major works as Chott el-Djerid (1979); Hatsu Yume (First Dream) (1981); and I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like (1986).\n\nLight and time are the essential materials with which Viola conducts his metaphysical, at times spiritual search to know and define the self. Rendered plastic, they are used to define a symbolic language of the unconscious and consciousness, microcosm and macrocosm, inner and outer landscapes. Unfolding without spoken language, infused with emblematic transformations and archetypal images, his works suggest subconscious dreams or pre-lingual memories. Viola's extraordinary use of video technology to \"sculpt\" with time is one of his few \"special effects.\" Time-lapse, slow motion, reversals, duration and other temporal interventions acquire metaphorical significance, evoking cycles of day and night, birth, life, death and renewal.\n\nThis unique exploration of technological systems to articulate transcendent perceptions reflects a convergence of eclectic influences: musical principles; the philosophies and rituals of non-Western cultures; Judeo-Christian mysticism; modernism and Romanticism; the natural and animal worlds; structuralist film; and the television and media world of his self-described \"seven-channel childhood.\"\n\nViola's presence is always manifested in images or reflections of himself. In early, performance-based exercises, including Migration (1976) and The Space Between the Teeth (1976), Viola began a systematic mapping of specific optical devices -- macro lens, the zoom -- to explore modes of seeing and perceiving reflections of the self. With The Reflecting Pool (1977-80), which describes \"the stages of a personal journey through images of transition,\" Viola employs increasingly sophisticated manipulations of time and light as metaphysical constructs. Astonishing alterations and transformations of reality and representation disrupt the viewer's expectations of visual and temporal causality.\n\nOne of the culminating expressions of Viola's artistic project, I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like (1986) unfolds as an epic quest for transcendence and self-knowledge through a symbolic rendering of animal and spiritual consciousness. This highly allegorical work includes a vision that is emblematic of Viola's artistic project: a self-image reflected in an owl's eye.\n\nViola is best known for his significant body of work in multi-media installation, in which he extends his symbolic language of images and sound into dramatic, theatrical articulations.\n\nViola was born in 1951. He received a B.F.A. from the College of Visual and Performing Arts, Syracuse University, in 1973. While there, he was an instrumental participant in the Synapse Video Center, one of the first alternative media centers in New York State. In 1973, he and several musicians formed the Composers Inside Electronics Group; in 1975, he became technical director of Art/Tapes/22, an artists' production studio in Florence, Italy. From 1976 until 1980, Viola was artist-in- residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York; he was artist-in-residence at the Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Japan, in 1980.\n\nViola has received numerous awards, including a United States/Japan Exchange Fellowship in 1980; a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1982; a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1985; the Polaroid Video Art Award in 1985; National Endowment for the Arts awards in 1978, 1983, 1986, and 1989; and the American Film Institute's Maya Deren Award for Independent Film and Video in 1987. In 1989, he was the recipient of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award.\n\nViola's videotapes and installations have been shown widely throughout the world, in major group exhibitions at festivals and institutions including Kolnischer Kunstverein, Cologne; Documenta VI, Kassel, Germany; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; and the Venice Biennale. He has also had one-person shows at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; ARC/Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; and the Contemporary Art Museum, Houston, among other institutions. Bill Viola was chosen to represent the United States at the 46th Venice Biennale, which is the oldest and most reknowned international contemporary arts festival. Five video and sound installations were created specifically by Viola for the Bienniale's United States Pavillion. He was the subject of a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Amerian Art in 1998.\n\nViola lives in Long Beach, California.\n\nReferences:\nInformation, 1973, 30 min, color, sound\nRed Tape -- Collected Works, 1975, 30 min, color, sound\nPlaying Soul Music to My Freckles, 2:46 min.\nA Non-Dairy Creamer, 5:19 min.\nThe Semi-Circular Canals, 8:51 min.\nA Million Other Things (2), 4:35 min.\nReturn, 7:15 min.\nFour Songs, 1976, 33 min, color, sound\nJunkyard Levitation, 3:11 min.\nSongs of Innocence, 9:34 min.\nThe Space Between the Teeth, 9:10 min.\nTruth Through Mass Individuation, 10:13 min.\nHe Weeps for You, 1976, installation: video, sound,\nMigration, 1976, 7 min, color, sound\nMemories of Ancestral Power (The Moro Movement in the Solomon Islands), 1977, 35:19 min, color, sound\nMemory Surfaces and Mental Prayers, 1977, 29 min, color, sound\nThe Wheel of Becoming, 7:40 min.\nThe Morning After the Night of Power, 10:44 min.\nSweet Light, 9:08 min.\nPalm Trees on the Moon, 1977, 26:06 min, color, sound\nThe Reflecting Pool - Collected Work, 1977-79, 62 min, color, sound\nThe Reflecting Pool, 1977-79, 7 min.\nMoonblood, 1977-79, 12:48 min.\nSilent Life, 1979, 13:14 min.\nAncient of Days, 1979-81, 12:21 min.\nVegetable Memory, 1978-80, 15:13 min.\nChott el-Djerid (A Portrait in Light and Heat), 1979, 28 min, color, sound\nSodium Vapor (including Constellation and Oracle), 1979, released 1986, 14:41 min, color, sound\nHatsu Yume (First Dream), 1981, 56 min, colour, sound\nAnthem, 1983, 11:30 min, color, sound\nReasons for Knocking at an Empty House, 1982, installation: video, sound, 19:11 min\nRoom for St. John of the Cross, 1983, installation: video, sound,\nReverse Television -- Portraits of Viewers (Compilation Tape), 1984, 15 min, color, sound\nI Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like, 1986, 89 min, colour, sound\nThe Passage, 1987, installation: video, sound\nThe Sleep of Reason, 1988, installation: video, sound\nAngel's Gate, 1989, 4:50 min, color, sound\nThe Passing, 1991, 54:13 min, b&w, sound\nThe Stopping Mind, 1991, installation: video, sound\nSlowly Turning Narrative, 1992, installation: video, sound\nThe Sleepers, 1992, installation: video, sound\nThe Greeting, 1992, installation: video, sound\nHeaven and Earth, 1992, installation: video, sound\nNantes Triptych, 1992, Video and mixed media\nTiny Deaths, 1993, installation: video, sound\nDeserts, 1994, 26 min, color, sound\nThe Veiling, 1995, installation: video, sound\nThe Crossing, 1996, installation: video, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:41:53.625798+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b79676ad-efeb-43d0-98b7-8e78ecf7da1a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110058", "external_references": [{"id": 26358, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q437616"}], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6413, "name": "Shelly Silver", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2064844, "title": "37 Stories about leaving home", "work_id": 107956, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064842, "title": "37 Stories about leaving home", "work_id": 107956, "role": "photographer", "role_id": 440, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2064839, "title": "37 Stories about leaving home", "work_id": 107956, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064837, "title": "37 Stories about leaving home", "work_id": 107956, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1913058, "title": "Meet the People", "work_id": 107957, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1913057, "title": "Meet the People", "work_id": 107957, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1913042, "title": "Meet the People", "work_id": 107957, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039219, "title": "Fragments", "work_id": 107958, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039220, "title": "Fragments", "work_id": 107958, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039221, "title": "April 2nd, 1993", "work_id": 107959, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "In Shelly Silver's enigmatic narratives of contemporary identity, truth and fiction are constantly in doubt, the veracity of what is seen and what is not seen is questioned, and the modes by which information is disclosed, withheld and mediated hold meaning. Appropriating the structures and codes of television and cinema narratives, Silver relies on the viewer's complicity -- the expectation of how media stories are \"read,\" the desire to believe and identify with their conventions and characters.\nBlurring authenticity and falseness, artifice and reality (\"real as compared to what?\" she asks), Silver often merges stylized black-and-white film with color video, fragmented images with written text and sound, elements of documentary and melodrama with comedy. From the elusive Things I Forget to Tell Myself (1988) to the multi-leveled melodrama of The Houses That Are Left (1990), her fragmented narratives are steeped in ironic inquiry. References to broadcast advertising and television formats are informed by Silver's experience as a commercial video editor. Investigating how contemporary identity is both reflected and constructed by television and cinema, Silver questions storytelling, role-playing and the means by which popular narratives articulate fictions of the self.\nIn recent years Silver has lived for extended periods outside of the United States. Her experiences as an \"outside observer\" in Germany, France, and Japan have led to works in which she questions the\nmyths and realities of cultural and national identity. Interweaving modes of documentary, essay, and story-telling in works such as Former East/Former West (1995) and 37 Stories About Leaving Home (1997), Silver explores how we negotiate cultural narratives to arrive at definitions of the self. Silver was born in 1957. She received a B.A. and a B.F.A. from Cornell University, and studied in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Media Bureau, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her works have been exhibited at festivals and institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork; The Kitchen, New York; Torino International Film and Video Festival, Italy; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; Berlin Film Festival; Artists Space, New\n York; The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Halle Sud, Geneva; and Laforet Art Museum, Tokyo.

Willfully primitive, often grotesque, and crafted with an ingenious visual shorthand, his psychodramatic landscapes of image and text are fabricated within the ironic vernacular of pop culture.\n\nOursler has worked in installation, painting, sculpture, and video since the mid-1970s. His recent mixed media installations, in which theatrical objects such as puppets and dolls are layered with video projections and spoken text, are prefigured in the wildly inventive body of videotapes that he has produced over the past twenty years.\n\nIn his videotapes, Oursler's idiosyncratic fictions take the form of bizarre narrative odysseys, horror-comedies that evoke Caligari by way of Eraserhead. Subjective visions of cultural and psychosexual delirium are pursued with outrageous black humor and a surreal theatricality.\n\nThe miniaturized, hand-constructed and painted mixed-media sets that are Oursler's signature suggest post-punk spectacles via German Expressionism; his somnambulant voiceovers and disorienting sound collages evoke stream-of-consciousness dreamstates. To enter one of his insular universes is to embark on a twisted journey that assumes the form and content of a hallucination of the contemporary collective unconscious. Strewn with the objects and idioms of adolescent fantasies, the detritus of mass cultural artifacts, and the macabre inversions of nightmares, Oursler's elaborate theatrical microcosms are populated by jerry-rigged props, hand-made puppets, found objects, body parts and, at times, human actors.\n\nFusing media-saturated artifice with primal obsessions, the iconography of his visual tableaux ranges from the biblical to the perverse; the language of his narrated texts is hilarious, irreverent and unexpectedly poetic. Utilizing low-tech gadgets to simulate and satirize video effects, his disjunctive fictions are haunted by themes of sexual alienation and hysteria, political and cultural violence, and the dichotomies of good and evil, life and death.\n\nEarly works, such as The Weak Bullet (1980) and Grand Mal (1981), have been described as \"half Jackson Pollack, half David Cronenberg, and as funny as [they are] paranoid.\" The faux-naivete of his visual and spoken tales belies the textual sophistication of his meta-language of pop culture and subversion of narrative modes.\n\nIn the late 1980s Oursler increasingly used his narrative and visual strategies to construct social critiques. His more recent installation works continue to explore a kind of macabre psychodramatic theater with pop cultural elements. Fantastic Prayers, a 1999 CD-ROM project that translates many of these themes into an interactive format, is a collaboration of Oursler, writer Constance DeJong and composer/musician Stephen Vitiello.\n\nOursler was born in 1957. He studied at Rockland Community College, Suffern, New York, and received a B.F.A. from the California Institute for the Arts, Valencia, where he studied under John Baldessari.\n\nIn 1999, a mid-career retrospective of Oursler's work will be held at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, and will tour to The Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston and Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.

He was awarded the Stalin Prizes for 1941 and 1950.\nInitially associated with Sergei Eisenstein, with whom he worked as a co-director, screenwriter and actor, Aleksandrov became a major director in his own right in the 1930s, when he directed Jolly Fellows and a string of other musical comedies starring his wife Lyubov Orlova.\nThough Aleksandrov remained active until his death, his musicals, amongst the first made in the Soviet Union, remain his most popular films. They rival Ivan Pyryev's films as the most effective and light-hearted showcase ever designed for the Stalin-era USSR.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:23:50.628499+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5850, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Aleksandrov"}], "uuid": "f75be685-41bb-4c8a-be67-377667dbd581", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20097", "external_references": [{"id": 33722, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q561459"}, {"id": 54589, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "50573190"}, {"id": 54590, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82090866"}, {"id": 54591, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82090866"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:23:54.724912+10:00"}

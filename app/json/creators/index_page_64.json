Rhall’s cultural background consists of Taungurung and colonial heritages – a state endemic to living in a colonised society – but goes by Taungurung when asked. His alter-ego Blak Metal is less defined and uses they/them pronouns.\n\nRhall’s art practice finds expression in ideas of institutional critique, interrogating modes of representation, classification and hierarchy both within and external to the art world(s). He works across various forms and interventions, including installation, performance, process led methodologies, curatorial projects, sculpture and art within the public realm. Many of his projects propose, explore and critique the exchange of economic and cultural capital found in the matrix of relations and intersections of First Nation art production, presentation and encounter.\n\nRhall recently concluded a five year tenure as lecturer for the Master of Contemporary Art programme at the Victorian College of the Arts and now, alongside his art practice, supports First Nations participants in the Statewide Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community Program. Rhall is also represented by MARS Gallery on Birrarung-ga land (Melbourne, Australia).", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T07:06:05.744260+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "706257c1-8f4c-4542-a547-ce3858f4f2b9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40387", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T07:06:05.744507+11:00"}, {"id": 86481, "name": "@Cmebacktoearth", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2719521, "title": "Max floating to songs", "work_id": 120311, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T04:08:42.269436+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "fe45413f-4761-439c-bc1c-6f64901e8294", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40384", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T07:05:38.820712+11:00"}, {"id": 86436, "name": "@paharikawa Pahari", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2719046, "title": "Random guy welcomes American protagonist", "work_id": 120295, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "@paharikawa", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T06:50:23.718926+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9c32d525-a88c-4443-8a60-c4e5b3360934", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40373", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T06:50:23.719243+11:00"}, {"id": 86434, "name": "James Turrell", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2717584, "title": "Raemar, Blue", "work_id": 120294, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1943", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "James Turrell (USA b.1943)\nJames Turrell, a major figure in contemporary art, creates enclosed spaces without objects: except, that is, for the intangible medium of light, with its manifold hues, shades and intensities. By merging light with the concept of space, questions arise about the complex nature of vision and about the limits and possibilities of the viewer's perception. Early works include aperture-like pieces, with light trapping hallways, acting as photographic darkrooms; many are simple, standard drywall constructions with commercial light fixtures. But the effects are compelling and highlight the nature of seeing: what appears to be a window, for example, becomes a physical skin of light holding onto to the wall. His largest exterior work is Roden Crater, 1972-c.2000 [http://www.rodencrater.org], a natural cinder volcano situated on the south western edge of the Painted Desert in northern Arizona. James Turrell is transforming the crater into a panoramic artwork that relates, through the medium of light, to the universe of the surrounding sky, desert landscape and local Hopi culture.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T06:01:54.947323+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "37508122-906e-4bab-b01a-bf0315d00f24", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110742", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T06:01:54.947541+11:00"}]}

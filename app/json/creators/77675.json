After his feature debut, Going in Style (1979), he directed the action comedies Beverly Hills Cop (1984) and Midnight Run (1988), which were critical and commercial hits. \nBrest then directed Scent of a Woman (1992), starring Al Pacino, who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. He followed it with Meet Joe Black (1998), which received mixed reviews. Brest's next film, Gigli (2003), was subject to a troubled production, in which the film was re-written and re-shot without his consent. It became one of the largest box office bombs in Hollywood history and received scathing reviews. As of 2023 it remains his most recent project.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:06:14.650857+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2657, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Brest"}], "uuid": "f0dadcd5-5cbd-45ea-9eab-60c1bc9b766a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24613", "external_references": [{"id": 11344, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q363117"}, {"id": 11345, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "27256528"}, {"id": 11346, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n93073149"}, {"id": 11347, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n93073149"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:48:59.508328+10:00"}

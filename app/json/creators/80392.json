He frequently collaborated with artists of other disciplines, including musicians John Cage, David Tudor, Brian Eno, and graphic artists Robert Rauschenberg, Bruce Nauman, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Frank Stella, and Jasper Johns; and fashion designer Rei Kawakubo. Works that he produced with these artists had a profound impact on avant-garde art beyond the world of dance.\nAs a choreographer, teacher, and leader of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Cunningham had a profound influence on modern dance. Many dancers who trained with Cunningham formed their own companies. They include Paul Taylor, Remy Charlip, Viola Farber, Charles Moulton, Karole Armitage, Deborah Hay, Robert Kovich, Foofwa d'Imobilité, Kimberly Bartosik, Flo Ankah, Jan Van Dyke, Jonah Bokaer, and Alice Reyes.\nIn 2009, the Cunningham Dance Foundation announced the Legacy Plan, a plan for the continuation of Cunningham's work and the celebration and preservation of his artistic legacy.Cunningham earned some of the highest honours bestowed in the arts, including the National Medal of Arts and the MacArthur Fellowship. He also received Japan's Praemium Imperiale and a British Laurence Olivier Award, and was named Officier of the Légion d'honneur in France.\nCunningham's life and artistic vision have been the subject of numerous books, films, and exhibitions, and his works have been presented by groups including the Paris Opéra Ballet, New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, White Oak Dance Project, and London's Rambert Dance Company.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:00:57.679011+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6024, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merce_Cunningham"}], "uuid": "ffe25f39-24c9-40a9-a409-0ec3c36d1fb7", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24943", "external_references": [{"id": 36973, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q318364"}, {"id": 55239, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "56747674"}, {"id": 55240, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83047112"}, {"id": 55241, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83047112"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:01:00.443103+10:00"}

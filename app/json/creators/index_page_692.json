In 1920 he worked at first as a film journalist, then as an assistant and extra in featurettes from Louis Feuillade. Florey moved to the United States in 1921. As a director, Florey's most productive decades were the 1930s and 1940s, working on relatively low-budget fillers for Paramount and Warner Brothers. His reputation is balanced between his avant-garde expressionist style, most evident in his early career, and his work as a fast, reliable studio-system director called on to finish troubled projects, such as 1939's Hotel Imperial.\nFlorey directed more than 50 films, the best known likely being the Marx Brothers first feature, The Cocoanuts (1929). His 1932 foray into Universal-style horror, Murders in the Rue Morgue, is regarded by horror fans as highly reflective of German expressionism. In 2006, as his 1937 film Daughter of Shanghai was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, Florey was called \"widely acclaimed as the best director working in major studio B-films\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:49:03.899581+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2978, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Florey"}], "uuid": "8f763d2f-cd17-46f9-860c-6605905a3512", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27725", "external_references": [{"id": 12648, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1349886"}, {"id": 12649, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117037952"}, {"id": 12650, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85148215"}, {"id": 12651, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85148215"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T00:41:32.023152+10:00"}, {"id": 78583, "name": "Joseph Santley", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2340499, "title": "The Cocoanuts", "work_id": 87610, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Joseph Mansfield", "date_of_birth": "1889-01-10", "date_of_death": "1971-08-08", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Joseph Mansfield Santley (born Joseph Ishmael Mansfield, January 10, 1890 – August 8, 1971) was an American actor, singer, dancer, writer, director, and producer of musical theatrical plays motion pictures and television shows.

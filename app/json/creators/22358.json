As an independent producer and director, he brought attention to topical social issues that most studios avoided. Among the subjects covered in his films were racism (in The Defiant Ones and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner), nuclear war (in On the Beach), greed (in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World), creationism vs. evolution (in Inherit the Wind) and the causes and effects of fascism (in Judgment at Nuremberg). His other films included High Noon (1952, as producer), The Caine Mutiny (1954, as producer),  and Ship of Fools (1965).\nDirector Steven Spielberg described him as an \"incredibly talented visionary\", and \"one of our great filmmakers, not just for the art and passion he put on screen, but for the impact he has made on the conscience of the world.\" Kramer was recognized for his fierce independence as a producer-director, with author Victor Navasky writing that \"among the independents . . . none seemed more vocal, more liberal, more pugnacious than young Stanley Kramer.\" His friend, Kevin Spacey, during his acceptance speech at the 2015 Golden Globes, honored Kramer's work, calling him \"one of the great filmmakers of all time.\"Despite uneven critical reception, both then and now, Kramer's body of work has received many awards, including 16 Academy Awards and 80 nominations, and he was nominated nine times as either producer or director. In 1961, he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. In 1963, he was a member of the jury at the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival. In 1998, he was awarded the first NAACP Vanguard Award in recognition of \"the strong social themes that ran through his body of work\". In 2002, the Stanley Kramer Award was created, to be awarded to recipients whose work \"dramatically illustrates provocative social issues\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:08:09.562385+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3131, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kramer"}], "uuid": "560df83c-35bc-4908-90ee-8f3dc81674f2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12913", "external_references": [{"id": 13284, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q73136"}, {"id": 13285, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117395769"}, {"id": 13286, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n88068070"}, {"id": 13287, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n88068070"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:48.730256+10:00"}

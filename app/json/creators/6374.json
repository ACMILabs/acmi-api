Produced for the German television program Ten to Eleven, this series comprises an extraordinarily rich body of work that compliments and dialogues with Kluge's distinguished films. Traversing realms of desire and culture in the 19th and 20th centuries, these highly experimental works weave together eclectic scenarios that reference advertising, cinema, opera, and electronic communications, and culminate in an ironic critical discourse on fantasy, representation, and history.\n\nReferences:\nAntiques of Advertising, 1988, 15 min, b&w and color, sound\nBlue Hour Tango Time, 1988, 25 min, b&w and color, sound\nChanging Time (Quickly), 1988, 25 min, b&w and color, sound\nJapanclips, 1988, 21 min, b&w and color, sound\nMadame Butterfly Waits, 1988, 15 min, b&w and color, sound\nThe African Lady, or Love with a Fatal Outcome, 1988, 25 min, color, sound\nThe Eiffel Tower, King Kong, and the White Woman, 1988, 25 min, b&w and color, sound\nWhy Are You Crying, Antonio?, 1988, 25 min, color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-26T22:38:01.629128+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "39f5619e-cd83-4afe-a957-05d1e1405c82", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110042", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T22:38:01.629436+11:00"}

Born in Melbourne, she enrolled in a photography course at RMIT in 1961, where she and Annette Stephens were the only two women in the course. The two friends set up a small photography studio above a café on Little Collins Street. In 1965 she married landscape gardener Gordon Ford and they had two children, Ben and Emma Ford. Living on Laughing Waters Road in Eltham, they were part of the artistic community connected to Montsalvat on the outer edges of Melbourne. During this time, Sue took portraits of friends and artists John Perceval, Myra Skipper and Cliff and Marlene Pugh.\n\nHer solo first exhibition was held at Hawthorn City Gallery in 1971. She was awarded the Ilford Scholarship at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School (now VCA) in 1973 and the following year was the first Australian photographer to have a solo exhibition at the NGV, with her 'Time Series'. By 1975, now separated from her husband, Ford was exhibiting regularly, an active member of art collectives including the Women’s Art Group and involved in the experimental film community. She documented the artists and figures of her social milieu, including Micky Allan, Bonita Ely, Ponch Hawkes, Jenny Watson and Janine Burke, and captured the historic visit to the Ewing Gallery in Melbourne by curator and theorist Lucy Lippard.\n\nIn 1979, Ford was a founding member of feminist film collective Reel Women, which functioned as a non-hierarchical group facilitating the distribution and exhibition of feminist films. Her book of portraits, 'A Sixtieth of a Second: Portraits of Women 1961–1981' was published by the Experimental Art Foundation in 1987, following their exhibition as 'The Photobook of Women' at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1982. In 1988 Ford travelled to Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory to teach photography classes, and subsequently documented the Barunga Festival and events connected to the bicentenary.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:02:17.892989+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "4ca62212-2770-4644-aa6e-389cfb7f6b7e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110624", "external_references": [{"id": 26701, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q19975864"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:02:17.893281+11:00"}

Resonating with a highly metaphorical sensibility, Cho's single-channel tapes and installations are formalist, almost painterly explorations of subjectivity and the subconscious. The urban landscapes that Cho often depicts move with a continuous fluidity, shifting from dreamlike abstractions of light to fleeting reflections of the city. Figures, cars, and trains are mirrored and diffused through one another, silhouetted with a haunting anonymity that is echoed in the poetic texts and soundscapes that accompany each piece. These often tense meditations focus on the nature and cost of isolation and loneliness while integrating into a culture, landscape and language other than one's own.\n\nSeoungho Cho was born in 1959 in Seoul, South Korea. He received his B.A. and M.A. in Graphic Arts from Hong-Ik University, Korea, and an M.A. in video art from New York University. In 1998 he received a Rockefeller Foundation Media Arts Fellowship. He has received the \"Juror?s Citation\" at the 18th Annual Black Maria Film and Video Festival, the Jack Goodman Fellowship in New York, and was specially selected in the Korean Art Competition five years in a row. Cho received a residency at Banff Centre for the Arts, Alberta, Canada.\n\nCho's one-person exhibitions have included The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Philip Feldman Gallery, Oregon; Contemporary Art Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii; and The Knitting Factory, New York. His work has been shown in numerous international festivals and exhibitions, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia; Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; New York Video Festival; Pandaemonium '98, Lux Centre, London; Centro d'Art Santa Monica, Barcelona, Spain; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Kwangju Biennial, Korea; the Robert Flaherty Film Seminars; and Artists Space, New York. Cho's tapes have been broadcast nationally and internationally.

In Cahen's uniquely nuanced world, fiction and document alike are presented as metaphoric voyages of the imaginary, exquisite reveries that describe passages of time, place, memory and perception. Genres such as narrative and performance are expanded and transformed as he explores visual, aural and temporal transformations of represented reality.\n\nFrom the formal elegance of Cartes postales video (Video Postcards), 1984-86) to the intricate musical and visual transitions of Boulez-Repons, 1985), Cahen's work is characterized by a sophisticated application of electronic techniques that manipulate sound and image, space and temporality, resulting in subtle transmutations of the illusory and the real. Building on his extensive research in acoustics, music, and filmmaking, he plays with the textures of sound and image to restructure representational modes, from the optical to the sonic, from the \"picturesque\" photograph to the conventions of narrative cinema. Resonating with wit and charm, executed with technical precision, his works allude to both formal and thematic motifs of travel, movement, and transition. Cahen's dreamlike journeys depict fleeting glimpses of a transitory reality, transformed in time within the pictorial frame.\n\nRobert Cahen was born in Valence, France in 1945. He graduated from the Conservatoire National Superieur Musique de Paris, and was a member of the Groupe de Recherche Musicales de l'ORTF (the Office of French Radio and Television) from 1971-74. From 1973- 76, he was director of Experimental Video for ORTF/INA. Many of his film and video works have been produced in conjunction with Institut National Audiovisuel (INA), the French television production facility. His videotapes have been broadcast and exhibited internationally, at institutions and festivals including the Paris Biennale; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; American Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; International Center of Photography, New York; Documenta 8, Kassel, Germany; FestRio, Brazil; Tokyo Festival; and the Festival of Locarno, Italy.

From his seminal guerrilla television work of the late 1960s and his alternative regional portraits of the 1970s, to his recent public television productions, he brings a distinctive, personal approach to the documentary form that, in his words, \"warms up the cool medium of television.\"\n\nBlumberg's energetic works give voice to the individual and the community, as he discovers the idiosyncratic and extraordinary in America's regions and subcultures, foregrounding games, sports, music, dance and performance as celebrations of cultural expression. Works such as Pick Up Your Feet: The Double Dutch Show (1981) are recognized classics of the genre. His more recent tapes are finely-crafted collaborations with performance artists.\n\nIn 1969, Blumberg was a co-founder of one of the earliest video collectives, the countercultural Videofreex, which established Lanesville TV as an artists' low-power television station in New York State. He was also a central participant in the pioneering guerrilla television group TVTV, where, applying the portability of small-format video equipment to the alternative media coverage of political events, he developed his characteristic personal interview style and informal, video verite techniques. In 1984 Blumberg was selected for Esquire magazine's register of \"The Best of the New Generation.\"\n\n\nRecognition: Blumberg has been artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York, and the 1980 Winter Olympics, and produced and directed many programs for the 'Alive From Off Center' series of KTCA TV, Minneapolis. He has received funding from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, among others.

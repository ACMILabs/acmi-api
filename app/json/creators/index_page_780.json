A stage, film, and television star, during her 60-year professional career she was known for her strong, realistic screen presence and versatility.  She was a favorite of directors, including Cecil B. DeMille, Fritz Lang, and Frank Capra, and made 85 films in 38 years before turning to television.\nOrphaned at the age of four and partially raised in foster homes, she always worked. One of her directors, Jacques Tourneur, said of her, \"She only lives for two things, and both of them are work.\" She made her debut on stage in the chorus as a Ziegfeld girl in 1923 at age 16, and within a few years was acting in plays. Her first lead role, which was in the hit Burlesque (1927), established her as a Broadway star. \nIn 1929, she began acting in talking pictures. Frank Capra chose her for his romantic drama Ladies of Leisure (1930). This led to additional leading roles which raised her profile, such as Night Nurse (1931), Baby Face (1933), and the controversial The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933). In 1937, she played the title role in Stella Dallas, for which she earned her first Academy Award nomination for best actress. In 1939, she starred in Union Pacific. In 1941, she starred in two screwball comedies: Ball of Fire with Gary Cooper, and The Lady Eve with Henry Fonda. She received her second Academy Award nomination for Ball of Fire, and in the decades since its release The Lady Eve has come to be regarded as a comedic classic, with Stanwyck's performance called one of the best in American comedy. Other successful films during this period are Meet John Doe (1940) and You Belong to Me (1941), reteaming her with Cooper and Fonda, respectively. By 1944, Stanwyck had become the highest-paid actress in the United States. She starred with Fred MacMurray in the seminal film noir Double Indemnity (1944), playing the wife who persuades an insurance salesman to kill her husband, for which she received her third Oscar nomination. In 1945, she starred as a homemaker columnist in the hit romantic comedy Christmas in Connecticut. The next year, she portrayed the title tragic femme fatale in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. She garnered her fourth Oscar nomination for her performance as an invalid wife in the noir-thriller Sorry, Wrong Number (1948). Stanwyck’s film career declined by the start of the 1950s, despite having a fair number of leading and major supporting roles in the decade, the most successful being Executive Suite (1954). \nShe transitioned to television by the 1960s, where she won three Emmy Awards, for The Barbara Stanwyck Show (1961), the western series The Big Valley (1966), and the miniseries The Thorn Birds (1983). \nShe received an Honorary Oscar in 1982, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1986 and several other honorary lifetime awards. She was ranked as the 11th greatest female star of classic American cinema by the American Film Institute.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:08:26.801879+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3607, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck"}], "uuid": "787b6ab6-3430-484a-92f2-7b7574ce278a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35237", "external_references": [{"id": 26753, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q94002"}, {"id": 27405, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "69121865"}, {"id": 27406, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83187397"}, {"id": 27407, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83187397"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:53:20.999109+10:00"}, {"id": 77708, "name": "Gary Cooper", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2107185, "title": "Ball of fire", "work_id": 84667, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Frank James Cooper", "date_of_birth": "1901-05-07", "date_of_death": "1961-05-13", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American actor known for his strong, quiet screen persona and understated acting style. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor twice and had a further three nominations, as well as an Academy Honorary Award in 1961 for his career achievements. He was one of the top-10 film personalities for 23 consecutive years and one of the top money-making stars for 18 years. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper at number 11 on its list of the 25 greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema.\nCooper's career spanned 36 years, from 1925 to 1961, and included leading roles in 84 feature films. He was a major movie star from the end of the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range included roles in most major film genres. His ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his natural and authentic appearance on screen. Throughout his career, he sustained a screen persona that represented the ideal American hero.\nCooper began his career as a film extra and stunt rider, but soon landed acting roles. After establishing himself as a Western hero in his early silent films, he appeared as the Virginian and became a movie star in 1929 with his first sound picture, The Virginian. In the early 1930s, he expanded his heroic image to include more cautious characters in adventure films and dramas such as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935). During the height of his career, Cooper portrayed a new type of hero, a champion of the common man in films such as Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Pride of the Yankees (1942), and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943). He later portrayed more mature characters at odds with the world in films such as The Fountainhead (1949) and High Noon (1952). In his final films, he played nonviolent characters searching for redemption in films such as Friendly Persuasion (1956) and Man of the West (1958).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:54:02.259059+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4011, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper"}], "uuid": "1525b4e8-0c88-472d-b21c-037441fadfaf", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "32671", "external_references": [{"id": 26751, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q93957"}, {"id": 28512, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "64191304"}, {"id": 28513, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79116412"}, {"id": 28514, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79116412"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:57:37.792380+10:00"}, {"id": 77707, "name": "Mark Boyman", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2181261, "title": "Dead ringers", "work_id": 84666, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:53:19.718326+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "408dea15-cea1-4973-9332-d413d71b0d8e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24468", "external_references": [{"id": 33188, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121091225"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:45:15.126828+10:00"}, {"id": 77706, "name": "Alan Jaggs", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475669, "title": "The October man", "work_id": 84661, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1918-02-19", "date_of_death": "2008-04-28", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Alan Jaggs (1918–2008) was a British film editor.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:20:31.456117+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5658, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jaggs"}], "uuid": "c5413ca4-6239-49d8-8d92-32c57d3f3309", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37950", "external_references": [{"id": 51911, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q28553425"}, {"id": 53890, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "250653909"}, {"id": 53891, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2012081911"}, {"id": 53892, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2012081911"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:20:31.477433+10:00"}, {"id": 77705, "name": "Erwin Hillier", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475668, "title": "The October man", "work_id": 84661, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1911-09-02", "date_of_death": "2005-01-10", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Erwin Hillier (2 September 1911 – 10 January 2005) was a German-born cinematographer known for his work in British cinema from the 1940s to 1960s.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T19:36:34.330460+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3951, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Hillier"}], "uuid": "03f96e13-5eb8-4fd5-a785-88493f36d11d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37949", "external_references": [{"id": 26750, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q91195"}, {"id": 28352, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "71595675"}, {"id": 28353, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2007049768"}, {"id": 28354, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2007049768"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:36:36.403337+10:00"}, {"id": 77704, "name": "Robert Mitchum", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2476602, "title": "Thirty seconds over Tokyo", "work_id": 84660, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Robert Charles Durman Mitchum", "date_of_birth": "1917-08-06", "date_of_death": "1997-07-01", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Robert Charles Durman Mitchum (August 6, 1917 – July 1, 1997) was an American actor.

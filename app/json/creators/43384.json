"biography": "The Anderson family home movies show early Ballarat taken on 9.5mm and 16mm film by local film enthusiast John (Jack) Robert Anderson, who went on to become the owner of the Regent Cinema, Ballarat, Victoria.\n\nBefore Jack got into the movie business, he was a filmmaker himself, capturing, in particular, the enthusiasm of youth through his 9.5mm camera. Ballarat’s Sturt Street in an era when there were trams, the marble monument of Queen Victoria, Botanical Gardens, Lake Wendouree and the Town Hall – from the point of view of young Jack and his friends. They venture out on picnics, go to the races dressed in all their finery, enjoy the muddy fun of the Ballarat Harley motorbike ‘Mud Scramble’ and their own motorbike sojourns to neighbouring towns and picturesque countryside.\n\nFeatured here are his home movies taken on the film format 9.5mm. The sprocket holes are in the centre of the frame and if a projector damages the sprocket holes, unfortunately the image is also damaged. Having the sprocket holes run along the side of the image prevents this.\n\nJack developed a love of cinema early in life when, in the 1930s, he would collect film offcuts from shows at the local town hall, splice them together and show them to friends through a magic lantern image projector (for the price of a beer bottle).\n\nJack’s film enthusiasm grew after he enlisted in the Australian Army and experienced both the open air cinemas of northern Australia and had the opportunity to photograph RAAF aircraft. During this time he would often accompany pilots, taking photographs that showed the wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.\n\nAfter the Army, Jack returned to Ballarat, working at a photographic studio where he met Marie Bourke who became his wife and business collaborator. It was at this time that Jack starting filming local activities and events.\n\nJack and Marie enjoyed a model of collaborative family business operation as shown by the establishment of ‘Radio Cabs’ in Ballarat. Jack and a number of his fellow taxi operators decided to form a co-operative where all their taxi services could be centralised, radio fitted and dispatched. While the husbands drove fares all over the city, wives and family would control the operation back at base.\n\nHaving established one successful business, Jack pursued his love of cinema and he and Marie would eventually create a film distribution circuit across regional Victoria, using specialised 16mm projectors and screens. Once they hired the films, they would set off to halls and venues in regional Victoria such as Clunes, Newstead and Hall’s Gap. Marie’s sister Monica and her husband Dick Sullivan would travel with them to help run the show and sell concession items.\n\nJack and Marie (partnering with others) would go on to establish cinemas such as the ‘Astor Cinema’ in Ararat, ‘Bell Post Hill Drive-In’, Geelong and the ‘Southern and Northern Drive-Ins’ and ‘Vegas 70 Cinema’ in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the ‘Regent Theatre’ in Ballarat which became the first multiplex in regional Victoria.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-17T03:35:21.694039+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "74d49a03-3b89-4753-96f8-d6ae5a4415c1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38911", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}

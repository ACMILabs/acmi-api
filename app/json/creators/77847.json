Douglas came to prominence in the 1930s as a suave leading man, perhaps best typified by his performance in the romantic comedy Ninotchka (1939) with Greta Garbo. Douglas later played mature and fatherly characters, as in his Academy Award-winning performances in Hud (1963) and Being There (1979) and his Academy Award–nominated performance in I Never Sang for My Father (1970). Douglas was one of 24 performers to win the Triple Crown of Acting. In the last few years of his life Douglas appeared in films with supernatural stories involving ghosts, including The Changeling in 1980 and Ghost Story in 1981, his last completed film role.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:00:24.340149+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6023, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Douglas"}], "uuid": "c2de84d1-1ef5-4f1f-a403-f487a9ad245d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33028", "external_references": [{"id": 37780, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q312084"}, {"id": 55236, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "49412354"}, {"id": 55237, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82225118"}, {"id": 55238, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82225118"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:00:28.549447+10:00"}

His film The Mattei Affair won the Palme d'Or at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Rosi's films, especially those of the 1960s and 1970s, often appeared to have political messages. While the topics for his later films became less politically oriented and more angled toward literature, he continued to direct until 1997, his last film being the adaptation of Primo Levi's book, The Truce.\nAt the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival 13 of his films were screened, in a section reserved for film-makers of outstanding quality and achievement. He received the Honorary Golden Bear for Lifetime Achievement, accompanied by the screening of his 1962 film Salvatore Giuliano. In 2012 the Venice Biennale awarded Rosi the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:27:50.476546+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2040, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Rosi"}], "uuid": "011daa74-587c-473d-b41a-3d1d38e2b559", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "19035", "external_references": [{"id": 8807, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q53050"}, {"id": 8808, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "98162929"}, {"id": 8809, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50075860"}, {"id": 8810, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50075860"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:29:23.072514+10:00"}

Born in Melbourne, she enrolled in a photography course at RMIT in 1961, where she and Annette Stephens were the only two women in the course. The two friends set up a small photography studio above a café on Little Collins Street. In 1965 she married landscape gardener Gordon Ford and they had two children, Ben and Emma Ford. Living on Laughing Waters Road in Eltham, they were part of the artistic community connected to Montsalvat on the outer edges of Melbourne. During this time, Sue took portraits of friends and artists John Perceval, Myra Skipper and Cliff and Marlene Pugh.\n\nHer solo first exhibition was held at Hawthorn City Gallery in 1971. She was awarded the Ilford Scholarship at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School (now VCA) in 1973 and the following year was the first Australian photographer to have a solo exhibition at the NGV, with her 'Time Series'. By 1975, now separated from her husband, Ford was exhibiting regularly, an active member of art collectives including the Women’s Art Group and involved in the experimental film community. She documented the artists and figures of her social milieu, including Micky Allan, Bonita Ely, Ponch Hawkes, Jenny Watson and Janine Burke, and captured the historic visit to the Ewing Gallery in Melbourne by curator and theorist Lucy Lippard.\n\nIn 1979, Ford was a founding member of feminist film collective Reel Women, which functioned as a non-hierarchical group facilitating the distribution and exhibition of feminist films. Her book of portraits, 'A Sixtieth of a Second: Portraits of Women 1961–1981' was published by the Experimental Art Foundation in 1987, following their exhibition as 'The Photobook of Women' at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1982. In 1988 Ford travelled to Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory to teach photography classes, and subsequently documented the Barunga Festival and events connected to the bicentenary.",

works which explore the ¿language of computers¿. During the past ten years, he has combined computer animation, generative systems, multimedia design and interactivity to create virtual worlds. These worlds are a means of collecting together objects, characters and icons that are influenced by video games, electronic music, and digital aesthetics. In his work, Innocent explores the dynamic between the iconic ideal and the personal specific, the real and the simulated, and the way in which our identity is shaped by our language and communication.\n\nIn 1991 Innocent completed his Graduate Diploma of Art in Graphic Design at Swinburne University, and a Post Graduate Diploma of Animation and Interactive Multimedia the following year. During the early 90¿s he collaboratively produced a number of installation and video works as Cyberdada. In 1994, Idea-ON>!, a CD-ROM exploring the nature of electronic space was exhibited at Siggraph and ISEA. PsyVision, a 50 minute computer animation, was completed in 1996. This work developed a visual language of iconic figuration and synthetic abstraction that had a synaesthetic relationship with it¿s electronic soundtrack.\n\nIconica, first exhibited at Siggraph in 1998, is an interactive installation that an artificial world made of language. The icons of this language relate to unique pictorial styles and soundscapes used to represent the world, and may be combined using grammatical rules to create new meanings. These icons form the basis an artificial life model which determines the behaviour and evolution of the world. The work explores the multiplicity of electronic space: simultaneously a cyberspace, a mindspace, an abstract world and a stylised reality.\n\nInnocent is currently Senior Lecturer in the Department of Design at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, and is producing Evolglyph, an interactive virtual world that generates iconic forms. This work has been commissioned by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image at Federation Square. He is also undertaking a Master of Arts investigating a model for digital media language.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:38:23.276131+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "ede9eb04-e680-4205-9f3f-97f5129be04c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110735", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

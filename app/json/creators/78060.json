She was one of the first female experimental filmmakers, and was the creator of some of the first electronically generated film images. Her specialty was visual music; while working in New York City between 1934 and 1958, Bute made fourteen short abstract musical films. Many of these were seen in regular movie theaters, such as Radio City Music Hall, usually preceding a prestigious film. Several of her abstract films were part of her Seeing Sound series.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T22:51:38.524675+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6013, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Bute"}], "uuid": "25e9afb0-d45e-449e-a8e3-6fa71fca8d83", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24743", "external_references": [{"id": 42570, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3296168"}, {"id": 55205, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "63922618"}, {"id": 55206, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr98027611"}, {"id": 55207, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr98027611"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:51:38.546545+10:00"}

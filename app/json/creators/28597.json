He was perhaps most known for his 1982 hit black comedy Eating Raoul, which he wrote, starred in and directed.\nBartel appeared in over 90 movies and TV episodes, including such titles as Eat My Dust (1976), Hollywood Boulevard (1976), Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), Get Crazy (1983) and Amazon Women on the Moon (1987). He frequently co-starred with friend and former Warhol girl Mary Woronov; the pair appeared in 17 films together, often as husband and wife.\nBartel also directed 11 low-budget films, many of which he also acted in or wrote. He started in 1968 with the short The Secret Cinema, a paranoid delusional fantasy of self-referential cinema.  He graduated to features in 1972 with the horror-comedy Private Parts.  He would go on to direct such cult films as Death Race 2000 (1975), Eating Raoul (1982), Lust in the Dust (1985) and Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills (1989).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:39:08.617469+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2823, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bartel"}], "uuid": "d06d27f4-480c-4d40-a350-d1e01ab02b60", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "26172", "external_references": [{"id": 12023, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1651660"}, {"id": 12024, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "76503236"}, {"id": 12025, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n92107054"}, {"id": 12026, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n92107054"}], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T20:32:42.176996+11:00"}

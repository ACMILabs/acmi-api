The university's main campus is in Perth, the state capital. UWA was established in 1911 by an act of the Parliament of Western Australia.UWA is the oldest university in the state of Western Australia (WA) and is the sixth-oldest university in Australia. Because of its age and reputation, UWA is classed as one of the \"sandstone universities\", an informal designation given to the oldest university in each state. \nUWA is a member of the prestigious Group of Eight, which consists of the eight most research intensive and best ranked Australian universities. UWA is also a member of the international Matariki Network of Universities. \nUWA is ranked in the world's top 100 universities, according to several highly respected publications. Another defining characteristic of UWA is that it has retained its Convocation as an integral part of its governance structure. All graduates of UWA are automatically life-long members of the university through Convocation which grants them the right to attend the Annual General Meetings, to elect two members of the UWA Senate and to review any changes to University legislation. \nGraduates of UWA include Prime Minister of Australia (Bob Hawke), five Justices of the High Court of Australia (including Chief Justice, Robert French, now Chancellor), Governor of the Reserve Bank (H. C. Coombs), various federal cabinet ministers, and seven of Western Australia's eight most recent premiers. In 2018 alumnus mathematician Akshay Venkatesh was a recipient of the Fields Medal. As of 2021, the university had produced 106 Rhodes Scholars. Two members of the UWA faculty, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won Nobel Prizes as a result of research at the university.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T02:01:41.559715+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6237, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Australia"}], "uuid": "1b1eec88-b265-4854-be99-8603221a196f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4431", "external_references": [{"id": 51144, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1517021"}, {"id": 56016, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "146292670"}, {"id": 56017, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79089340"}, {"id": 56018, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79089340"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:46:38.897546+11:00"}, {"id": 21910, "name": "Dick Zimmerman", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2172020, "title": "Jan Stephenson's How to Golf", "work_id": 79391, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:37:32.130596+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f8068da1-fdab-4cef-beb5-df9177608a19", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18131", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 21905, "name": "Dept Immigration and Ethnic Affairs", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2379710, "title": "Immigration: the waves that shaped Australia", "work_id": 79382, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-07-19T03:36:35.539112+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "970ae7b0-ed1c-4b85-aebc-a40862bd9cf5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "7481", "external_references": [{"id": 39559, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121299122"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:09:26.095630+10:00"}, {"id": 21903, "name": "Victorian Health Foundation", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2401702, "title": "Autism : The Early Signs", "work_id": 79371, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-11T14:30:15.683542+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "cdd238da-dd6e-4aa2-8455-d71d82d64c4d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14077", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-11T14:30:15.683804+10:00"}, {"id": 21900, "name": "Nicholas Meyer", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1997010, "title": "Time after time", "work_id": 93068, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2309046, "title": "Star trek II: the wrath of Khan", "work_id": 87859, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984082, "title": "The Day After", "work_id": 79369, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2778112, "title": "The Pied piper of Hamelin", "work_id": 81935, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1945-12-24", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Nicholas Meyer (born December 24, 1945) is an American writer and director, known for his best-selling novel The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, and for directing the films Time After Time, two of the Star Trek feature films, the 1983 television film The Day After, and the 1999 HBO original film Vendetta.\nMeyer was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the film The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976), where he adapted his own novel into a screenplay.

The producer of the song, Mike Thorne, disputed this and stated that the lyrics originally had Mann singing to another woman, though the sex was changed owing to pressure from the record label.Hausman later became a talent manager, representing Mann and other artists, including Michael Penn, Skeleton Key and Pete Droge. In addition to Mann, his current roster includes Suzanne Vega, Marc Cohn, Amanda Palmer, Kristina Train, The Both, and Christina Courtin. Hausman, along with Mann and Penn, founded the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created.

Pakula films (including All the President's Men), four James Bridges films, and all three films from Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather series.\nFellow cinematographer William A. Fraker called Willis's work a \"milestone in visual storytelling\", while one critic suggested that Willis \"defined the cinematic look of the 1970s: sophisticated compositions in which bolts of light and black put the decade's moral ambiguities into stark relief\".

Make Room! (1966). The latter was the rough basis for the motion picture Soylent Green (1973). Long resident in both Ireland and the United Kingdom, Harrison was involved in the foundation of the Irish Science Fiction Association, and was, with Brian Aldiss, co-president of the Birmingham Science Fiction Group.\nAldiss called him \"a constant peer and great family friend\". His friend Michael Carroll said of Harrison's work: \"Imagine Pirates of the Caribbean or Raiders of the Lost Ark, and picture them as science-fiction novels. They're rip-roaring adventures, but they're stories with a lot of heart.\" Novelist Christopher Priest wrote in an obituary\n\nHarrison was an extremely popular figure in the SF world, renowned for being amiable, outspoken and endlessly amusing. His quickfire, machine-gun delivery of words was a delight to hear, and a reward to unravel: he was funny and self-aware, he enjoyed reporting the follies of others, he distrusted generals, prime ministers and tax officials with sardonic and cruel wit, and above all he made plain his acute intelligence and astonishing range of moral, ethical and literary sensibilities.", "biography_author":

Back in England, York started a business in London, in 1863, and soon built up an international reputation for the high quality of his magic lantern slides, being his favourite side of the business. His son William joined him in 1877. By the 1890s the production of York & Son exceeded 100,000 slides per year and by 1900 even more than 140,000.\n\nSlides from 1890 are identifiable by their trade mark, a ‘Y’ with a snake entwined, set in a triangle. Their catalogues covered every subject, like Travel, Comic, Science, Education and Life Model series, which were produced with particular dedication. Their resident scenic painter and stage manager E. T. Green provided the very elaborate backdrops.\n\nAfter Frederick’s death in 1903, his son carried on as a manager, but due to the waning popularity of the magic lantern the business formally dissolved in 1907. Later on the company was taken over by Newton & Co. The new owner closed the existing premises and opened York House in South Kensington. New slides were produced, but also the complete back catalogue of York & Sons was still available.

The company was founded by Philip Carpenter (18 November 1776, Kidderminster – 20 April 1833, London)[1] and, after his death, was continued by his sister Mary Carpenter alongside former apprentice William Westley.[2] The company's contribution to the development of magic lanterns was significant and Philip Carpenter pioneered the use of copperplate slides.[3]\n\nMagic lanterns had widely been used for entertainment towards the end of the 18th Century, particularly in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, and became more publicly available in the early 1800s. The lantern slides had to be individually hand painted, a time-consuming and costly process, until Carpenter developed a method to mass-produce them using a copper plate printing process. This enabled outline images to be repeatedly printed onto glass and thus create reproducible sets of slides. These outline images could be more easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale. The production of this imagery allowed people to look at magic lanterns in a new way, giving the potential for use in education and other fields. Popular topics included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world.[3] The first known set was completed by 1823 showing a number of zoological subjects, followed by astronomical slides. These slides were for the day very good but Carpenter and Westley's slides would in time become highly regarded for their detail.[4] To accompany the slide sets Carpenter produced detailed notes in script form allowing presenters to show the images while running through a prescribed text.\n\nCarpenter focused on the manufacture of magic lanterns for several years and was successful enough to relocate the business. In 1826 he moved to Regent Street and opened \"The Microcosm\", a public gallery and shop centred on microscopes.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-19T22:37:44.213806+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "daeb5e1b-d0fd-4308-8d2f-ff99b3966f8f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39329", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-19T22:37:44.214127+11:00"}, {"id": 70592, "name": "G.M.

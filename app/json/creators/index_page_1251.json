The company was founded by Philip Carpenter (18 November 1776, Kidderminster – 20 April 1833, London)[1] and, after his death, was continued by his sister Mary Carpenter alongside former apprentice William Westley.[2] The company's contribution to the development of magic lanterns was significant and Philip Carpenter pioneered the use of copperplate slides.[3]\n\nMagic lanterns had widely been used for entertainment towards the end of the 18th Century, particularly in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, and became more publicly available in the early 1800s. The lantern slides had to be individually hand painted, a time-consuming and costly process, until Carpenter developed a method to mass-produce them using a copper plate printing process. This enabled outline images to be repeatedly printed onto glass and thus create reproducible sets of slides. These outline images could be more easily and quickly hand painted ready for sale. The production of this imagery allowed people to look at magic lanterns in a new way, giving the potential for use in education and other fields. Popular topics included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world.[3] The first known set was completed by 1823 showing a number of zoological subjects, followed by astronomical slides. These slides were for the day very good but Carpenter and Westley's slides would in time become highly regarded for their detail.[4] To accompany the slide sets Carpenter produced detailed notes in script form allowing presenters to show the images while running through a prescribed text.\n\nCarpenter focused on the manufacture of magic lanterns for several years and was successful enough to relocate the business. In 1826 he moved to Regent Street and opened \"The Microcosm\", a public gallery and shop centred on microscopes.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-19T22:37:44.213806+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "daeb5e1b-d0fd-4308-8d2f-ff99b3966f8f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39329", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-19T22:37:44.214127+11:00"}, {"id": 70592, "name": "G.M.

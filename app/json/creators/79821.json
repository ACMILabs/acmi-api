He is known for his vocal quality, poetic lyrics and unique stage presence.\nPossessing a distinctive voice, Stipe has been noted for the \"mumbling\" style of his early career. Since the mid-1980s, Stipe has sung in \"wailing, keening, arching vocal figures\" that R.E.M. biographer David Buckley compared to Celtic folk artists and Muslim muezzin. He was in charge of R.E.M.'s visual aspect, often selecting album artwork and directing many of the band's music videos. Outside the music industry, he owns and runs two film production studios, C-00 and Single Cell Pictures.\nAs a member of R.E.M., Stipe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. As a singer-songwriter, Stipe influenced a wide range of artists, including Kurt Cobain of Nirvana and Thom Yorke of Radiohead. Bono of U2 has described his voice as \"extraordinary\", and Yorke told The Guardian that Stipe is his favorite lyricist, saying \"I loved the way he would take an emotion and then take a step back from it and in doing so make it so much more powerful.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:16:20.336505+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4714, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stipe"}], "uuid": "372ef8c7-dddc-4b40-9888-bdbfb58ae637", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25234", "external_references": [{"id": 25470, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q215182"}, {"id": 30365, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84964040"}, {"id": 30366, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91125827"}, {"id": 30367, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91125827"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:09:56.001139+10:00"}

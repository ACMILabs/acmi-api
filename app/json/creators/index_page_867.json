She began her acting career in theatre, and in 1944 made her first film for MGM.\nDespite a featured role in It's a Wonderful Life (1946), MGM did not believe she had the potential for major success, and sold her contract to RKO Studios. Often cast in film noir projects, Grahame was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Crossfire (1947), and later won the award for her work in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952). After starring opposite Humphrey Bogart in In A Lonely Place (1950), she achieved her highest profile with Sudden Fear (1952), The Big Heat (1953), Human Desire (1954), and Oklahoma! (1955), but her film career began to wane soon afterwards.\nGrahame returned to work on the stage, but continued to appear in films and television productions, usually in supporting roles.\nIn 1974, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It went into remission less than a year later and Grahame returned to work. In 1980, the cancer returned, but Grahame refused to accept the diagnosis or seek treatment. Choosing instead to continue working, she traveled to the United Kingdom to appear in a play. Her health, however, declined rapidly. She returned to New York City, where she died in October 1981, aged 57.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:15:45.767080+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4080, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Grahame"}], "uuid": "426a368e-76c2-42f7-930c-cce42bc316ca", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38201", "external_references": [{"id": 26716, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q59314"}, {"id": 28700, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "48684"}, {"id": 28701, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86036599"}, {"id": 28702, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86036599"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:15:48.078000+10:00"}, {"id": 76834, "name": "Gordon MacRae", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2476427, "title": "Oklahoma!", "work_id": 81198, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1921-03-12", "date_of_death": "1986-01-24", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Albert Gordon MacRae (March 12, 1921 – January 24, 1986) was an American actor, singer, and television and radio host.

While critically acclaimed for many different roles throughout her career, she is widely known for playing the part of Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939). She attained international stardom as an actress in both musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist, and on the concert stage. Renowned for her versatility, she received an Academy Juvenile Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Special Tony Award. Garland was the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, which she won for her 1961 live recording titled Judy at Carnegie Hall.Garland began performing as a child with her two older sisters, in a vaudeville group \"The Gumm Sisters\" and was later signed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a teenager. She appeared in more than two dozen films for MGM. Garland was a frequent on-screen partner of both Mickey Rooney and Gene Kelly and regularly collaborated with director and second husband Vincente Minnelli. Other starring roles during this period included Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), The Harvey Girls (1946), Easter Parade (1948), and Summer Stock (1950). In 1950, after 15 years with MGM, the studio released her amid a series of personal struggles that prevented her from fulfilling the terms of her contract.\nAlthough her film career became intermittent thereafter, two of Garland's most critically acclaimed roles came later in her career: she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in A Star Is Born (1954) and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Judgment at Nuremberg (1961). She also made record-breaking concert appearances, released eight studio albums and hosted her own Emmy-nominated television series, The Judy Garland Show (1963–1964). At age 39, Garland became the youngest and first female recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in the film industry. In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Several of her recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and in 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her as the eighth-greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema.Garland struggled in her personal life from an early age. The pressures of early stardom affected her physical and mental health from the time she was a teenager; her self-image was influenced by constant criticism from film executives who believed that she was physically unattractive and who manipulated her onscreen physical appearance. Throughout her adulthood she abused drugs and alcohol. She had financial troubles, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes. Her lifelong substance use disorder ultimately led to her death from an accidental barbiturate overdose in 1969, at age 47.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography":

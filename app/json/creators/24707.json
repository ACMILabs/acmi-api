Burroughs, The Clash, the Avengers, Mark Pauline, Survival Research Labs, The Go-Go's, John Cooper Clarke, Bauhaus, X, The Dils, Johanna Went, Talking Heads, Black Flag, Flipper, D.O.A and Crucifix were recorded in the late 1970s to the early 1980s. In addition, videos often included interviews with members of the bands. \nTarget Video filmed a performance by The Cramps and The Mutants at Napa State Hospital on June 13, 1978, in which the bands performed for an audience of mental patients. Forty years later, Rolling Stone described the performance as \"legendary\" and \"a landmark moment for punk rock\". Despite being attended by only 100 people, mostly patients, the recording of the show became an underground sensation.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:41:39.736081+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6208, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Video"}], "uuid": "90f54825-c3eb-4d2c-b06a-ed177a9cf63f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "13165", "external_references": [{"id": 41477, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7685882"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:41:39.755409+10:00"}

Alex began a lifelong involvement in the “rag trade”, running an import agency on the third floor at Tasmania House. He was a popular figure in “The Lane”, serving for some years as the President of the Victorian Softgoods Association.\n\nAlex always deeply respected Arthur Thomas, keeping a framed photo of Thomas on his desk until he retired. Thomas was a keen photographer and when he died in the 1930’s he left Alex his Agfa 16mm camera, his projector and collapsible screen, all of which Alex frequently used during the 1940’s and 1950’s. There were films galore: films of family at home and on holidays, of faraway places in his later years and local events. For example, he captured the excitement of the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne with footage of the decorated buildings in the city with the department stores of the era - Foy's, Buckley's, Myer, Coles and Woolworths. He was often asked to show his films at family events and other local gatherings.\n\nAlex suffered a serious stroke in 1960 which caused the sale of his business and the end of his photography. He died in 1968 and the film equipment passed to his son, Mac, who continued filming the comings and goings of his young family in the 1960’s to the early 1970’s. Mac valued the support shown to his father and in his way, supported others by becoming a well-respected teacher. The Nicoll Family collection of 16mm film was donated to us by Mac, to make them available to a wider audience.

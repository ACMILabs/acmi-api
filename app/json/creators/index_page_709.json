She began her career as a child actress in 1964, appearing in East of Sudan, Star!,  and two adaptations of The Railway Children—the BBC's 1968 television serial and the 1970 film version. In 1971 she also starred in the critically acclaimed film Walkabout  and the TV film The Snow Goose, for which she won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama.\nShe relocated to the United States in 1974 to pursue a Hollywood career and subsequently appeared in Logan's Run (1976), Amy (1981), An American Werewolf in London (1981), and Child's Play 2 (1990). During the same period, Agutter continued appearing in high-profile British films, such as The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Equus (1977)—for which she won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role)—and The Riddle of the Sands (1979). In 1981, she co-starred in The Survivor, an Australian adaptation of the James Herbert novel by that name, and was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.\nAfter returning to Britain in the early 1990s to pursue family life, Agutter shifted her focus to television, appearing in the 2000 version of television adaptation of The Railway Children, this time as the mother, and since 2012 she has had an ongoing role in the BBC's Call the Midwife. Her film work in recent years includes The Avengers (2012) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and in 2022, Agutter returned to the world of The Railway Children once more by reprising her role from the 1970 film 52 years later in a sequel, The Railway Children Return.\nAgutter is married, and has  one adult son. She supports several charitable causes, mostly ones related to cystic fibrosis, a condition from which her niece suffers, and for her service to those causes was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:29:46.831149+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4316, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Agutter"}], "uuid": "66e67bbc-de75-44c5-a437-21ad6b3c852c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31437", "external_references": [{"id": 25242, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q234883"}, {"id": 29341, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "72716030"}, {"id": 29342, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81075528"}, {"id": 29343, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81075528"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T21:20:52.635775+10:00"}, {"id": 78419, "name": "Max L.

He was one of the foremost creatives of the surrealist, avant-garde, and Dadaist movements; and one of the most influential figures in early 20th-century art as a whole. The National Observer suggested that, “of the artistic generation whose daring gave birth to Twentieth Century Art, Cocteau came closest to being a Renaissance man.”He is best known for his novels Le Grand Écart (1923), Le Livre Blanc (1928), and Les Enfants Terribles (1929); the stage plays La Voix Humaine (1930), La Machine Infernale (1934), Les Parents terribles (1938), La Machine à écrire (1941), and L'Aigle à deux têtes (1946); and the films The Blood of a Poet (1930), Les Parents Terribles (1948), Beauty and the Beast (1946), Orpheus (1950), and Testament of Orpheus (1960), which alongside Blood of a Poet and Orpheus constitute the so-called Orphic Trilogy. He was described as \"one of [the] avant-garde's most successful and influential filmmakers\" by AllMovie. Cocteau, according to Annette Insdorf, “left behind a body of work unequalled for its variety of artistic expression.”Though his body of work encompassed many different mediums, Cocteau insisted on calling himself a poet, classifying the great variety of his works – poems, novels, plays, essays, drawings, films – as \"poésie\", \"poésie de roman\", \"poésie de thêatre\", \"poésie critique\", \"poésie graphique\" and \"poésie cinématographique\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:55:35.927422+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2349, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau"}], "uuid": "7dcfe490-10db-43dc-a5aa-98ddcf397711", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1371", "external_references": [{"id": 10074, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q83158"}, {"id": 10075, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "12306661"}, {"id": 10076, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79007043"}, {"id": 10077, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79007043"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:34:43.953446+11:00"}

Like his contemporaries Norman Jewison and Ted Kotcheff, he was one of the earliest Canadian directors to achieve mainstream critical and financial success outside their native country at a time when its film industry was virtually nonexistent. He won a BAFTA Film Award and was nominated for a Palme d'Or for his work on the acclaimed spy thriller The Ipcress File (1965) starring Michael Caine.\nHe is considered by some an auteur director, elevating otherwise unremarkable genre films through strong, creative visuals, and atmospheric direction. His horror film The Entity (1982) was declared by director Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, and his Vietnam War film The Boys in Company C (1978) was a major influence on Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987). He is also the co-creator of the Iron Eagle action film franchise which began in 1986, and directed three of its four entries.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:05:43.216057+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3106, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_J._Furie"}], "uuid": "b2b158b8-734c-4d23-a791-21e1a7b95ac2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28807", "external_references": [{"id": 13180, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1359422"}, {"id": 13181, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "86205509"}, {"id": 13182, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n89631242"}, {"id": 13183, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n89631242"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:44.850886+10:00"}

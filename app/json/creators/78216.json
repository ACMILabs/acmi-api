He rose to prominence in the United Kingdom as a Shakespearean stage actor and went on to appear in more than 70 films, primarily costume dramas, swashbucklers, and, occasionally, horror films.\nRathbone frequently portrayed suave villains or morally ambiguous characters, such as Mr. Murdstone in David Copperfield (1935), Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet (1936) and Sir Guy of Gisbourne in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). His most famous role was that of Sherlock Holmes in fourteen Hollywood films made between 1939 and 1946 and in a radio series. His later career included roles on Broadway, as well as self-ironic film and television work. In 1948, he shared the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play with two others. He was also nominated for two Academy Awards and was honoured with three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T17:56:29.762021+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5702, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rathbone"}], "uuid": "13eec363-fa5b-452a-9240-4a115e88ad39", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 39904, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q336865"}, {"id": 54055, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "24788251"}, {"id": 54056, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85220633"}, {"id": 54057, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85220633"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:56:32.572484+10:00"}

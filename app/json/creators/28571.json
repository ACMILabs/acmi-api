He won the Grand Prix du Festival at the Cannes Film Festival twice: in 1946 for Torment (Swedish: Hets) (part of an eleven-way tie), and in 1951 for his film Miss Julie (Swedish: Fröken Julie) (an adaptation of August Strindberg's play which tied with Vittorio De Sica's Miracle in Milan).\nDespite his success with those films, Sjöberg was foremost a stage director, perhaps the greatest at Dramaten (alongside first Olof Molander and later Ingmar Bergman). He was a First Director of Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre between 1930 and 1980; he staged there many remarkable and historic productions. Sjöberg was also a pioneer director of drama for early Swedish TV (his 1955 TV production of Hamlet is a national milestone). At the 3rd Guldbagge Awards Sjöberg won the award for Best Director for the film Ön.Sjöberg died in a car accident on his way to rehearsal at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:45:31.688470+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1604, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Sj%C3%B6berg"}], "uuid": "5bee03ed-ee6e-4473-837e-f6c20c6a7ef0", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14945", "external_references": [{"id": 7018, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q374792"}, {"id": 7019, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "47025050"}, {"id": 7020, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79109264"}, {"id": 7021, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79109264"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:28:06.634602+10:00"}

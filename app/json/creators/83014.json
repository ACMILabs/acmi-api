Some of Cayatte's earlier films that addressed his characteristic themes include Justice est faite (Justice is Done; 1950), Nous sommes tous des assassins (We Are All Murderers; 1952), and Le passage du Rhin (Tomorrow Is My Turn; 1960).\nIn 1963, he undertook a bold experiment in film narrative with a set of two films: Jean-Marc ou La vie conjugale (Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Jean-Marc) and Françoise ou La vie conjugale (Anatomy of a Marriage: My Days with Françoise). These two films tell the same story from two different points of view. His 1973 film, Il n'y a pas de fumée sans feu, won the Silver Bear Special Jury Prize at the 23rd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-15T10:24:18.164553+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1630, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Cayatte"}], "uuid": "8bc73512-9cb3-4a38-981c-363a57547389", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31047", "external_references": [{"id": 7124, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q517725"}, {"id": 7125, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "73851103"}, {"id": 7126, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82102988"}, {"id": 7127, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82102988"}], "date_modified": "2024-10-18T22:55:06.865995+11:00"}

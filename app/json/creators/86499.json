Working across on- and offline modes of making, their expanded collage practice weaves together the old and the new to speak to potential futures. Drawing on humour, pop, sex, queer theory, history and iconography, their works are shrines to a post-truth era. They have exhibited extensively locally and internationally with recent projects including experimental live-streamed theatre, interactive media, AR, VR, performance and installation. In 2021, Xanthe developed new commissions for Sydney Opera House, Munch Museum, Bundoora Homestead and UQ Art Museum. In 2022, they worked on major projects for presentation at RISING Festival, The Museum of Contemporary Art, ACMI, The Lismore Regional Gallery and Grafton Regional Gallery. Xanthe is currently undertaking a PhD focusing on digital and interactive art at RMIT University.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T06:38:48.696220+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "25f1f8bd-4922-4f99-a267-6984d62e566a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40369", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T06:38:48.696442+11:00"}

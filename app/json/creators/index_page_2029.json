Appropriating the structures and codes of television and cinema narratives, Silver relies on the viewer's complicity -- the expectation of how media stories are \"read,\" the desire to believe and identify with their conventions and characters.\nBlurring authenticity and falseness, artifice and reality (\"real as compared to what?\" she asks), Silver often merges stylized black-and-white film with color video, fragmented images with written text and sound, elements of documentary and melodrama with comedy. From the elusive Things I Forget to Tell Myself (1988) to the multi-leveled melodrama of The Houses That Are Left (1990), her fragmented narratives are steeped in ironic inquiry. References to broadcast advertising and television formats are informed by Silver's experience as a commercial video editor. Investigating how contemporary identity is both reflected and constructed by television and cinema, Silver questions storytelling, role-playing and the means by which popular narratives articulate fictions of the self.\nIn recent years Silver has lived for extended periods outside of the United States. Her experiences as an \"outside observer\" in Germany, France, and Japan have led to works in which she questions the\nmyths and realities of cultural and national identity. Interweaving modes of documentary, essay, and story-telling in works such as Former East/Former West (1995) and 37 Stories About Leaving Home (1997), Silver explores how we negotiate cultural narratives to arrive at definitions of the self. Silver was born in 1957. She received a B.A. and a B.F.A. from Cornell University, and studied in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Media Bureau, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her works have been exhibited at festivals and institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork; The Kitchen, New York; Torino International Film and Video Festival, Italy; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; Berlin Film Festival; Artists Space, New\n York; The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Halle Sud, Geneva; and Laforet Art Museum, Tokyo.

Willfully primitive, often grotesque, and crafted with an ingenious visual shorthand, his psychodramatic landscapes of image and text are fabricated within the ironic vernacular of pop culture.\n\nOursler has worked in installation, painting, sculpture, and video since the mid-1970s. His recent mixed media installations, in which theatrical objects such as puppets and dolls are layered with video projections and spoken text, are prefigured in the wildly inventive body of videotapes that he has produced over the past twenty years.\n\nIn his videotapes, Oursler's idiosyncratic fictions take the form of bizarre narrative odysseys, horror-comedies that evoke Caligari by way of Eraserhead. Subjective visions of cultural and psychosexual delirium are pursued with outrageous black humor and a surreal theatricality.\n\nThe miniaturized, hand-constructed and painted mixed-media sets that are Oursler's signature suggest post-punk spectacles via German Expressionism; his somnambulant voiceovers and disorienting sound collages evoke stream-of-consciousness dreamstates. To enter one of his insular universes is to embark on a twisted journey that assumes the form and content of a hallucination of the contemporary collective unconscious. Strewn with the objects and idioms of adolescent fantasies, the detritus of mass cultural artifacts, and the macabre inversions of nightmares, Oursler's elaborate theatrical microcosms are populated by jerry-rigged props, hand-made puppets, found objects, body parts and, at times, human actors.\n\nFusing media-saturated artifice with primal obsessions, the iconography of his visual tableaux ranges from the biblical to the perverse; the language of his narrated texts is hilarious, irreverent and unexpectedly poetic. Utilizing low-tech gadgets to simulate and satirize video effects, his disjunctive fictions are haunted by themes of sexual alienation and hysteria, political and cultural violence, and the dichotomies of good and evil, life and death.\n\nEarly works, such as The Weak Bullet (1980) and Grand Mal (1981), have been described as \"half Jackson Pollack, half David Cronenberg, and as funny as [they are] paranoid.\" The faux-naivete of his visual and spoken tales belies the textual sophistication of his meta-language of pop culture and subversion of narrative modes.\n\nIn the late 1980s Oursler increasingly used his narrative and visual strategies to construct social critiques. His more recent installation works continue to explore a kind of macabre psychodramatic theater with pop cultural elements. Fantastic Prayers, a 1999 CD-ROM project that translates many of these themes into an interactive format, is a collaboration of Oursler, writer Constance DeJong and composer/musician Stephen Vitiello.\n\nOursler was born in 1957. He studied at Rockland Community College, Suffern, New York, and received a B.F.A. from the California Institute for the Arts, Valencia, where he studied under John Baldessari.\n\nIn 1999, a mid-career retrospective of Oursler's work will be held at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, and will tour to The Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston and Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. Oursler's videotapes and installations have been widely exhibited internationally, including one-person shows at capc Musee, Musee d'art Contemporain de Bordeaux, France; Kunstverein, Hannover, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE); Metro Pictures, New York; Museum Fur Gegenwartskunst, Basel; and the Museum Folkwang, Essen, West Germany. His work has also been seen in group shows at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels; Documentas IIX and X, Kassel, Germany; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; and DuMont Kunsthalle, Cologne. In addition, he has received commissions from Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and the 1989 Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, New York.\n\nOursler lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nTony Oursler: Selected Works, 1979, 34:20, b&w and color, sound\nDiamond (Head), 1979, 13:52 min, b&w\nGood Things and Bad Things, 1979, 11:51, b&w and color\nLife, 1979, 9:17 min, b&w\nThe Loner, 1980, 29:56 min, color, sound\nThe Weak Bullet, 1980, 12:41 min, color, sound\nGrand Mal, 1981, 22:36 min, color, sound\nSon of Oil, 1982, 16:08 min, color, sound\nSpinout, 1983, 16:02 min, color, sound\nEVOL, 1984, 28:58 min, color, sound\nDiamond: The 8 Lights (Spheres of Influence), 1985, 53:47 min, color, sound\nSucker, 1987, 5:33 min, color,\nJoyride (TM), 1988, 14:23 min, color, sound\nONOUROWN, 1990, 45:40 min, color, sound\nTunic (Song for Karen), 1990, 6:17 min, color, sound\nKepone, 1991, 11:05 min, color, sound\nModel Release, Par-Schizoid-Position, and Test, 1992, 12 min, color, sound\nModel Release, 1992, 3:24 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Constance DeJong.\nPar-Schizoid-Position, 1992, 2:53 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Kim Gordon\nTest, 1992, 5:23 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Karen Finley\nToxic Detox, 1992, 32 min, color, sound\nFantastic Prayers, 1999, CD-ROM, ,\nOff, 1999, 60 min., color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:16:40.896743+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "034579b9-7fcf-4c2e-a039-6f0690feb7f2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110052", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6399, "name": "Jon McCormack", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2294361, "title": "Turbulence [excerpts]", "work_id": 109881, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2269270, "title": "Turbulence 2 (Revised version commissioned by ACMI)", "work_id": 107951, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1340712, "title": "ENS", "work_id": 109663, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1340711, "title": "Universal zoologies", "work_id": 109662, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Jon McCormack is one of Australia's top computer animation artists.

"date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "In her rich exploration of light and landscape as agents of visual perception and memory, both personal and mythic, Mary Lucier re-examines 19th-century art historical and literary traditions through the lens of contemporary technology. Lucier is well known for her contributions to the form of multi-monitor, multi-channel video installation. In her elegant 'pictorial-narrative' works, in which video images are set within configurations that she describes as 'at once cinematic, sculptural, and theatrical', light and landscape are the essential modes of representation and metaphor.\n\nReinvestigating the American pastoral myth in what she terms 'an ironic dialogue between past and present, mundane and poetic, real and ideal', Lucier questions collective memory and identity through an art historical vocabulary. Echoing paradigmatic motifs of 19th-century painting traditions, her metaphoric use of light to signify transcendence and her allusions to the sublime evoke Romantic and Modernist ideals. Ohio at Giverny (1983) is a poetic homage to Monet's Impressionism; Wilderness (1986) refers to the Luminists and the Hudson River School. In Lucier's works, nature is transformed by culture and technology; luminosity is synonymous with lyricism.\n\nLucier began working in video in the 1970s, after first exploring sculpture, performance and photography. Early works, such as Dawn Burn (1975) and Bird's Eye (1978), are empirical records of the optical effects of light on the camera's eye. Aiming a laser directly at the camera or pointing a lens at the sun, she burned the vidicon tube in real time, inscribing it with calligraphic abstractions of light. In addition to installations, she has also produced video dance works with choreographer Elizabeth Streb, exploring relationships of the human figure, sculptural movement, and landscape.\n\nLucier was born in 1944. She received a B.A. from Brandeis University. Among her many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship and an American Film Institute Independent Filmmaker Grant, as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. She has been artist-in-residence at the Capp Street Project, San Francisco, and the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York; and has taught at New York University, the San Francisco Art Institute, the Cleveland Institute of Art, Minnesota College of Art and Design, and the School of Visual Arts, New York. Lucier has had solo exhibitions at The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; Capp Street Project, San Francisco; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Dallas Museum of Art; Madison Art Center, Wisconsin, and Greenburg-Wilson Gallery.

Capturing the essence of subjects that range from avant-garde artists to New England fishermen, her video portraits are minimalist dramas -- precisely composed, richly nuanced, and highly expressive of the character of the \"sitter.\"\n\nIn 1980, Logue began the 30 Second Spots, an innovative series of video portraits that she terms \"commercials for artists.\" These succinct \"spots\" use the format, style, and condensed timeframe of television advertising to present unconventional portraits of vanguard artists, musicians, writers, and performers. Each subject performs a concise gesture or action in close-up before a stationary camera; Logue heightens this intimate theater with a precise application of electronic effects.\n\nProducing portraits in cities around the world, she has collaborated with such well-known figures as Laurie Anderson, David Hockney, Philip Glass, and Jacques Derrida. Logue's first video portraits, begun in 1972, were silent, extended examinations of the faces of friends, family, and neighbors. Eloquently reinterpreting the photographic portrait for a time-based medium, Logue's video project extends her earlier work as a portrait and still photographer.\n\nLogue was born in 1942. She trained as a painter and photographer, receiving a B.F.A. and an M.A. from St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. Logue, who was one of the founders of the video program at the American Film Institute, has also taught at California Institute of the Arts, UCLA, and Otis/Parsons. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the French Ministry of Culture, the Massachusetts Council on the Arts and Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her works have been widely broadcast and exhibited at institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; International Center of Photography, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Videonale Bonn; and Second Bank of the United States (Portrait Gallery), Philadelphia. She lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nVideo Portraits: Silent Words for Installation, 1973-83, 19:49 min, color, silent\n30 Second Spots: New York, 1982, 14:45 min, color, sound\n30 Second Spots: Paris, 1982-83, 12:21 min, color, sound\n30 Second Spots: San Francisco, 1984, 2:54 min, color, sound\nRene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After The War, 1984, 3:42 min, color, sound\nPortraits: New England Fishermen, 1985, 14:55 min, color, sound\nVideo Portraits: French Writers, 1986, 7:46 min, color, sound\nA Portrait of a Friend by Friends: Emmett Williams, 1988, 23 min, color, sound\n5 Composers: 5 Countries, 1989, 40 min, color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T15:45:05.084466+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "0e96eadc-e3e0-4f21-89cf-eb04bb6ed508", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110045", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6385, "name": "George Kuchar", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2141027, "title": "Color me lurid: the weird world of George Kuchar", "work_id": 82489, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039097, "title": "Weather diary #5", "work_id": 107944, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039098, "title": "Rainy season", "work_id": 107945, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T13:37:44.404968+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "38155de3-d5f7-4451-9365-f8055b6712ed", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110044", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}, {"id": 6384, "name": "D1 facilities of the CICV Centre Pierre Shaeffer,Montbeliard/Belfort, France", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2296858, "title": "Shanghaied text", "work_id": 107943, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T18:29:09.457197+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "03dee862-02c5-4b4c-9de5-30ece0d44506", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110522", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}]}

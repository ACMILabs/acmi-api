His films are characterised by nonlinear narratives, atmospheric music, and vivid cinematography involving bold, saturated colours. A pivotal figure of Hong Kong cinema, Wong is considered a contemporary auteur, and ranks third on Sight & Sound's 2002 poll of the greatest filmmakers of the previous 25 years. His films frequently appear on best-of lists domestically and internationally.\nBorn in Shanghai, Wong emigrated to British Hong Kong as a child with his family. He began a career as a screenwriter for soap operas before transitioning to directing with his debut, the crime drama As Tears Go By (1988). While As Tears Go By was fairly successful in Hong Kong, Wong moved away from the contemporary trend of crime and action movies to embark on more personal filmmaking styles. Days of Being Wild (1990), his first venture in such a direction, did not perform well at the box office. It however received critical acclaim, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1991 Hong Kong Film Awards. His next film, Ashes of Time (1994), met with a mixed reception because of its vague plot and atypical take on the wuxia genre.\nExhausted by the time-consuming filming and post-production of Ashes of Time, Wong directed Chungking Express (1994), a smaller film that he hoped would rekindle his love of cinema. The film, expressing a more lighthearted atmosphere, catapulted Wong to international prominence, and won Best Film and Best Director at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards. Wong followed up with the crime thriller Fallen Angels in 1995. Although it was initially tepidly received by critics, Fallen Angels has since come to be considered a cult classic of the Golden Age of Hong Kong cinema, being especially representative of Wong's style. Wong would go on to consolidate his worldwide reputation with the 1997 drama Happy Together, for which he won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival.\nThe 2000 drama In the Mood for Love, revered for its lush visuals and subtle storytelling, concretely established Wong's trademark filmmaking styles. Among his other work are 2046 (2004) and The Grandmaster (2013), both of which received awards and nominations worldwide.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T02:20:09.141687+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6256, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Kar-wai"}], "uuid": "4df65813-be32-4a12-a02a-e9178cf8f152", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4030", "external_references": [{"id": 34866, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55431"}, {"id": 56088, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "3406477"}, {"id": 56089, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n98022936"}, {"id": 56090, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n98022936"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:20:15.198380+10:00"}

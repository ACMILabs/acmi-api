In one work, for example, she used phase-shift oscillators in order to synthesise sounds from controlled feedback. Electricity generated by a solar panel is fed into drawings (made up of pencil marks, silver and paper) that conduct, impede or collect electricity. A transistor and speaker attached to the drawing is wired for sound. In Aeritus (1998), a magnetic turbulence around ordinary objects (a fork, a knife and a chair) allows for a map of electronic flows through harmonic phase disturbance. Siphon (1997) stored electricity inside insulated jars. With these she created room-sized electronic circuits, with speaker magnets and voice coils emitting hums of electrons crashing into atoms. Her work has been shown in Australian Perspecta 1991 and the Biennale of Sydney 1992. Together, Haines and Hinterding have produced Edges, Cape Bruny Lightstation, Tasmania, 1999 and The Levitation Grounds, Artspace Sydney, 2000.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:27:49.606928+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "bc1f5835-bc79-4d56-b654-d3774291a827", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110109", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:27:49.607277+11:00"}

Writes Lucas: \"As a woman, I am creating a discourse within which to elucidate my relationship toward the electronic dream. I unravel the complexity of this relationship by setting up virtual interactions with mediated devices, such as automated tellers, public access television, computer games, and the World Wide Web.\"\n\nLucas uses her camera as a diaristic device, into which she unloads her anecdotal, performative mini-dramas. Her work resonates with a sense of social isolation and alienation from the computer/television/electronic media that she posits as a surrogate for personal interaction. The backdrop to Lucas' work is the empty world of day-time television, cable shopping channels and shopping malls.\n\nKristin Lucas was born in 1968. She received a B.F.A. from The Cooper Union, New York. Lucas' work has been screened at Artists Space, New York, and at festivals in Mexico City, Montreal, New York and San Francisco. Her work was included in the 1997 Biennial Exhibition of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and in exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York; The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri; steirischer herbst 9, Graz, Austria; the 7e Semaine Internationale de Video, Geneva, Switzerland; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; and at Dunedin Public Gallery, New Zealand.

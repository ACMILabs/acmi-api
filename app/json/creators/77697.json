She began her professional acting career with the company of the actor-manager Ben Greet, with whom she toured the US from 1904 to 1908. In Britain she played in old and new plays on tour and in the West End, often appearing with her husband, the actor and director Lewis Casson. She joined the Old Vic company during the First World War, and in the early 1920s Bernard Shaw, impressed by seeing her in a tragedy, wrote Saint Joan with her in mind. She starred in it with great success. She became known as Britain's leading tragedienne, but also appeared frequently in comedy.\nDuring the Second World War, Thorndike and her husband toured in Shakespeare productions, taking professional theatre to remote rural locations for the first time. Towards the end of the war she joined Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier for two seasons staged by the Old Vic company in the West End. After the war she and Casson made many overseas tours, playing in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. They also appeared on Broadway.\nThorndike was mainly known as a stage actress, but made several films from the 1920s to the 1960s, among them The Prince and the Showgirl (1957) and Uncle Vanya (1963), both with Olivier. She also broadcast from time to time on radio and television. Her last stage appearances were in 1969 at the theatre named in her honour, the Thorndike Theatre, Leatherhead.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:38:25.289022+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6203, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_Thorndike"}], "uuid": "7db02a08-fa86-411a-b745-2bd2311d80cf", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38227", "external_references": [{"id": 51653, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q177248"}, {"id": 55906, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "64097827"}, {"id": 55907, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85025639"}, {"id": 55908, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85025639"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T01:45:12.953100+11:00"}

Showtime's programming includes theatrically released motion pictures , original television series; boxing and mixed martial arts matches; occasional stand-up comedy specials, and made-for-TV movies.\nHeadquartered at Paramount Plaza which is in the northern part of New York City's Broadway district, Showtime operates eight 24-hour, linear multiplex channels; a traditional subscription video on demand service, and two proprietary streaming platforms (the TV Everywhere offering Showtime Anytime which is included as part of a subscription to the linear Showtime television service and a namesake over-the-top service) sold directly to streaming-only consumers. In addition, the Showtime brand has been licensed for use by a number of channels and platforms worldwide including Showtime Arabia (it has been merged into OSN) in the Middle East and North Africa, and the now-defunct Showtime Movie Channels in Australia.\nShowtime is also sold independently of the traditional and over-the-top multichannel video programming distributors a la carte through Apple TV Channels and Amazon Channels which feature VOD library content and live feeds of Showtime's linear television services (consisting of the primary channel's East and West Coast feeds; for Amazon Video customers the East Coast feeds show its seven multiplex channels). As of September 2018, Showtime's programming was available to approximately 28.567 million U.S. households which subscribed to a multichannel television provider (28.318 million of which receive Showtime's primary channel at a minimum).On January 30, 2023, Paramount announced plans to fully integrate the Showtime direct-to-consumer service with the premium tier of the Paramount+ streaming service; the combined service will be branded as Paramount+ with Showtime, replacing a streaming bundle of the same name that launched in mid-2022. The merger was on June 27, 2023. The standalone Showtime and cable-specific Showtime Anytime apps will be shut down by the end of 2023.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:17:02.771747+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6180, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)"}], "uuid": "ccc9b185-2905-41ff-9d84-a808650d904b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12554", "external_references": [{"id": 32827, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q118448572"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T15:35:33.157239+11:00"}

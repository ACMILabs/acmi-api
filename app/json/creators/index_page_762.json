The popular and acclaimed All the President's Men (1976) was a landmark film for Redford.\nIn the 1980s, Redford began his career as a director with Ordinary People (1980), which was one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Academy Awards including Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Director for Redford.

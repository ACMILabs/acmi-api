Appropriating the structures and codes of television and cinema narratives, Silver relies on the viewer's complicity -- the expectation of how media stories are \"read,\" the desire to believe and identify with their conventions and characters.\nBlurring authenticity and falseness, artifice and reality (\"real as compared to what?\" she asks), Silver often merges stylized black-and-white film with color video, fragmented images with written text and sound, elements of documentary and melodrama with comedy. From the elusive Things I Forget to Tell Myself (1988) to the multi-leveled melodrama of The Houses That Are Left (1990), her fragmented narratives are steeped in ironic inquiry. References to broadcast advertising and television formats are informed by Silver's experience as a commercial video editor. Investigating how contemporary identity is both reflected and constructed by television and cinema, Silver questions storytelling, role-playing and the means by which popular narratives articulate fictions of the self.\nIn recent years Silver has lived for extended periods outside of the United States. Her experiences as an \"outside observer\" in Germany, France, and Japan have led to works in which she questions the\nmyths and realities of cultural and national identity. Interweaving modes of documentary, essay, and story-telling in works such as Former East/Former West (1995) and 37 Stories About Leaving Home (1997), Silver explores how we negotiate cultural narratives to arrive at definitions of the self. Silver was born in 1957. She received a B.A. and a B.F.A. from Cornell University, and studied in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Media Bureau, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her works have been exhibited at festivals and institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork; The Kitchen, New York; Torino International Film and Video Festival, Italy; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; World Wide Video Festival, The Hague; Berlin Film Festival; Artists Space, New\n York; The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; Halle Sud, Geneva; and Laforet Art Museum, Tokyo.

Intensely personal and often violently charged, these phenomenological exercises are characterized by a visceral enactment of physical and psychological catharses. Performing in isolation with a hand-held, moving camera, Palestine taps the body as a conduit for the self. The very titles of his pieces -- Internal Tantrum (1975), Running Outburst (1975) -- suggest literal and metaphorical catalysts for release or escape from confinement.\n\nMovement and sound, as they relate to the body and the voice, are the vehicles through which Palestine expels internal energy. Ritualistic vocal expressions -- hypnotic chants, trance-inducing tones -- become physical translations of anguish and pain, as does the use of the video as an extension of the body. Running frenetically with the camera or strapping it to a moving motorcycle, Palestine uses motion as metaphor. Challenging identity and perception, he positions the viewer behind the camera, in a subjective point of view. Seeing through his eyes, moving with his body, the viewer is both participant and voyeur.\n\nIn his work in performance, music, video and related media since the late 1960s, Palestine uses certain emblematic objects, including teddy bears and scarves, as signatures -- what he terms 'symbols of identification.'\n\nPalestine was born in 1945. He studied at New York University, Columbia University, Mannes College of Music and California Institute of the Arts. He has received grants from the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts, among other organizations. His work has been exhibited internationally, at festivals and institutions including the Venice Biennale, Italy; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; Kunsthalle, Basel, Switzerland; Long Beach Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art, Houston; and Centre d'Art Contemporain, Geneva.

Both as a performer of new music and an organizer of exhibitions, she became one of the iconic figures of the period. In 1963 Moorman established the annual New York Avant Garde Festival, which she ran until 1982. It was at the second of these, in 1964, that she met and first collaborated with Nam June Paik, and their partnership was to last until Moorman's death in 1991. Paik created some of his best-known pieces for her, including TV Bra for Living Sculpture (1969) and TV-Cello (1971), and she was featured in many of his classic performances and videotapes, including Global Groove (1973).\n\nMainstream notoriety came to Moorman in 1967, when she was convicted on a charge of indecent exposure during a performance of Paik's Opera Sextronique. Ironically, this controversy led to Moorman becoming a guest on TV talk shows, giving her a place in the public's consciousness as the \"Topless Cellist.\" Though her performances were marked by a playful delight in the absurd, this was framed at all times by a high seriousness in her approach to her music. No matter what the circumstances, she would play in the appropriate concert gown, even when hanging from a trapeze or suspended by balloons.\n\nCharlotte Moorman was born in 1933 in Little Rock, Arkansas, and died in 1991. She studied classical cello at Julliard and was for several years a member of American Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. In addition to her work with Paik, during her career Moorman collaborated with or performed works for Joseph Beuys, Jim McWilliams, Otto Piene, John Cage, and Yoko Ono.\n\nReferences:\nStockhausen's Originale: Doubletakes, 1964-94, 30:35 min, b&w, sound\n26?1.1499\" For String Player, 1973, 42 min, color, sound\nGlobal Groove, 1973, 28:30 min, color, sound\nThe Chocolate Cello, 1973, 30 min, b&w, sound\nDocumenta 6 Satellite Telecast, 1977, 30 min, color, sound\nGuadalcanal Requiem, 1977, re-edited 1979, 28:33 min, color, sound\nThe Misfits - 30 Years of Fluxus, 1993, 80, color, sound\n\"Topless Cellist\" Charlotte Moorman, 1995, 30 min, color, sound\nArt is Easy, 1997, 23:25 min, color, sound\nCharlotte Resounding, 1998, 40 min, color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-26T22:42:20.294705+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b33b5bf8-56e2-453b-9b97-55c9ff122d22", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110054", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-26T22:42:20.294942+11:00"}, {"id": 6405, "name": "Nam Paik", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2619649, "title": "Videa 'n' videology 1959-1973", "work_id": 109345, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618072, "title": "Global groove", "work_id": 107954, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Nam June Paik is a major contemporary artist and a seminal figure in video art. His video sculptures, installations, performances and tapes encompass one of the most influential and significant bodies of work in the medium.\n\nFrom his Fluxus-based performances and altered television sets of the early 1960s, to his ground-breaking videotapes and multi-media installations of the 1970s, 80s and 90s, Paik has made an enormous contribution to the history and development of video as an art form. Exercising radical art-making strategies with irreverent humor, he deconstructs and demystifies the language, content and technology of television. Merging global communications theories with an antic Pop sensibility, his iconoclastic works explore the juncture of art and popular culture.\n\nIn the 1970s, Paik began a series of tapes, including Global Groove (1973), that were extraordinarily influential and innovative. Applying surreal conceptual wit and \"neo-Dada\" irony, he established a radical syntax of video based on the visual and aural grammar of television, appropriating and then derailing its very language. Densely layered with witty intertextual references and transcultural content, his exuberant, disjunctive collages function as a stream-of-consciousness flow of images, music and electronic effects.\n\nAs if switching television channels around the world, Paik engages in kinetic cultural explorations as a form of global communications. In vibrantly textured audio and visual pastiches, his emblematic motifs of Pop iconography, international avant-garde figures, multicultural performances and media appropriations are subjected to a disruptive barrage of exquisite electronic techniques -- hyperbolic fragmentations, alterations and juxtapositions.\n\nPaik's early works display the signature image manipulations and colorizations of the Paik/Abe Synthesizer, a device he developed in 1969 with electronics engineer Shuya Abe, which helped to revolutionize the technological grammar of the medium. The richly layered and textured alterations of his later works exhibit the tour-de-force imaging techniques of longtime collaborator Paul Garrin. Images multiply and divide within the frame; temporal and spatial shifts proliferate, visuals and sound are juxtaposed in ironic contexts.\n\nPaik's tapes often take the form of collaborations with or tributes to the avant-garde artists who were his friends and colleagues, including John Cage (A Tribute to John Cage, 1973), Merce Cunningham (Merce by Merce by Paik, 1978), Allen Ginsberg and Allan Kaprow (Allan 'n Allen's Complaint, 1982), Julien Beck and Judith Malina (Living with the Living Theatre, 1989) and Joseph Beuys MAJORCA-fantasia, 1989).\n\nPaik began working in music and performance while a student in Germany, where he participated in the international Fluxus movement. His European Fluxus performances, actions and events included \"prepared\" pianos and musical instruments, and later, altered television sets. In Germany, Paik collaborated with such artists as Wolf Vostell and Joseph Beuys, and met avant-garde composer John Cage, whose ideas and art had a tremendous influence on his work. In 1964, Paik came to New York, where his \"discovery\" of the Sony Portapak and video art has become one of video's most enduring, if apocryphal, legends. (According to this tale, Paik bought one of the first Sony Portapaks to be manufactured for the consumer market. He made his first tape the same day, recording Pope Paul VI's visit to New York from a cab window; the tape was then exhibited at the Cafe a Go Go.)\n\nIn New York, Paik began a longtime collaboration with avant-garde cellist Charlotte Moorman, with whom he produced a series of important performance-based works. Among their most notorious pieces are the Opera Sextronique (1967), the TV Bra for Living Sculpture (1969), and TV Cello (1971). Paik is perhaps most widely recognized for his prodigious body of video installations and sculptures, from the landmark works of the 1970s, including TV Buddha (1974), TV Garden (1974-78), and Fish Flies on Sky (1975), to the 1986 Family of Robot and the 1995 Megatron.\n\nPaik's experiments with satellite technology began in 1977 at Documenta 6 in Kassel, Germany, where he collaborated on a live telecast with Joseph Beuys and Douglas Davis. His \"live\" international satellite broadcasts of the 1980s, including Good Morning Mr. Orwell (1984), Bye Bye Kipling (1986), and Wrap Around the World (1988), are global video installations that conjoin disparate spatial, contextual and temporal elements.\n\nLinking the artworld and the media, pop culture and the avant-garde, technology and philosophy, Paik's works resonate with an irreverent humor and subversive brilliance that have influenced contemporary art, video and television.\n\nPaik was born in 1932. He studied music and art history at the University of Tokyo, producing a thesis on Arnold Schoenberg, and graduated in 1956 with a degree in aesthetics. Paik's studies continued in Germany at the Universities of Munich and Cologne, and the Conservatory of Music in Freiburg. From 1958-63, Paik worked with Karlheinz Stockhausen at the WDR Studio fur elektronsiche Musik in Cologne. After meeting Fluxus founder George Maciunas in 1961, he participated in numerous European Fluxus performances, actions and events.\n\nPaik's first one-man exhibition was the 1963 Exposition of Electronic Music - Electronic Television at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany. Paik came to New York in 1964; his first one-person exhibition in New York was at the Bonino Gallery in 1966. In 1969, Paik participated in the landmark exhibition TV as a Creative Medium at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York. Also in 1969, Paik and electronics engineer Shuya Abe created the Paik/Abe Synthesizer at the New Television Workshop at WGBH in Boston. Many of his tapes were produced in the 1970s while he was artist-in-residence at the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen in New York. Since 1979, he has taught at Staatlichen Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf, Germany.\n\nPaik is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Rockefeller Foundation grant, the American Film Institute's Maya Deren Award for Independent Film and Video, The New York State Governor's Art Award, and The New York City Mayor's Award to Distinguished Immigrants. In 1998 he was honored with the Kyoto Award in Japan. His works have been the subject of numerous exhibitions, including his first United States retrospective at the Everson Museum, Syracuse, in 1974, and a 1976 retrospective at the Kolnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. In 1982, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York honored him with a comprehensive retrospective of videotapes, video sculptures, installations and performances. In recent years, his installations have been widely exhibited internationally in one-man shows at institutions including Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; and Holly Solomon Gallery, New York, among many others. His work has also been seen in group shows at festivals and institutions including the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial, New York; Documentas 6 and 8, Kassel, Germany; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Video Sculpture, DuMont Kunsthalle, Cologne. In 1988 he was the subject of a retrospective at the Hayward Gallery in London. His live, international satellite extravaganzas have been broadcast around the world. In the year 2000 Paik will be the subject of a major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum.\n\nPaik lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nVideo Synthesizer and \"TV Cello\" Collectibles, 1965-71, 23:25 min, color, silent\nEarly Color TV Manipulations by Nam June Paik, 1965-68, 5:18 min, color.\nVideo Commune, 8:36 min, color.\nTV Cello Premiere, 1971, 7:25 min, color.\nVideo-Film Concert, 1966-72, 1992, 34:50 min, b&w and color, sound\nVideo Tape Study No. 3, 1967-69, 4 min, b&w.

Willfully primitive, often grotesque, and crafted with an ingenious visual shorthand, his psychodramatic landscapes of image and text are fabricated within the ironic vernacular of pop culture.\n\nOursler has worked in installation, painting, sculpture, and video since the mid-1970s. His recent mixed media installations, in which theatrical objects such as puppets and dolls are layered with video projections and spoken text, are prefigured in the wildly inventive body of videotapes that he has produced over the past twenty years.\n\nIn his videotapes, Oursler's idiosyncratic fictions take the form of bizarre narrative odysseys, horror-comedies that evoke Caligari by way of Eraserhead. Subjective visions of cultural and psychosexual delirium are pursued with outrageous black humor and a surreal theatricality.\n\nThe miniaturized, hand-constructed and painted mixed-media sets that are Oursler's signature suggest post-punk spectacles via German Expressionism; his somnambulant voiceovers and disorienting sound collages evoke stream-of-consciousness dreamstates. To enter one of his insular universes is to embark on a twisted journey that assumes the form and content of a hallucination of the contemporary collective unconscious. Strewn with the objects and idioms of adolescent fantasies, the detritus of mass cultural artifacts, and the macabre inversions of nightmares, Oursler's elaborate theatrical microcosms are populated by jerry-rigged props, hand-made puppets, found objects, body parts and, at times, human actors.\n\nFusing media-saturated artifice with primal obsessions, the iconography of his visual tableaux ranges from the biblical to the perverse; the language of his narrated texts is hilarious, irreverent and unexpectedly poetic. Utilizing low-tech gadgets to simulate and satirize video effects, his disjunctive fictions are haunted by themes of sexual alienation and hysteria, political and cultural violence, and the dichotomies of good and evil, life and death.\n\nEarly works, such as The Weak Bullet (1980) and Grand Mal (1981), have been described as \"half Jackson Pollack, half David Cronenberg, and as funny as [they are] paranoid.\" The faux-naivete of his visual and spoken tales belies the textual sophistication of his meta-language of pop culture and subversion of narrative modes.\n\nIn the late 1980s Oursler increasingly used his narrative and visual strategies to construct social critiques. His more recent installation works continue to explore a kind of macabre psychodramatic theater with pop cultural elements. Fantastic Prayers, a 1999 CD-ROM project that translates many of these themes into an interactive format, is a collaboration of Oursler, writer Constance DeJong and composer/musician Stephen Vitiello.\n\nOursler was born in 1957. He studied at Rockland Community College, Suffern, New York, and received a B.F.A. from the California Institute for the Arts, Valencia, where he studied under John Baldessari.\n\nIn 1999, a mid-career retrospective of Oursler's work will be held at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, and will tour to The Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston and Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. Oursler's videotapes and installations have been widely exhibited internationally, including one-person shows at capc Musee, Musee d'art Contemporain de Bordeaux, France; Kunstverein, Hannover, Germany; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE); Metro Pictures, New York; Museum Fur Gegenwartskunst, Basel; and the Museum Folkwang, Essen, West Germany. His work has also been seen in group shows at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels; Documentas IIX and X, Kassel, Germany; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial, New York; the Tate Gallery, London; and DuMont Kunsthalle, Cologne. In addition, he has received commissions from Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and the 1989 Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, New York.\n\nOursler lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nTony Oursler: Selected Works, 1979, 34:20, b&w and color, sound\nDiamond (Head), 1979, 13:52 min, b&w\nGood Things and Bad Things, 1979, 11:51, b&w and color\nLife, 1979, 9:17 min, b&w\nThe Loner, 1980, 29:56 min, color, sound\nThe Weak Bullet, 1980, 12:41 min, color, sound\nGrand Mal, 1981, 22:36 min, color, sound\nSon of Oil, 1982, 16:08 min, color, sound\nSpinout, 1983, 16:02 min, color, sound\nEVOL, 1984, 28:58 min, color, sound\nDiamond: The 8 Lights (Spheres of Influence), 1985, 53:47 min, color, sound\nSucker, 1987, 5:33 min, color,\nJoyride (TM), 1988, 14:23 min, color, sound\nONOUROWN, 1990, 45:40 min, color, sound\nTunic (Song for Karen), 1990, 6:17 min, color, sound\nKepone, 1991, 11:05 min, color, sound\nModel Release, Par-Schizoid-Position, and Test, 1992, 12 min, color, sound\nModel Release, 1992, 3:24 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Constance DeJong.\nPar-Schizoid-Position, 1992, 2:53 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Kim Gordon\nTest, 1992, 5:23 min, color.\nIn collaboration with Karen Finley\nToxic Detox, 1992, 32 min, color, sound\nFantastic Prayers, 1999, CD-ROM, ,\nOff, 1999, 60 min., color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:21:43.139495+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "034579b9-7fcf-4c2e-a039-6f0690feb7f2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110052", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:21:43.139750+11:00"}, {"id": 6403, "name": "Antonio Muntadas", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2709841, "title": "Muntadas: an archive", "work_id": 108206, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618066, "title": "Media Ecology ads", "work_id": 107952, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "A multimedia artist who worked in painting and sculpture in his native\nCatalonia before moving to New York in 1971, Muntadas has produced an\nimportant body of installations, public art projects and videotapes.\nDeconstructing the systems of representation and information that pervade the contemporary \"medialandscape,\" Muntadas posits a compelling discourse on the \"invisible mechanisms\" that inform the production and reception of mass media texts. Reading \"between the lines\" to decode the subjective and objective meanings and\ninterpretations of media language and images, Muntadas\nanalyzes the consumption of information and the process by\nwhich it is mediated and manipulated for power, propaganda,\nand profit. Strategies of fragmentation, decomposition, isolation, reframing, and disintegration of words and images are integral to his inquiry into how facts and information are mediated or contextualized for the viewer/reader. Deconstructing the form of what he terms the \"ecology\" of the media -- cinema and television credits, advertising slogans, the editing of a news story -- he deciphers how its ideological content functions in relation to economic, social and political systems. Works such as Video is\nTelevision? (1989) present dynamic collusions of television, cinema, film and video as cultural\nsignifiers.\n\nCritiquing the incursion of marketing and advertising strategies into politics, art and culture, his works\noften make reflexive use of mass media formats and contexts, including the World Wide Web,\nbillboards and public sites.\n\nMuntadas was born in 1942 in Barcelona, Spain.

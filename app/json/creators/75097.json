Joining the Old Vic Company after World War II, he achieved widespread critical success in Britain for both stage and screen performances. One of British cinema's most celebrated leading men of the time, Finch won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role five times, and won a posthumous Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of crazed television anchorman Howard Beale in the 1976 film Network.\nAccording to the British Film Institute, \"it is arguable that no other actor ever chalked up such a rewarding CV in British films, and he accumulated the awards to bolster this view\". He died only two months before the 49th Academy Awards, making him the first person to win a posthumous Oscar in an acting category. As of 2023, the only other person to have done so was fellow Australian Heath Ledger.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-15T12:06:07.983955+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4875, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Finch"}], "uuid": "07bfef85-75e8-446c-bf68-21cf91913811", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33301", "external_references": [{"id": 25323, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q294454"}, {"id": 30773, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "100242622"}, {"id": 30774, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n80037893"}, {"id": 30775, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n80037893"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-13T00:50:52.686904+11:00"}

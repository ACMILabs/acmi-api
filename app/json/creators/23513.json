Among his credits were Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), The Manchurian Candidate (1962), Seven Days in May (1964), The Train (1964), Seconds (1966), Grand Prix (1966), French Connection II (1975), Black Sunday (1977), The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), Ronin (1998) and Reindeer Games (2000).\nHe won four Emmy Awards—three consecutive—in the 1990s for directing the television movies Against the Wall, The Burning Season, Andersonville, and George Wallace, the last of which also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\nFrankenheimer's 30 feature films and over 50 plays for television were notable for their influence on contemporary thought. He became a pioneer of the \"modern-day political thriller\", having begun his career at the height of the Cold War.He was technically highly accomplished from his days in live television; many of his films were noted for creating \"psychological dilemmas\" for his male protagonists along with having a strong \"sense of environment,\" similar in style to films by director Sidney Lumet, for whom he had earlier worked as assistant director. He developed a \"tremendous propensity for exploring political situations\" which would ensnare his characters.Movie critic Leonard Maltin writes that \"in his time [1960s]... Frankenheimer worked with the top writers, producers and actors in a series of films that dealt with issues that were just on top of the moment—things that were facing us all.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:01:34.825836+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2419, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer"}], "uuid": "7a078520-e74c-47da-8d45-e55015561254", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22264", "external_references": [{"id": 10352, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q262820"}, {"id": 10353, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117354"}, {"id": 10354, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86143617"}, {"id": 10355, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86143617"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-17T10:45:26.616305+11:00"}

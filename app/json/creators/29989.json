His low-budget genre films, known for their distinctive visual flair and stylish technical ingenuity, feature recurring themes and imagery concerning the conflict between illusion and reality, as well as the destructive capacity of human nature. He was a pioneer of Italian genre cinema, and is regarded as one of the most influential auteurs of the horror film genre.After providing special effects work and other assistance on productions like Hercules (1958) and Caltiki – The Immortal Monster (1959), Bava made his official feature directorial debut with the horror film Black Sunday, released in 1960. He went on to direct such films as The Girl Who Knew Too Much, Black Sabbath, The Whip and the Body (all released in 1963), Blood and Black Lace (1964), Planet of the Vampires (1965), Kill, Baby, Kill (1966), Danger: Diabolik (1968), A Bay of Blood (1971), Baron Blood (1972), Lisa and the Devil (1974) and Rabid Dogs (1974).\nAccording to the British Film Institute, \"Bava took a vital role in the creation of the modern horror film. If there was to be a Mount Rushmore-style monument dedicated to four directors whose work pioneered a new form of big screen chills and thrills, those giant faces etched in granite on the mountainside would be: Bava, Alfred Hitchcock, Georges Franju and Michael Powell.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:04:29.968188+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4613, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bava"}], "uuid": "03a1562a-b244-4f91-aa57-7c85d0db86c6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24430", "external_references": [{"id": 25185, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55438"}, {"id": 30113, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "311024422"}, {"id": 30114, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n84079480"}, {"id": 30115, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n84079480"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T11:46:37.679104+10:00"}

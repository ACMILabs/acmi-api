He was trained in London at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and first appeared professionally on the stage in 1926. In 1927, he was cast in a play with his future wife Elsa Lanchester, with whom he lived and worked until his death.\nHe played a wide range of classical and modern roles, making an impact in Shakespeare at the Old Vic. His film career took him to Broadway and then Hollywood, but he also collaborated with Alexander Korda on notable British films of the era, including The Private Life of Henry VIII, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the title character. He portrayed everything from monsters and misfits to kings. Among Laughton's biggest film hits were The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Mutiny on the Bounty, Ruggles of Red Gap, Jamaica Inn, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Big Clock, and Witness for the Prosecution. Daniel Day-Lewis cited Laughton as one of his inspirations, saying: \"He was probably the greatest film actor who came from that period of time. He had something quite remarkable. His generosity as an actor; he fed himself into that work. As an actor, you cannot take your eyes off him.\"In his later career, he took up stage directing, notably in The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial, and George Bernard Shaw's Don Juan in Hell, in which he also starred. He directed one film, the thriller The Night of the Hunter, which after an initially disappointing reception is acclaimed today as a film classic.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:23:25.739884+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3740, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Laughton"}], "uuid": "aebede4f-e5aa-48b9-b650-cfcfd2834b5b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16695", "external_references": [{"id": 25629, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55264"}, {"id": 27764, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "32104205"}, {"id": 27765, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50058537"}, {"id": 27766, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50058537"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:23:28.656363+10:00"}, {"id": 77576, "name": "Tony Curtis", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2307324, "title": "Spartacus", "work_id": 84158, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Bernard Schwartz", "date_of_birth": "1925-06-03", "date_of_death": "2010-09-29", "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Tony Curtis (born Bernard Schwartz; June 3, 1925 – September 29, 2010) was an American actor whose career spanned six decades, achieving the height of his popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. He acted in more than 100 films, in roles covering a wide range of genres. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.\nHe achieved his first major recognition as a dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for The Defiant Ones (1958) alongside Sidney Poitier (who was also nominated in the same category). This was followed by the comedies Some Like It Hot and Operation Petticoat in 1959. In 1960, Curtis played a supporting role in the epic historical drama Spartacus.\nHis stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960. His most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama The Boston Strangler. Curtis also took on the role of the Ukrainian Cossack Andrei in the historical action romance epic Taras Bulba in 1962 and starred in the ITC TV series The Persuaders!, with Curtis playing American millionaire Danny Wilde.

Niven was known as a handsome and debonair leading man in Classic Hollywood films. He received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.\nBorn in London, Niven attended Heatherdown Preparatory School and Stowe School before gaining a place at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. Upon developing an interest in acting, he found a role as an extra in the British film There Goes the Bride (1932). Bored with the peacetime army, he resigned his commission in 1933, relocated to New York, then travelled to Hollywood. There, he hired an agent and had several small parts in films through 1935, including a non-speaking role in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Mutiny on the Bounty (1935). This helped him gain a contract with Samuel Goldwyn.\nParts, initially small, in major motion pictures followed, including Dodsworth (1936), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), and The Prisoner of Zenda (1937). By 1938, he was starring as a leading man in films such as Wuthering Heights (1939). Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Niven returned to Britain and rejoined the army, being recommissioned as a lieutenant. In 1942, he co-starred in the morale-building film about the development of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter, The First of the Few (1942).\nHe went on to receive the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Separate Tables (1958). Other notable films during this time period include A Matter of Life and Death (1946), The Bishop's Wife (1947), Enchantment (1948), The Elusive Pimpernel (1950), The Moon Is Blue (1953), Around the World in 80 Days (1956), My Man Godfrey (1957), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Murder by Death (1976), and Death on the Nile (1978). He also earned acclaim and notoriety playing Sir Charles Lytton in The Pink Panther (1963) and James Bond in Casino Royale (1967).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:35:35.117200+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3852, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Niven"}], "uuid": "ee50b66b-f559-4f69-bc34-540ebab7fd0d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38500", "external_references": [{"id": 25186, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q181917"}, {"id": 28077, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "59189997"}, {"id": 28078, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50005975"}, {"id": 28079, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50005975"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:01:23.823471+10:00"}, {"id": 77990, "name": "Mia Farrow", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2183049, "title": "Death on the Nile", "work_id": 85589, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Maria de Lourdes Villiers Farrow", "date_of_birth": "1945-02-09", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Maria de Lourdes Villiers \"Mia\" Farrow ( mə-REE-ə dee LOORDZ VIL-yərz FARR-oh; born February 9, 1945) is an American actress. She first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera Peyton Place and gained further recognition for her subsequent short-lived marriage to Frank Sinatra. An early film role, as Rosemary in Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby (1968), saw her nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. She went on to appear in several films throughout the 1970s, such as Follow Me! (1972), The Great Gatsby (1974), and Death on the Nile (1978). Her younger sister is Prudence Farrow.\nFarrow was in a relationship with actor-director Woody Allen from 1980 to 1992 and appeared in thirteen of his fourteen films over that period, beginning with A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several Allen films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for Broadway Danny Rose (1984), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), and Alice (1990), and a BAFTA nomination for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986). In 1992, following a visit by Allen in the Farrow country house, Dylan told her mother there was an incident of sexual abuse. Mia brought her child to the pediatrician who informed the police that he had sexually assaulted their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan. Allen was never charged with a crime and has vigorously denied the allegation. These claims received significant renewed public attention in 2013 after Dylan recounted the alleged assault in an interview that year.\nSince the 2000s, Farrow has made occasional appearances on television, including a recurring role on Third Watch (2001–2003). She has also had supporting parts in such films as The Omen (2006), Be Kind Rewind (2008), and Dark Horse (2011). Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She is involved in humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, Time magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:12:15.515329+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4675, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow"}], "uuid": "d6039a79-6eca-42c5-b577-f21f28cbbd35", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33226", "external_references": [{"id": 25262, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q202725"}, {"id": 30277, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "115458428"}, {"id": 30278, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85151771"}, {"id": 30279, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85151771"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:02:05.465322+10:00"}, {"id": 77989, "name": "Alastair Reid", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 790142, "title": "Nostromo.

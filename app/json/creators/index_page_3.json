This award follows the path of MMCA’s Artist of the Year exhibitions, which was held from 1995 to 2010 and hence it has been re-established to discover and sponsor artists who have ardently persisted in paving their own way to artistic success, thus providing an avenue for the advancement of Korean contemporary art.\nKorea Artist Prize selects maximum of four artists (or teams of artists) as ‘SBS Foundation sponsored Artists’ with latent potential through the first-round evaluation process. These exhibiting artists will receive 40 million won as exhibition support fund to participate in the Korea Artist Prize exhibition held at MMCA, Korea. In the second-round evaluation, a final winner will be announced based on the exhibition with vast capability and stunning achievement. Additionally, SBS will air documentaries to illuminate the oeuvres of the participating artists.\n\nFor a clear and fair selection process, the exhibition steering committee, consisting of established art professionals, operates the fundamental system for two years. This steering committee selects 10 recommenders each year. These recommenders represent the highly selective pool of critics, scholars, curators, and contributors of art magazines. After an extensive discussion, the 10 recommenders yield a selection of 6~10 artists. Korea Artist Prize does not hold limitations on the age and artistic genre of the selected artists and it only requires artist’s significant contribution to Korean contemporary art with creating new dialogue within the international audience. The steering committee also invites directors and independent curators from various international art institutions to judge these nominated artists throughout the two rounds of evaluation processes in selecting the final winner.\nThe SBS Foundation and the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea hereby wishes Korea Artist Prize to become a path for Korean contemporary art to communicate with the wide range of audience. For this, we will strive to assist and promote artists leading the contemporary art trend and discourse of Korea.\n\nSource: Korea Artist Prize, accessed 3/1/2025, <https://koreaartistprize.org/en/about/>.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-02-12T03:45:46.984443+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "cb5782b7-fe83-48af-979b-6d040814c8fa", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40878", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-02-12T03:45:46.984667+11:00"}, {"id": 87813, "name": "Arts Council Korea", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2594398, "title": "Delivery Dancer's Arc: 0° Receiver", "work_id": 122676, "role": "sponsor", "role_id": 625, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1973", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "Established as the Korea Culture and Arts Foundation in 1973 it was later restructured as Arts Council Korea in 2005, following the reenactment of the Korea\nCulture and Arts Promotion Act.\nSince its foundation ARKO has led the formulation and implementation of arts and culture policy on the basis of the official National Culture and Arts Policy\nset by the Korean government.\nARKO is governed by council members who are appointed by the Ministry of Culture Sports and Tourism.

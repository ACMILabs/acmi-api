He acted in more than 100 films, in roles covering a wide range of genres. In his later years, Curtis made numerous television appearances.\nHe achieved his first major recognition as a dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with co-star Burt Lancaster. The following year he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for The Defiant Ones (1958) alongside Sidney Poitier (who was also nominated in the same category).

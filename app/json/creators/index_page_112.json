Minogue is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 80 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music as well as fashion, and is referred to by the European press as the \"Princess of Pop\" and a style icon. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, three Brit Awards and seventeen ARIA Music Awards.\nBorn and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, playing tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including \"I Should Be So Lucky\", \"The Loco-Motion\", \"Especially for You\", \"Hand on Your Heart\", and \"Better the Devil You Know\". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released Kylie Minogue (1994) and Impossible Princess (1997), both of which received positive reviews. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's Light Years, including the number-one hits \"Spinning Around\" and \"On a Night Like This\". The follow-up, Fever (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, \"Love at First Sight\" and \"In Your Eyes\", became hits, with its lead single, \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" becoming one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.\nMinogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as \"Slow\", \"I Believe in You\", \"2 Hearts\", \"All the Lovers\", \"Dancing\" and \"Padam Padam\". In the UK charts, she is the only female artist to have a chart-topping album and top ten single, from the 1980s to the 2020s.\nIn film, Minogue made her debut in The Delinquents (1989). She has also appeared in the films Street Fighter (1994) as Cammy, Moulin Rouge! (2001), Holy Motors (2012) and San Andreas (2015). In reality television, she appeared as a judge on the third series of The Voice UK and The Voice Australia both in 2014. Her other ventures include product endorsements, books, fashion, charitable work and wine brand.\nMinogue was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to music. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. While touring in 2005, Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) degree by Anglia Ruskin University in 2011 for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. At the 2011 ARIA Music Awards, Minogue was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. She was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the 2019 Australia Day Honours.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T22:13:00.137593+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5967, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Minogue"}], "uuid": "94f567f4-e98d-4ee9-a71c-132009052779", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34606", "external_references": [{"id": 42865, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q11998"}, {"id": 55021, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "69117273"}, {"id": 55022, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91121538"}, {"id": 55023, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91121538"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:49.458656+11:00"}, {"id": 84419, "name": "Yothu Yindi", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686574, "title": "Treaty – Yothu Yindi", "work_id": 118023, "role": "musician", "role_id": 169, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:49.554665+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "000d1604-7f3b-4887-b0c2-7e2998adb54d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39727", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:48.085572+11:00"}, {"id": 84418, "name": "Mick Bell", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686573, "title": "Leaps and Bounds – Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls", "work_id": 118022, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:48.675739+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "82476e7e-2f69-4413-9906-a3037b8bf7f4", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39725", "external_references": [{"id": 50985, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121357546"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:47.300188+11:00"}, {"id": 84417, "name": "Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686572, "title": "Leaps and Bounds – Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls", "work_id": 118022, "role": "musician", "role_id": 169, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:48.065804+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "1e3c9193-ec75-49e2-88cd-993ba5834d0b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39726", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:46.610120+11:00"}, {"id": 84416, "name": "Kris Moyes", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686571, "title": "My People – The Presets", "work_id": 118021, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1978-10-30", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "biography": "Kris Moyes (born 30 October 1978) is an Australian-born director and producer and founder of KMOYES PICTURES. He is perhaps best known for his innovative music videos.\nIn 2005 he directed The Presets \"Are You The One?\" which utilized a large array of film techniques that playfully proposed answers to who the \"one\" is. The video also featured a digital artifact motif he developed by interrupting the transfer of DIVX files of original footage from a PC to a MAC computer, to which many homage videos were made.Moyes has had close ties to Modular Records since 2005. He is probably better known for his videos for Softlightes and The Presets. In 2008 Moyes directed a traditional performance based music video for Wolfmother \"White Unicorn\" on the condition that Pav, the head of Modular Records allowed him to deface his own work and re-release it, under the pseudonym Banditobruce. The piece of subterfuge was a reference to Marcel Duchamp's Readymade, L.H.O.O.Q.\nMoyes has also directed four music videos for Sia. His first video for Sia's \"Buttons\" in 2007 was linked by Perez Hilton on his blog and received over 300,000 views in one day, becoming the No.1 Most Linked Music Video and No.2 Most Viewed Music Video on YouTube.In 2010 Moyes directed and co-wrote a satirical short film, called \"City Limits\" featuring costumes by Australian fashion label, Romance Was Born.  It was screened at ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film) at the Centre Pompidou, Paris.\nMoyes has also been exhibited alongside John Baldessari, Brian Bress, Miranda July, Peter Sutherland, Paper Rad, Melanie Bonajo, Michael Gondry, Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, Mark Romanek and Floria Sigmondi.Over the years, Moyes has appeared in a number of publications including, L.A. Times, Esquire, Tokion, The Open Day Book and The New York Times where he was invited alongside Jeff Koons, Banks Violette, Oscar de la Renta and The Campana Brothers to re-design the ' T ' Logo for The New York Times Style Magazine.Between 2015-2018, Moyes redesigned the identity for Australia's longest running TV program RAGE, the first redesign in over 30 years.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T22:11:56.657918+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5965, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Moyes"}], "uuid": "23a8250a-6325-484a-91da-b196c9dd7d42", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39723", "external_references": [{"id": 35362, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6437254"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:45.817163+11:00"}, {"id": 84415, "name": "The Presets", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686570, "title": "My People – The Presets", "work_id": 118021, "role": "musician", "role_id": 169, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:46.557182+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c5659f12-e989-4923-bdbb-1ef738a68db2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39724", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:45.249922+11:00"}, {"id": 84414, "name": "Rob Leggatt and Leigh Marling", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686569, "title": "Since I Left You – The Avalanches", "work_id": 118020, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:45.666574+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "da800a5e-40eb-4af7-9086-0d71e88a1d29", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39721", "external_references": [{"id": 51521, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121357565"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:44.467615+11:00"}, {"id": 84413, "name": "The Avalanches", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686568, "title": "Since I Left You – The Avalanches", "work_id": 118020, "role": "musician", "role_id": 169, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:45.046370+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "f97262c4-e9e6-4f39-89ce-166bc97d398e", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39722", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:43.897022+11:00"}, {"id": 84412, "name": "Sunny Leunig", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686567, "title": "Elevator Operator – Courtney Barnett", "work_id": 118019, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:44.161661+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2296ae61-6f50-4e67-97e4-84f3f01fd4c1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39719", "external_references": [{"id": 33910, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121035385"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:43.124495+11:00"}, {"id": 84411, "name": "Courtney Barnett", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2686566, "title": "Elevator Operator – Courtney Barnett", "work_id": 118019, "role": "musician", "role_id": 169, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-16T03:56:43.527317+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "b5ceb1b1-415c-45fb-bd0f-fa0fc3a46338", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39720", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:25:42.549166+11:00"}]}

His son, also named Val Lewton, was a painter and exhibition designer.\nLewton was born in Yalta, Imperial Russia and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1909. He began his career as a writer, producing novels, including the best-selling pulp novel No Bed of Her Own. Lewton worked as a writer and publicist for MGM before being named head of RKO's horror unit in 1942. His first production, Cat People, became a top moneymaker for RKO that year. Lewton produced several successful films, often writing the final draft of the screenplays himself. He gave first directing opportunities to Robert Wise and Mark Robson and worked with Boris Karloff, who credited Lewton with saving his career. After leaving RKO, Lewton worked for Paramount and MGM, producing various films. His life and work have inspired books, documentaries, and an upcoming feature film.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T17:22:32.242993+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3244, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Lewton"}], "uuid": "1fafc4a8-4a47-4774-b7ac-ee24d9619ae9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30039", "external_references": [{"id": 13734, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q221917"}, {"id": 13735, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "44464408"}, {"id": 13736, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83313890"}, {"id": 13737, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83313890"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T02:02:37.032450+10:00"}

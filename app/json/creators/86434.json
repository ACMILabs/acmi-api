By merging light with the concept of space, questions arise about the complex nature of vision and about the limits and possibilities of the viewer's perception. Early works include aperture-like pieces, with light trapping hallways, acting as photographic darkrooms; many are simple, standard drywall constructions with commercial light fixtures. But the effects are compelling and highlight the nature of seeing: what appears to be a window, for example, becomes a physical skin of light holding onto to the wall. His largest exterior work is Roden Crater, 1972-c.2000 [http://www.rodencrater.org], a natural cinder volcano situated on the south western edge of the Painted Desert in northern Arizona. James Turrell is transforming the crater into a panoramic artwork that relates, through the medium of light, to the universe of the surrounding sky, desert landscape and local Hopi culture.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T06:01:54.947323+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "37508122-906e-4bab-b01a-bf0315d00f24", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110742", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T06:01:54.947541+11:00"}

His bespectacled\r\n\"Glasses\" character was a resourceful, ambitious go-getter who matched the zeitgeist of the 1920s-era United States.\r\nHis films frequently contained \"thrill sequences\" of extended chase scenes and daredevil physical feats. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) is considered one of the most enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd performed the lesser stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the thumb and index finger of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, and was almost undetectable on the screen).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:42:07+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2194, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd"}], "uuid": "ff1e225f-ae10-4835-adc6-43273f43b187", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20274", "external_references": [{"id": 9439, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q104340"}, {"id": 9440, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "17347452"}, {"id": 9441, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50050609"}, {"id": 9442, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50050609"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T13:15:10.469430+10:00"}

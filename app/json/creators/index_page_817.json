Initially known for playing tough guys with a tender heart, he went on to achieve success with more complex, and challenging roles over a 45-year career in films and television series. He was a four-time nominee for the Academy Award for Best Actor (winning once), and he also won two BAFTA Awards and one Golden Globe Award for Best Lead Actor. The American Film Institute ranks Lancaster as #19 of the greatest male stars of classic Hollywood cinema.Lancaster performed as a circus acrobat in the 1930s. After serving in World War II, the 32-year-old Lancaster landed a role in a Broadway play and drew the attention of a Hollywood agent. His breakthrough role was in the film noir The Killers in 1946 alongside Ava Gardner.  A critical success, it launched both of their careers. Not long after in 1948, Lancaster starred alongside Barbara Stanwyck in the commercially and critically acclaimed film Sorry, Wrong Number where he portrayed the husband to her bedridden, invalid character. In 1953, Lancaster played the illicit lover of Deborah Kerr in the military drama From Here to Eternity. A box office smash, it won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and landed a Best Actor nomination for Lancaster.\nLater in the 1950s, he starred in The Rainmaker (1956), with Katharine Hepburn, earning a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination, and in 1957 he starred in Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) with frequent co-star Kirk Douglas. During the 1950s, his production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was highly successful, with Lancaster acting in films such as: Trapeze (1956), a box office smash in which he used his acrobatic skills and for which he won the Silver Bear for Best Actor; Sweet Smell of Success (1957), a dark drama today considered a classic; Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), a WWII submarine drama with Clark Gable; and Separate Tables (1958), a hotel-set drama which received seven Oscar nominations.\nIn the early 1960s, Lancaster starred in a string of critically successful films, each in very disparate roles. Playing a charismatic biblical con-man in Elmer Gantry in 1960 won him the Academy Award and the Golden Globe for Best Actor. He played a Nazi war criminal in 1961 in the all-star, war-crime-trial film, Judgment at Nuremberg. Playing a bird expert prisoner in Birdman of Alcatraz in 1962, he earned the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor and his third Oscar nomination. In 1963, Lancaster traveled to Italy to star as an Italian prince in Visconti's epic period drama The Leopard. In 1964, he played a US Air Force General who, opposed by a Colonel played by Douglas, tries to overthrow the President in Seven Days in May. Then, in 1966, he played an explosives expert in the western The Professionals. Although the reception of his 1968 film The Swimmer was initially lackluster upon release, in the years after it has grown in stature critically and attained a cult following.\nIn 1970, Lancaster starred in the box-office hit, air-disaster drama Airport. In 1974 he again starred in a Visconti film, Conversation Piece. He experienced a career resurgence in 1980 with the crime-romance Atlantic City, winning the BAFTA for Best Actor and landing his fourth Oscar nomination. Starting in the late 1970s, he also appeared in television mini-series, including the award-winning Separate but Equal with Sidney Poitier. He continued acting into his late 70s, until a stroke in 1990 forced him to retire; four years later he died from a heart attack. His final film role was in the Oscar-nominated Field of Dreams.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:16:20.266966+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5721, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster"}], "uuid": "b7e20a56-927e-497c-987d-dfb8ebea9333", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 35869, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q160528"}, {"id": 54122, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "115079271"}, {"id": 54123, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83065628"}, {"id": 54124, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83065628"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:16:25.315938+10:00"}, {"id": 77331, "name": "Montgomery Clift", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1986920, "title": "Judgment at Nuremberg", "work_id": 83107, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1920-10-17", "date_of_death": "1966-07-23", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Edward Montgomery Clift (; October 17, 1920 – July 23, 1966) was an American actor.

He also executed a rare move by not signing a contract after arriving in Hollywood, only doing so after his first two films were a success.

Her performance as Lola-Lola in Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel (1930) brought her international acclaim and a contract with Paramount Pictures. She starred in many Hollywood films, including six iconic roles directed by Sternberg: Morocco (1930) (her only Academy Award nomination), Dishonored (1931), Shanghai Express and Blonde Venus (both 1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934), The Devil Is a Woman (1935), Desire (1936), and Destry Rides Again (1939). She successfully traded on her glamorous persona and exotic looks, and became one of the era's highest-paid actresses. Throughout World War II, she was a high-profile entertainer in the United States. Although she delivered notable performances in several post-war films, including Billy Wilder's A Foreign Affair (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright (1950), Billy Wilder's Witness for the Prosecution (1957), Orson Welles's Touch of Evil (1958), and Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), she spent most of the 1950s to the 1970s touring the world as a marquee live-show performer.\nDietrich was known for her humanitarian efforts during World War II, housing German and French exiles, providing financial support and even advocating their American citizenship. For her work on improving morale on the front lines during the war, she received several honors from the United States, France, Belgium, and Israel. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Dietrich the ninth greatest female screen legend of classic Hollywood cinema.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T22:47:45.094642+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6005, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich"}], "uuid": "4a63e156-77e9-4c4a-b723-6c6cf30c9050", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 51352, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4612"}, {"id": 55177, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "97773925"}, {"id": 55178, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50032559"}, {"id": 55179, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50032559"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:47:49.034217+10:00"}, {"id": 77329, "name": "Richard Widmark", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1986916, "title": "Judgment at Nuremberg", "work_id": 83107, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2614962, "title": "The Bedford incident", "work_id": 84580, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Richard Weedt Widmark", "date_of_birth": "26 DEC 1914", "date_of_death": "24 MAR 2008", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Richard Weedt Widmark (December 26, 1914 – March 24, 2008) was an American film, stage, and television actor and producer.\n\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as the villainous Tommy Udo in his debut film, Kiss of Death (1947), for which he also won the Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer.

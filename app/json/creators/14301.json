His biting satirical caricatures were published in most of the Bulgarian newspapers.\nDonev's works are characterized with simplified lines, the plasticity of the motion, and vivid expressiveness. He was the first to use a deformed manner of speaking and interjections as a sound image of a second plan, accompanied with the sounds of drums and bagpipes.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:42:30.030382+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3912, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donyo_Donev"}], "uuid": "39342b89-5d35-4166-9150-73c9a98a5fd2", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18339", "external_references": [{"id": 25918, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5296942"}, {"id": 28247, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "71599210"}, {"id": 28248, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81047272"}, {"id": 28249, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81047272"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T13:27:38.601005+11:00"}

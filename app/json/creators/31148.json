During his short career, he completed numerous short films, in addition to a pair of highly regarded features, of which the first, The Mother and the Whore, is considered a key work of post-Nouvelle Vague French cinema.\nIn his obituary for Eustache, the critic Serge Daney wrote:In the thread of the desolate 70s, his films succeeded one another, always unforeseen, without a system, without a gap: film-rivers, short films, TV programs, hyperreal fiction. Each film went to the end of its material, from real to fictional sorrow. It was impossible for him to go against it, to calculate, to take cultural success into account, impossible for this theoretician of seduction to seduce an audience.\nJim Jarmusch dedicated his 2005 film Broken Flowers to Eustache.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:26:53.475409+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4296, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Eustache"}], "uuid": "e4875a22-bf01-4f80-b183-988e4173d7f1", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21530", "external_references": [{"id": 25654, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q966198"}, {"id": 29288, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "71409609"}, {"id": 29289, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85112709"}, {"id": 29290, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85112709"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:30:21.914358+10:00"}

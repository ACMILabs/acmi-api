This gang of youths roamed the streets of suburban Melbourne from 1974-1981.\n\nJenkins captured those turbulent years on film. \"Sharpies\" with a unique fashion of their own had an intimidating presence and appearance, which earned them an infamous reputation as they fought their way out of the 1970's and the urban culture they grew up in. These compelling photographs represent the period from 1974 -1976 when the gang was at its most united, striking fear and awe within their rivals and the general public.\n\nIn recent years these photos have attracted the interest of Australian filmmakers, as reference points. Fashion magazines worldwide have published several of Jenkins photos for their impressive style and substance. The Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney has recently held a 3-month exhibition entitled \"Sharpies\". This collection of 50 photographs by Larry Jenkins was presented by renowned Melbourne artist Peter Robertson (also a member of the gang.)\n\nThe exhibition traveled from Sydney to Melbourne in 2002 and was viewed by over 40,000 patrons. Since then, interest in this uniquely Melbourne sub-culture generated by these remarkable time frames seen through the eyes of Larry Jenkins, has attracted attention from major Television, Radio and Media Institutions across the country, as the public and the press want to know what it was like to be a \"Blackburn South Sharp\".", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:52:06.299825+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "9d4b6239-26c3-4c0d-abc2-52047f7c7fc6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "112203", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:52:06.300086+11:00"}

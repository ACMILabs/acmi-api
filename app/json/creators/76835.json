She began her acting career in theatre, and in 1944 made her first film for MGM.\nDespite a featured role in It's a Wonderful Life (1946), MGM did not believe she had the potential for major success, and sold her contract to RKO Studios. Often cast in film noir projects, Grahame was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Crossfire (1947), and later won the award for her work in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952). After starring opposite Humphrey Bogart in In A Lonely Place (1950), she achieved her highest profile with Sudden Fear (1952), The Big Heat (1953), Human Desire (1954), and Oklahoma! (1955), but her film career began to wane soon afterwards.\nGrahame returned to work on the stage, but continued to appear in films and television productions, usually in supporting roles.\nIn 1974, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. It went into remission less than a year later and Grahame returned to work. In 1980, the cancer returned, but Grahame refused to accept the diagnosis or seek treatment. Choosing instead to continue working, she traveled to the United Kingdom to appear in a play. Her health, however, declined rapidly. She returned to New York City, where she died in October 1981, aged 57.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:02:21.469300+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4080, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Grahame"}], "uuid": "426a368e-76c2-42f7-930c-cce42bc316ca", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 26716, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q59314"}, {"id": 28700, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "48684"}, {"id": 28701, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n86036599"}, {"id": 28702, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n86036599"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T15:02:24.702587+10:00"}

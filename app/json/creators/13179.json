At age 23 he began working for the government-owned National Film Unit of New Zealand, joining a group of emerging filmmakers who were investigating new subjects and creative film making styles.\nPillsbury directed seven films at the National Film Unit, including a multi-faceted study of artist Ralph Hotere, and a satirical look at workplace relations (Men and Supermen). He was also part of the directing team on Commonwealth Games chronicle Games '74, and worked both on set and at the editing bench for Paul Maunder's Gone Up North for a While.\nPillsbury embarked on a solo career in 1975. His documentary, \"Birth with R.D. Laing,\" garnered awards in both Australia and New Zealand, while also generating controversy in England and the United States. The film prominently showcased the outspoken Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, as he critiqued the Western medical approach to childbirth. Pillsbury also worked on four documentaries for TV slot Seven Days, which variously looked into life for a solo mother, an ex-convict, hospital patients, and young Māori in the city.\nMore TV documentaries followed, then in 1978, Against the Lights, a short drama based on a Witi Ihimaera tale. Pillsbury's Round the Bays doco The Greatest Run on Earth won awards at festivals in Chicago and Torino.\nPillsbury's feature film debut in 1981 was with The Scarecrow, based on the gothic novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson. Presented through the eyes of two teenage boys, the film chronicles the arrival in a 50s town of a mysterious stranger (played by American movie legend John Carradine). In 1982 The Scarecrow became the first Kiwi film to win invitation to the prestigious Cannes Film Festival, in the non-competitive Director's Fortnight section. Teen star Jono Smith later reinvented himself as a cinematographer in England.\nPillsbury then worked extensively on a screen adaptation of end of the world sci-fi novel The Quiet Earth, before handing the project to director Geoff Murphy after deciding it needed fresh eyes (he later joked at being one of the only directors who had fired himself). Instead Pillsbury helmed 1880s immigrant tale Heart of the High Country for TV (based on a novel by Elizabeth Gowans), then segued into period road movie Starlight Hotel, which starred Smash Palace discovery Greer Robson.\nSince Starlight Hotel, Pillsbury has directed extensively, mainly on American tele-movies. He returned to Kiwi moviemaking in 2000 for Crooked Earth, the tale of a clash between two Māori: a militant drug-dealer, and former military man Temuera Morrison.\nPillsbury's other features include Free Willy 3: The Rescue, 2008 road movie Endless Bummer and Where The Red Fern Grows.\nThese days Pillsbury has a second career as a winemaker. In 2000 he and a business partner planted a Vineyard in Cochise County, Arizona, and in 2006 sold it to a group headed by Maynard James Keenan. Pillsbury Wine Company was launched soon afterwards, with his new vineyard & tasting room across the road in Willcox, Arizona, and a Tasting Room in Old Town Cottonwood, Arizona.Pillsbury Wine has earned several national awards including Gold Medals in the Jefferson Cup, and several Double Gold Medals in the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition.Pillsbury's wife is the daughter of sculptor Geny Dignac.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:58:38.035389+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5110, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pillsbury"}], "uuid": "65dbf3f3-be3c-4962-b584-0150c8838709", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28488", "external_references": [{"id": 26917, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7408020"}, {"id": 31390, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "86739235"}, {"id": 31391, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no98079432"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:32:33.946262+10:00"}

He is best known for his Shakespearean roles, especially King Lear. He often appeared in film, rising from a bit part actor to leading roles; by the time of his death he had appeared in nearly 140 films. His later work was predominantly in television and radio.\nBorn in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, into a family with no theatrical connections, Hordern was educated at Windlesham House School in Pulborough, West Sussex. He went on to Brighton College, where his interest in the theatre developed. After leaving the college he joined an amateur dramatics company, and came to the notice of several influential Shakespearean directors who cast him in minor roles in Othello and Macbeth. During the Second World War he served on HMS Illustrious, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. Upon demobilisation he resumed his acting career and made his television debut, becoming a bit-part actor in many films, particularly in the war film genre.\nHordern came to prominence in the early 1950s when he took part in a theatrical competition at the Arts Theatre in London. This led to a season-long contract at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, where he played major parts including Caliban in The Tempest, Jaques in As You Like It, and Sir Politick Would-Be in Ben Jonson's comedy Volpone. The following season Hordern joined Michael Benthall's company at the Old Vic where, among other parts, he played Polonius in Hamlet, and the title role in King John. In 1957 he won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his role as the barrister in John Mortimer's courtroom drama The Dock Brief. Along with his theatrical responsibilities Hordern had regular supporting roles in various films including Cleopatra (1963), and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966).\nIn the late 1960s Hordern met the British theatre director Jonathan Miller, who cast him in \"Whistle and I'll Come to You\", which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern's next major play was Jumpers at the Royal National Theatre in 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. Hordern's television credits towards the end of his life included Paradise Postponed, the BAFTA award-winning Memento Mori, and the BBC adaptation of Middlemarch. He was appointed a CBE in 1972 and was knighted eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995 aged 83.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:14:24.029707+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4694, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hordern"}], "uuid": "467fa3ed-b065-4dc3-b718-55da8535f1ae", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34144", "external_references": [{"id": 25482, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q956867"}, {"id": 30319, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "59274057"}, {"id": 30320, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91003094"}, {"id": 30321, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91003094"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:06:06.132459+10:00"}

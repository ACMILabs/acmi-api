The video camera becomes a mediator between the two presences, revealing the relationships and reactions of one to the other.\n\nAsher's hand-held camera zooms in and magnifies details; for example, the hands of a stranger on a subway, or images recorded from international television in a foreign hotel. These voyeuristic notations are shot at an anthropological distance, yet magically transform publicly experienced moments into intimate, often highly poetic instances. Asher's videotapes were preceded by his work in painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography.\n\nDan Asher was born in 1947 in Cleveland, Ohio. He has had solo exhibitions at Galerie Lelong, Zurich; Galerie de Expeditie, Amsterdam; Tomio Koyama Gallery, Tokyo; Burnett Miller Gallery, Los Angeles; Factual Nonsense, London; John Good Gallery, New York. Asher lives in New York.\n\nReferences:\nFar From the Madding Crowd, 1996, 9:17 min, color, sound\nNotes From the Underground, 1996, 18:26 min, color, sound\nDead Man Walking, 2:27 min.\nTo Sleep But Not To Dream, 4:22 min.\nHide and Sikh, 1:23 min.\nMonument, 6:40 min.\nNowhere Man, 2:54 min.\nTo Repel Ghosts, 1996, 21:43 min, color, sound\nArtificial Illuminations, 1997, 10:15 min, color, sound\nMoonshine, 1:42 min.\nCalligraphic, 1:07 min.\nArtificial River Light, 1:16 min.\nSine, 1:20 min.\nFire Sign, 1:12 min.\nAurora, 1:44 min.\nIrregular/regular, 1:01 min.\nWill the Circle Be Unbroken, 47 sec.\nJapan Tapes, 1997, 18:19 min, color, sound\nJapan Tapes # 1 1997, 8:03 min, color.\nIt's Your Day, 1:18 min.\nSalary Man, 53 sec.\nThis Stop, Next Stop, 2:05 min.\nKind 'A' Gear, 58 sec.\nNara, 29 sec.\nNickelodeon, 45 sec.\nFaceless, 40 sec.\nNerves and Laughter, 30 sec.\nIchikawa-san, 3:29 min.\nJapan Tapes #21997, 10:16 min, color.\nTropical Vacation, 54 sec.\nCut-o, 1:42 min.\nEyes of the Beholder, 51 min.\nSeek and Hide, 40 sec.\nSteven Spielberg, 1:05 min.\nWonder, 51 sec.\nFranchised Shakiness, 38 sec.\nLDTV, 1997, 19:06 min, color, sound\nLove Conquers All, 4:32 min.\nTurn the Other Cheek, 2:33 min.\nAerobic Aryans, 1:58 min.\nMinsk Meet, 3:40 min.\nMeter Man, 2:29 min.\nWho's Cheating Whom, 1:10 min.\nMeanwhile Back Here On Earth, 2:45 min.\nBristory, 1:19 min.\nNew Pepsi Generation, 1997, 1:06 min, color, sound\nTheological Christian, 1997, 8 min, color, sound\nWaiting for Godot, 1997, 7:53 min, color, sound\nYokohama, 1997, 5:28 min, color, sound", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:36:26.099759+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "d8af7cd2-63d6-4eae-a2eb-93db11c622ff", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110019", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:36:26.099970+11:00"}

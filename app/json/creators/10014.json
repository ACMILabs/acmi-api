From his famed Sirius Remembered (1959), Mothlight (1963) and Dog Star Man (1961-64) to the anti-narrative, visual explorations of form and structure in The Art of Vision (1965) and The Text of Light (1974), Brakhage filmed not just the world but the act of seeing the world.  Questioning the relationship between moving image representation and the world, Brakhage strove to make the viewer aware of vision as a dynamic, nerve-centered event.\n\nAmong the first filmmakers to alter the filmstrip for expressive effect, he scratched, painted, dyed and overlayed patterns directly onto the negative right up until his very last film, the unfinished Chinese Series\n(2003).  After his death in 2003, the Museum of Modern Art in New York is now in the process of preserving all of Brakhage's 400-odd films for their permanent collection.\n\n(PROOF exhibition bio 2004) SW", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-11T15:09:10.633362+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "202d4aea-f0fa-49cd-be77-66b303ab33da", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110651", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-08-11T15:09:10.633588+10:00"}

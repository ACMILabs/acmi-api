Along with Luis Buñuel and Pedro Almodóvar, he is considered to be one of Spain’s most renowned filmmakers. He has a long and prolific career that spans over half a century. His films have won many international awards.\nSaura began his career in 1955 making documentary shorts. He quickly gained international prominence when his first feature-length film premiered at Cannes Film Festival in 1960. Although he started filming as a neorealist, Saura quickly switched to films encoded with metaphors and symbolism in order to get around the Spanish censors. In 1966, he was thrust into the international spotlight when his film La Caza won the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. In the following years, he forged an international reputation for his cinematic treatment of emotional and spiritual responses to repressive political conditions.\nBy the 1970s, Saura was the best known filmmaker working in Spain. His films employed complex narrative devices and were frequently controversial. He won Special Jury Awards for La Prima Angélica (1973) and Cría Cuervos (1975) in Cannes; and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film nomination in 1979 for Mama Cumple 100 Años.  \nIn the 1980s, Saura was in the spotlight for his Flamenco trilogy – Bodas de Sangre, Carmen and El Amor Brujo, in which he combined dramatic content and flamenco dance forms. His work continued to be featured in worldwide competitions and earned numerous awards. He received two nominations for Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, for Carmen (1983) and Tango (1998). His films are sophisticated expression of time and space fusing reality with fantasy, past with present, and memory with hallucination. In the last two decades of the 20th century, Saura has concentrated on works uniting music, dance and images.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:01:27.982016+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1777, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Saura"}], "uuid": "7b71624f-08b9-4494-8a0f-198e7b04c7f5", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16506", "external_references": [{"id": 7744, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q295855"}, {"id": 7745, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "98182130"}, {"id": 7746, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n82113048"}, {"id": 7747, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n82113048"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:28:37.686776+10:00"}, {"id": 22964, "name": "Emiliano Piedra", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1807645, "title": "Carmen", "work_id": 80844, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Emiliano Piedra Miana", "date_of_birth": "1931-01-01", "date_of_death": "1991-08-28", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 10, "name": "Spanish", "slug": "spanish"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 14, "name": "Spain", "slug": "spain"}], "biography": "Emiliano Piedra Miana (1931–August 28, 1991) was a Spanish film producer.He was married from 1967 until his death to actress Emma Penella.

During the 1960s, Rob Houwer became one of the most prolific producers in Germany, with directors Volker Schlöndorff (A Degree of Murder, Man on Horseback), Peter Fleischmann (Hunting Scenes from Bavaria), Johannes Schaaf (Tattoo), Michael Verhoeven (Up the Establishment, o.k.) and Hans-Jürgen Syberberg (Romy: Anatomy of a Face). Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1971, he frequently collaborated with Paul Verhoeven and produced most of his Dutch films. Turkish Delight (1973), based on the novel by Jan Wolkers, became the most frequently visited film in Dutch cinema and still holds that place today.  The relationship between Houwer and Verhoeven ended when Verhoeven moved to the US in 1985. Houwer's later films did not always enjoy the huge commercial success of his early productions. The Dragon That Wasn't (Or Was He?), supervised by Houwer and artist Marten Toonder became the All-Time Number One Dutch animated feature at the box office. Some of his later productions were considered to be among the worst in Dutch cinema by critics: De gulle Minnaar (1990), De Zeemeerman (1996) and Het woeden der gehele wereld (2006).

Egoyan's most critically acclaimed film is the drama The Sweet Hereafter (1997), for which he received two Academy Award nominations, and his biggest commercial success is the erotic thriller Chloe (2009). He is considered by local film critic Geoff Pevere to be one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation.Egoyan's work often explores themes of alienation and isolation, featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy, or other power structures. Egoyan's films often follow non-linear plot structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information.In 2008, Egoyan received the Dan David Prize for \"Creative Rendering of the Past.\" Egoyan later received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, Canada's highest royal honour in the performing arts, in 2015.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T10:53:23.614530+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1690, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Egoyan"}], "uuid": "005c612e-bf72-4fd2-a333-db611d8aadb8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "15584", "external_references": [{"id": 7369, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q212167"}, {"id": 7370, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "14969748"}, {"id": 7371, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no93037272"}, {"id": 7372, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no93037272"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:28:20.746100+10:00"}, {"id": 22951, "name": "Ego Film Arts", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2223447, "title": "Exotica", "work_id": 89972, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2326549, "title": "The Adjuster", "work_id": 83981, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984827, "title": "Family Viewing", "work_id": 80836, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992496, "title": "The Sweet hereafter", "work_id": 88140, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T19:20:00.017671+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "4553553b-0c70-42bb-b213-ba0790287a21", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "4830", "external_references": [{"id": 35127, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121337631"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:27:29.001725+10:00"}]}

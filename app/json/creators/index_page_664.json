Sinatra is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150 million record sales.Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey and was greatly influenced by the intimate, easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". In 1946, Sinatra released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra. He then signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums. \nIn 1960, Sinatra left Capitol Records to start his own record label, Reprise Records, releasing a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album September of My Years and starred in the Emmy-winning television special Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music. After releasing Sinatra at the Sands in early 1966, Sinatra recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim. It was followed by 1968's Francis A. & Edward K. with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired in 1971 following the release of \"My Way\", but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, releasing \"New York, New York\" in 1980.\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for From Here to Eternity (1953), he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), which won him a Golden Globe Award. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\nIn 1983, Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra received eleven Grammy Awards including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was included in Time magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. American music critic Robert Christgau called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\" and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:52:07.825666+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2061, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra"}], "uuid": "c99e1c70-10d5-4668-b968-03c243064442", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "19172", "external_references": [{"id": 8894, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q40912"}, {"id": 8895, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "27253198"}, {"id": 8896, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50026395"}, {"id": 8897, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50026395"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:50:52.061724+10:00"}, {"id": 78899, "name": "Joseph Ruffalo", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2233239, "title": "Purple rain", "work_id": 88487, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T16:41:40+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "2fe03b8f-49cb-4063-a997-f96669415e44", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22745", "external_references": [{"id": 52036, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q76545519"}], "date_modified": "2024-09-10T16:21:28.340709+10:00"}]}

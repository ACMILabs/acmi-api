Hirsch is a graduate of The Putney School in Vermont and Hampshire College, in Amherst, Massachusetts.  He wrote and directed the documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony.Hirsch also contributed a chapter to Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture (The MIT Press, 2008), edited by Paul D. Miller (DJ Spooky).\nHis film Bully premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival.  Bully follows several families from across ethnic, cultural and geographic boundaries as they grapple with the tragedy their family has faced as a result of bullying.  Several of the families profiled in the film had lost a child because he or she became fed up with the mostly mental and sometimes physical abuse they experienced on a daily, even hourly basis at school, on the school bus, and in their communities.\nIn a screening of Bully in Minneapolis in September 2011, director Hirsch told the audience during the post-film Q & A that he himself had been bullied, and that was part of the inspiration for the film, and for the direction he took it. In an interview with Twin Cities Jewish news website TC Jewfolk after the screening Hirsch continued:\n\"I felt that the hardest part of being bullied was communicating,\" Hirsch said. \"And getting help.  I couldn’t enroll people's support.  People would say things like 'get over it,' even my own father and mother.  They weren’t with me.  That was a big part of my wanting to make the film. It’s cathartic on a daily basis.\"  Hirsch said he hoped the film grows far beyond him, inspiring advocacy, engagement, and empowerment not just in people who are being bullied and in their families, but by those of us who all too often stand by and do nothing.  He stated, \"I hope we build something that’s really sustainable.  I hope this takes on a life of its own.\" Hirsch is Jewish.In a Google+ Hangout on March 19, 2012, Lee Hirsch was interviewed by newscaster Tony McEwing at My Fox 11 LA studios, where Hirsch said: \"I want this to be a grassroots movement so that the local cities can get behind this movie and support it. This is a great way for people to get involved on social media to help raise awareness.\" The New York Times described Bully as \"moving and troubling\".", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:14:27.832681+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2560, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hirsch"}], "uuid": "201683a5-53c4-47d9-9068-a346eed03ac3", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23625", "external_references": [{"id": 10943, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6513896"}, {"id": 10944, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "61249249"}, {"id": 10945, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2004012284"}, {"id": 10946, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2004012284"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:30:56.609500+10:00"}, {"id": 37322, "name": "South African Broadcasting Corporation", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2087876, "title": "Amandla!

Natural Nylon was formed with the aim of giving those involved more control over their careers, 'supporting British acting talent, and keeping it in the UK'.Bryant had quit his job as cameraman in 1991 and, together with his wife, opened a club on Beak Street in London's Soho. He struck up a friendship with TV producer Bradley Adams, whose wife introduced them to Frost, who was going out with Law after meeting him on the set of Shopping. McGregor and Pertwee had also met Law through this film - Pertwee also appeared in it and McGregor read for the part that went to Law. Completing the line-up was Miller, a friend of Law since they met at the National Youth Music Theatre in their late teens. The majority of the group lived in the Primrose Hill area, and were part of the Primrose Hill set.\nNatural Nylon was formed in the late 90s, and the first film to be produced by Natural Nylon was David Cronenberg's eXistenZ (1999) which  was followed by Nora (2000), XX/XY (2002), Owning Mahowny (2003), To Kill a King (2003), and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004).  They co-produced an acclaimed adaptation of Dr Faustus at the Young Vic in 2002.Bryant and McGregor left the company in 2002, and Law resigned as director in January 2003, with the reason given as the taking off of the Hollywood careers of McGregor and Law. As the company was effectively wound down in early 2003, Variety wrote Natural Nylon never lived up to its Britpack hype. Founded seven years ago amid claims by the actor partners that it would enable them to take greater control over their careers, it only managed to get its name on four films — “eXistenZ,” “Nora” and the upcoming “To Kill a King” and “Owning Mahowny.” \n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:21:56.150757+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4764, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Nylon"}], "uuid": "3e94975c-dbb4-462e-9ba9-a5c97d4872fc", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10847", "external_references": [{"id": 25232, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q16955312"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:26:16.686119+10:00"}, {"id": 37314, "name": "H2O Motion Pictures", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2183156, "title": "Owning Mahowny", "work_id": 95138, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T14:56:15.547788+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3462aceb-153d-46dc-ba8e-36020024821d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "8952", "external_references": [{"id": 34501, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121091287"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:26:40.615015+10:00"}]}

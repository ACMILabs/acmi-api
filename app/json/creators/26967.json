ABPC also owned approximately 500 cinemas in Britain by 1943, and in the 1950s and 60s owned a station on the ITV television network. The studio was partly owned by Warner Bros. from about 1940 until 1969; the American company also owned a stake in ABPC's distribution arm, Warner-Path√©, from 1958. It formed one half of a vertically integrated film industry duopoly in Britain with the Rank Organisation.

Popular in his native Hong Kong, To has also found acclaim overseas. Intensely prolific, To has made films in a variety of genres, though in the West he is best known for his action and crime movies, which have earned him critical respect and a cult following, which includes American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino.To's biggest international successes include Breaking News, Election, Election 2 (a.k.a. Triad Election), Exiled, Mad Detective and Drug War; these films have appeared in a number of international film festivals, been distributed theatrically in France and the United States, and been widely sold to foreign countries.\nHis films, often made in collaboration with the same group of actors, screenwriters and cinematographers, frequently explore themes of friendship, fate and the changing face of Hong Kong society. Sometimes described as \"multifaceted and chameleonic\" due to his ability to switch tones and genres between movies, To is nonetheless seen as having a consistent style, which involves mixing subdued realism and social observation with highly stylised visual and acting elements. To has cited King Hu as the director who has influenced his work the most.To heads the Hong Kong-based production company Milkyway Image with his frequent co-director Wai Ka-Fai.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:40:24.745981+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4420, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_To"}], "uuid": "08ba810f-6253-4637-a87e-01da8e6b6daa", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22596", "external_references": [{"id": 26359, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q470104"}, {"id": 29605, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "85765295"}, {"id": 29606, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2001058584"}, {"id": 29607, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2001058584"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T15:40:32.330346+10:00"}

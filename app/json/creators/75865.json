He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series forming the Life collection, a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth.\nAttenborough was a senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. First becoming prominent as host of Zoo Quest in 1954, his filmography as writer, presenter and narrator has spanned eight decades; it includes Natural World, Wildlife on One, the Planet Earth franchise, The Blue Planet and its sequel. He is the only person to have won BAFTA Awards in black and white, colour, high-definition, 3D and 4K resolution. Over his life he has collected dozens of honorary degrees and awards, including three Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narration.\nWhile Attenborough's earlier work focused more on the wonders of the natural world, his later work has been more vocal in support of environmental causes. He has advocated for restoring planetary biodiversity, limiting population growth, switching to renewable energy, mitigating climate change, reducing meat consumption, and setting aside more areas for natural preservation.\nOn his broadcasting and passion for nature, NPR stated he \"roamed the globe and shared his discoveries and enthusiasms with his patented semi-whisper way of narrating\". He is widely considered a national treasure in the UK, although he himself does not embrace the term. He is the younger brother of director, producer and actor Richard Attenborough, and older brother of motor executive John Attenborough.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:54:26.478584+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5767, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough"}], "uuid": "6eed9e73-334c-4b52-baed-69a5c4f6d7cd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 51684, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q183337"}, {"id": 54266, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "41836007"}, {"id": 54267, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79142715"}, {"id": 54268, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79142715"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:54:30.699109+10:00"}

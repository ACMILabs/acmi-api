He is best known for writing and directing science fiction and horror B-movies such as King Dinosaur (1955), The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Earth vs. the Spider (1958), Village of the Giants (1965), and Empire of the Ants (1977). \nMost of Gordon's work is in the idiom of giant monster films, for which he used rear-projection to create the special effects. He was nicknamed \"Mr. B.I.G.\" by Forrest J Ackerman, a reference to both his initials and his films' tendency to feature super-sized creatures.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:11:59.306521+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3641, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_I._Gordon"}], "uuid": "0e6e931d-573b-4a96-8cc9-6829aaeaf11f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 24901, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q827379"}, {"id": 27492, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "107678701"}, {"id": 27493, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2009179188"}, {"id": 27494, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2009179188"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:11:59.329962+10:00"}

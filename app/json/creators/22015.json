Over six years, he made 11 films for Fox.\nDuring his over 40-year career in Hollywood, Mankiewicz wrote 48 screenplays. He also produced more than 20 films, including The Philadelphia Story (1940) which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Woman of the Year (1942), for which he introduced Katharine Hepburn to Spencer Tracy.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:06:02.174144+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2472, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_L._Mankiewicz"}], "uuid": "34995ba5-a887-4b97-919a-e94de7adb6fc", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22730", "external_references": [{"id": 10565, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q51583"}, {"id": 10566, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "102369298"}, {"id": 10567, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83047932"}, {"id": 10568, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83047932"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T14:00:25.423357+11:00"}

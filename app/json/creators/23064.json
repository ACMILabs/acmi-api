A major figure of Italian art and culture in the mid-20th century, Visconti was one of the fathers of cinematic neorealism, but later moved towards luxurious, sweeping epics dealing with themes of beauty, decadence, death and European history, especially the decay of the nobility and the bourgeoisie. He was the recipient of many accolades, including the Palme d'Or and the Golden Lion, and many of his works are regarded as highly-influential to future generations of filmmakers.Born to a noble Milanese family, Visconti explored artistic proclivities from an early age, working as an assistant director to Jean Renoir. His 1943 directorial debut, Ossessione, was condemned by the Fascist regime for its unvarnished depictions of working-class characters resorting to criminality, but is today renowned as a pioneering work of Italian cinema. His best-known films include Senso (1954) and The Leopard (1963), both historical melodramas based on Italian literary classics, the gritty drama Rocco and His Brothers (1960), and his \"German Trilogy\" – The Damned (1969), Death in Venice (1971) and Ludwig (1972). He was also an accomplished stage director of plays and opera, both in Italy and abroad.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:18:43.342575+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2603, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti"}], "uuid": "8a7b36e6-4e81-4f83-aa3d-6a758f7cd9a6", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24068", "external_references": [{"id": 11125, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q13888"}, {"id": 11126, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "49237034"}, {"id": 11127, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79039716"}, {"id": 11128, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79039716"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:04.575301+10:00"}

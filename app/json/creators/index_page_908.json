With a career spanning five decades, Bergman is often regarded as one of the most influential screen figures in cinematic history. She won numerous accolades, including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, BAFTA Award and a Volpi Cup. She is one of only four actresses to have received at least three acting Academy Awards (only Katharine Hepburn has four). In 1999, the American Film Institute recognised Bergman as the fourth greatest female screen legend of Classic Hollywood Cinema.Born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and a German mother, Bergman began her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to the U.S. audience came in the English-language remake of Intermezzo (1939). Known for her naturally luminous beauty, she starred in Casablanca (1942) as Ilsa Lund. Bergman's notable performances in the 1940s include the dramas For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Joan of Arc (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she won for Gaslight. She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock: Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Under Capricorn (1949).\nIn 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli, released after the revelation that she was having an affair with Rossellini; that and her pregnancy prior to their marriage created a scandal in the U.S. that prompted her to remain in Europe for several years. During this time she starred in Rossellini's Europa '51 and Journey to Italy (1954), the former of which won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress. She returned to Hollywood, earning two more Academy Awards for her roles in Anastasia (1956) and Murder on the Orient Express (1974). During this period she also starred in Indiscreet (1958), Cactus Flower (1969), and Autumn Sonata (1978) receiving her sixth Best Actress nomination.\nBergman won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine (1947). She also won two Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for The Turn of the Screw (1960), and A Woman Called Golda (1982). In 1974, Bergman discovered she was suffering from breast cancer but continued to work until shortly before her death on her sixty-seventh birthday in 1982. Bergman spoke five languages – Swedish, English, German, Italian and French – and acted in each.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:48:51.468721+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4198, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Bergman"}], "uuid": "0116f3a8-72d7-41c2-80b6-69998fe96449", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31910", "external_references": [{"id": 25057, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q43247"}, {"id": 29024, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "68925401"}, {"id": 29025, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50007485"}, {"id": 29026, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50007485"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:48:53.562510+10:00"}, {"id": 76430, "name": "Cary Grant", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475068, "title": "Notorious", "work_id": 79348, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "Archibald Alec Leach", "date_of_birth": "1904-01-18", "date_of_death": "1986-11-29", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 – November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor. He was known for his Mid-Atlantic accent, debonair demeanor, light-hearted approach to acting, and sense of comic timing. He was one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He was nominated twice for the Academy Award, and was honored with Academy Honorary Award in 1970, and the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981. He was named by American Film Institute the second greatest male star of the Golden Age of Hollywood in 1999.Grant was born and brought up in Bristol, England. He became attracted to theater at a young age when he visited the Bristol Hippodrome. At 16, he went as a stage performer with the Pender Troupe for a tour of the US. After a series of successful performances in New York City, he decided to stay there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s.\nGrant initially appeared in crime films and dramas such as Blonde Venus (1932) and She Done Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown for his performances in romantic screwball comedies such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940), and The Philadelphia Story (1940). These pictures are frequently cited among the greatest comedy films of all time. Other well-known films in which he starred in this period were the adventure Gunga Din (1939), the dark comedy Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), and the dramas Only Angels Have Wings (1939), Penny Serenade (1941), and None but the Lonely Heart (1944); he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for the latter two.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Grant had a close working relationship with director Alfred Hitchcock, who cast him in four films: Suspicion (1941), Notorious (1946), To Catch a Thief (1955), and North by Northwest (1959). For the suspense-dramas Suspicion and Notorious, Grant took on darker, morally ambiguous characters, both challenging Grant's screen persona and his acting abilities. Toward the end of his career he starred in the romantic films Indiscreet (1958), That Touch of Mink (1962), and Charade (1963). He is remembered by critics for his unusually broad appeal as a handsome, suave actor who did not take himself too seriously, and able to maintain his dignity in comedies, not sacrificing it entirely.\nGrant was married five times, three of them elopements with actresses Virginia Cherrill (1934–1935), Betsy Drake (1949–1962), and Dyan Cannon (1965–1968). He had daughter Jennifer Grant with Cannon. He retired from film acting in 1966 and pursued numerous business interests, representing cosmetics firm Fabergé and sitting on the board of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  He died of a stroke in 1986 at the age of 82.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:21:45.485850+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3721, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant"}], "uuid": "db41e6f4-4ce8-4da6-a42b-edeeb2b5911f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "33702", "external_references": [{"id": 25096, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q83410"}, {"id": 27713, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117414035"}, {"id": 27714, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50031212"}, {"id": 27715, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50031212"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:21:47.648752+10:00"}, {"id": 76429, "name": "David Stacey", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898888, "title": "Freefall", "work_id": 79328, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "b44b82b7-976d-4a16-8c12-df08ee17d97b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 43219, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121126042"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:02:51.385041+10:00"}, {"id": 76428, "name": "Cathy Palmer", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898886, "title": "Jessye Norman: Singer", "work_id": 79327, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "4d1112af-29ef-4bcb-9432-9189ed53f895", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 35710, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121223171"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:22:58.599298+10:00"}, {"id": 76427, "name": "Kuumba Productions", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 898880, "title": "The Mark of the Hand : Aubrey Williams", "work_id": 79325, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": null, "date_of_death": null, "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": null, "external_links": [], "uuid": "e95159eb-3538-4ba6-bf78-fa96fcbdbedd", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 33245, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121143967"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:12:45.725901+10:00"}, {"id": 76426, "name": "I.

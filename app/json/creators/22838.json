He has been nominated for 15 Academy Awards, including four for Best Actor, four for Best Picture, two for Best Director, three for Original Screenplay, and one for Adapted Screenplay – winning Best Director for Reds (1981). Beatty is the only person to have been nominated for acting in, directing, writing, and producing the same film, and he did so twice: first for Heaven Can Wait (with Buck Henry as co-director), and again with Reds.Eight of the films he has produced have earned 53 Academy nominations, and in 1999, he was awarded the academy's highest honor, the Irving G. Thalberg Award. Beatty has been nominated for 18 Golden Globe Awards, winning six, including the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, with which he was honored in 2007. Among his Golden Globe–nominated films are Splendor in the Grass (1961), his screen debut, and Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Shampoo (1975), Heaven Can Wait, Reds, Dick Tracy (1990), Bugsy (1991), Bulworth (1998), and Rules Don't Apply (2016), all of which he also produced.\nDirector and collaborator Arthur Penn described Beatty as \"the perfect producer\", adding, \"He makes everyone demand the best of themselves. Warren stays with a picture through editing, mixing, and scoring. He plain works harder than anyone else I have ever seen.\" Beatty's films often have a left-leaning political message. Praising Bulworth, Patricia J. Williams said: \"[Beatty] knows power... and this movie is effective precisely because it takes on the issue of power.\"\nWith Bonnie and Clyde, Beatty helped to usher in New Hollywood – a movement in American film history from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, when a new generation of young filmmakers came to prominence in the United States.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T13:21:30.353229+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3280, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty"}], "uuid": "3c21a127-d6cd-4760-9dd3-46c7c300fe39", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30280", "external_references": [{"id": 13876, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q95030"}, {"id": 13877, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "84964967"}, {"id": 13878, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n78029651"}, {"id": 13879, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n78029651"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:33:15.126624+10:00"}

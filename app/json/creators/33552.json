Songs from the Second Floor, more than any other, cemented and exemplified his personal style â€“ which is characterized by long takes, absurdist comedy, stiff caricaturing  of Swedish culture and grotesque. He has spent much of his professional life working on advertisement spots, directing over 400 commercials and two short films; directing six feature-length films in six decades. His 2014 film A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence won the Golden Lion award at 71st Venice International Film Festival, making Andersson the only Swedish director and the second Nordic director to win the award in the history of the festival, after Danish Carl Theodor Dreyer won in 1955. Andersson is considered one of the most important living European film directors, having four films officially submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as Swedish entries.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:56:08+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5085, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Andersson"}], "uuid": "7aa480a9-6fa7-425f-9c22-bc53e9278f67", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28295", "external_references": [{"id": 25827, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q703513"}, {"id": 31326, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "85449282"}, {"id": 31327, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n96106655"}, {"id": 31328, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n96106655"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T15:06:25.862075+10:00"}

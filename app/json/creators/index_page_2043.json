Lucier is well known for her contributions to the form of multi-monitor, multi-channel video installation. In her elegant 'pictorial-narrative' works, in which video images are set within configurations that she describes as 'at once cinematic, sculptural, and theatrical', light and landscape are the essential modes of representation and metaphor.\n\nReinvestigating the American pastoral myth in what she terms 'an ironic dialogue between past and present, mundane and poetic, real and ideal', Lucier questions collective memory and identity through an art historical vocabulary. Echoing paradigmatic motifs of 19th-century painting traditions, her metaphoric use of light to signify transcendence and her allusions to the sublime evoke Romantic and Modernist ideals. Ohio at Giverny (1983) is a poetic homage to Monet's Impressionism; Wilderness (1986) refers to the Luminists and the Hudson River School. In Lucier's works, nature is transformed by culture and technology; luminosity is synonymous with lyricism.\n\nLucier began working in video in the 1970s, after first exploring sculpture, performance and photography. Early works, such as Dawn Burn (1975) and Bird's Eye (1978), are empirical records of the optical effects of light on the camera's eye. Aiming a laser directly at the camera or pointing a lens at the sun, she burned the vidicon tube in real time, inscribing it with calligraphic abstractions of light. In addition to installations, she has also produced video dance works with choreographer Elizabeth Streb, exploring relationships of the human figure, sculptural movement, and landscape.\n\nLucier was born in 1944. She received a B.A. from Brandeis University. Among her many awards are a Guggenheim Fellowship and an American Film Institute Independent Filmmaker Grant, as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. She has been artist-in-residence at the Capp Street Project, San Francisco, and the Television Laboratory at WNET/Thirteen, New York; and has taught at New York University, the San Francisco Art Institute, the Cleveland Institute of Art, Minnesota College of Art and Design, and the School of Visual Arts, New York. Lucier has had solo exhibitions at The Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; Capp Street Project, San Francisco; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Dallas Museum of Art; Madison Art Center, Wisconsin, and Greenburg-Wilson Gallery. Her work has also been exhibited in group shows at festivals and institutions including the American Film Institute National Video Festival, Los Angeles; Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition, New York; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Artspace, Sydney; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Lucier was selected as 'One of the ten artists to watch in the '90s' by ARTnews magazine.

Capturing the essence of subjects that range from avant-garde artists to New England fishermen, her video portraits are minimalist dramas -- precisely composed, richly nuanced, and highly expressive of the character of the \"sitter.\"\n\nIn 1980, Logue began the 30 Second Spots, an innovative series of video portraits that she terms \"commercials for artists.\" These succinct \"spots\" use the format, style, and condensed timeframe of television advertising to present unconventional portraits of vanguard artists, musicians, writers, and performers. Each subject performs a concise gesture or action in close-up before a stationary camera; Logue heightens this intimate theater with a precise application of electronic effects.\n\nProducing portraits in cities around the world, she has collaborated with such well-known figures as Laurie Anderson, David Hockney, Philip Glass, and Jacques Derrida. Logue's first video portraits, begun in 1972, were silent, extended examinations of the faces of friends, family, and neighbors. Eloquently reinterpreting the photographic portrait for a time-based medium, Logue's video project extends her earlier work as a portrait and still photographer.\n\nLogue was born in 1942. She trained as a painter and photographer, receiving a B.F.A. and an M.A. from St. Mary's College in Los Angeles. Logue, who was one of the founders of the video program at the American Film Institute, has also taught at California Institute of the Arts, UCLA, and Otis/Parsons. She has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the French Ministry of Culture, the Massachusetts Council on the Arts and Humanities, the Guggenheim Foundation, and the New York State Council on the Arts. Her works have been widely broadcast and exhibited at institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; The Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; International Center of Photography, New York; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; Videonale Bonn; and Second Bank of the United States (Portrait Gallery), Philadelphia.

Through metaphor, provocation and association, Kobland often explores the historical meaning, critical context, and received notions of a particular site or place. He writes, \"I 'dream' a place .... The work is principally about reflecting on the meaning of a site; historically, psychically, and physically. It?s about the saturation of place. The place in our heads and the place on the ground.\" Kobland is currently working on a new film/video work, Who Writes Remains, and a collaborative feature film project with The Wooster Group.\n\nKen Kobland was born in New York in 1946. He studied at Columbia University School of Architecture and Union College. Since 1975 he has worked with the Wooster Group. Kobland has received awards and fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; the New York Foundation on the Arts; the D.A.A.D. Berliner Kunstprogramm; the International Center for Video Creation in Montbeliard, France; the Jerome Foundation; and the American Film Institute. His work has been included in film and video festivals in Geneva, Berlin, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Sydney, Budapest, Warsaw, Tokyo, and Bangkok, and has been screened at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Biennial; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and the Arsenal, Berlin. Kobland?s work has also been screened nationally on Public Television and in Europe.

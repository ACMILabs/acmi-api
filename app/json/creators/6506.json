Originally trained as a painter, his work since the mid 'eighties has focused on combining time-based art forms such as video, sound and computer animation with static objects and images to create a vivid environment. Haines' work draws on pre-Rationalist magic to be found in the written word, when symbols were seen to be as powerful as the things they represented, from alchemical emblems to heraldry. Something of this is returned to signs in the age of 3D animation and graphics terminal design. For Haines, humour is a tool of disruption. Haines explores the underbelly of language, replete with bizarre hybridisations and deliberate misspellings. Medievalism-musical/non musical kingdoms was a major video work of 1997 involving multi video monitors and projections shown at Artspace, Sydney. For the collection of works Avatar at the Physics room, Haines had taken an assemblage approach to present a series of works that are hallucinatory, intense and playful, along with the text of some incongruous ideas.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:27:47.722849+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c07db939-9056-4ec9-a82e-df8d64e8e54a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110110", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:27:47.723123+11:00"}

A lifetime member of the Actors Studio, he won several Emmys, was the first male actor to win the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor twice, and was nominated for two Academy Awards.He established himself as a leading man in Hollywood with critically acclaimed performances as Mio Romagna in Winterset (1936), George Milton in Of Mice and Men (1939), and Ernie Pyle in The Story of G.I. Joe (1945).\nMeredith was known later in his career for his appearances on The Twilight Zone and for portraying The Penguin in the 1960s TV series Batman and boxing trainer Mickey Goldmill in the Rocky film series. For his performances in The Day of the Locust (1975) and Rocky (1976), he received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He later appeared in the comedy Foul Play (1978) and the fantasy film Clash of the Titans (1981). He narrated numerous films and documentaries during his long career.\"Although those performances renewed his popularity,\" observed Mel Gussow in The New York Times (referring to Penguin and Mickey Goldmill), \"they represented only a small part of a richly varied career in which he played many of the more demanding roles in classical and contemporary theater—in plays by Shakespeare, O'Neill, Beckett and others.\"", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:18:26.016118+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3699, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Meredith"}], "uuid": "d5d4135b-255a-45ef-9426-83cef9c1fd98", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "16379", "external_references": [{"id": 25733, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q343633"}, {"id": 27650, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "94475045"}, {"id": 27651, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81074396"}, {"id": 27652, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81074396"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T10:35:54.084521+10:00"}

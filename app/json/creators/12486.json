After a stint creating training films for the Victorian Post Office film unit and at the ABC – where she worked on the Olympic Games coverage in 1956 – she established an independent film production company with her husband, cinematographer Adrian Boddington. With an interest in socially conscious themes, Zanthus Films created documentaries commissioned by government departments and the Anti-Cancer Council, including Three in a Million (1959), Port of Melbourne (1961) and You Are Not Alone (1961). After the death of her husband in 1970, Boddington retired from film production and in 1972 was appointed the first full-time curator of photography at the National Gallery of Victoria, where she gave exhibitions to leading women artists Micky Allan, Ruth Maddison and Carol Jerrems.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-31T22:36:05.551177+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "364f4aca-fcd1-4aa0-8612-054534a6d576", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21695", "external_references": [{"id": 36430, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121057961"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-31T22:36:05.551491+11:00"}

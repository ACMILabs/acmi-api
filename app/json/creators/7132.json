He has since produced several installations including Encyclopaedia Chiaroscuro (1987), Portrait One (1990), Family Portrait (1993), Landscape One (1997), Passages (1998) and Rendezvous (1999). He has had a solo show at Museum of Modern Art in New York. These experiments with conversational interfaces have been elaborated to give the impression of communication between visitors and virtual beings. The video sequences are stored on laser-disc and displayed as reflections on a glass plate positioned directly above the video projection. Of late, Courchesne has tried to make a more closed sense of space, and to create a better sense of immersion. His latest work is with interactive devices set in a single-channel panoramic viewer, Panoscope 360, a doughnut-shaped anamorphic video, which gives a seamless image and uses voice for input. 'In expanding the field of view', writes Courchesne, 'immersive imaging frees the viewer's body and multiplies the possible points of view, [...] transforming spectators into visitors.'", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T23:27:12.222437+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3a4a72a1-9693-40b5-a841-204c820ae163", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110736", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T23:27:12.222784+11:00"}

Since June 2001, the network has shifted its focus to dramatic television series and feature films, along with some sporting events (including NBA, NHL, U.S. Soccer, the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and professional wrestling shows AEW Rampage and AEW Collision), as TBS shifted its focus to comedic programming.\nAs of September 2018, TNT was received by approximately 89.573 million households that subscribe to a subscription television service throughout the United States.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:59:55.648886+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6233, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)"}], "uuid": "78bdbfcf-6194-421c-a2bb-15e21a940e8c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "13754", "external_references": [{"id": 36461, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q688333"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:59:55.670522+10:00"}

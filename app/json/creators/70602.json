The family got two sons and stayed there until 1861, establishing three photographic businesses. Back in England, York started a business in London, in 1863, and soon built up an international reputation for the high quality of his magic lantern slides, being his favourite side of the business. His son William joined him in 1877. By the 1890s the production of York & Son exceeded 100,000 slides per year and by 1900 even more than 140,000.\n\nSlides from 1890 are identifiable by their trade mark, a ‘Y’ with a snake entwined, set in a triangle. Their catalogues covered every subject, like Travel, Comic, Science, Education and Life Model series, which were produced with particular dedication. Their resident scenic painter and stage manager E. T. Green provided the very elaborate backdrops.\n\nAfter Frederick’s death in 1903, his son carried on as a manager, but due to the waning popularity of the magic lantern the business formally dissolved in 1907. Later on the company was taken over by Newton & Co. The new owner closed the existing premises and opened York House in South Kensington. New slides were produced, but also the complete back catalogue of York & Sons was still available. Production continued until the late 1940s.\n\nYORK, FREDERICK\nFounder of York & Son.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-19T22:40:50.320067+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "c10db352-3247-4bc8-ae65-151cfd59176a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39337", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-19T22:40:50.320287+11:00"}

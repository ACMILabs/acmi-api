His work uses found objects, tech and the manufactured items of modern life to create absurdist sculptures and installations, and is designed to challenge the way we interact with ourselves and technology.\n\nArnot has exhibited across Australia, UK, Germany, Belgium, Italy, China, Russia, and New Zealand. His work has increasingly incorporated video, documentary, performance and experimental media as a means for understanding how technology mediates our relationship with the natural world.\n\nArnot's work addresses the role of automation and simulation, often looking at robotic and less-sentient substitutes for humans and human interactions. Many of his projects investigate innovations in plant robotics, as well as emergent research into plant communication and consciousness.\n\nImage credit: Jacquie Manning; 08/08/2023", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-11T12:14:21.392959+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "1f2055ae-74f3-41c5-891c-6619ddb9812a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39491", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-11T12:14:21.393294+11:00"}

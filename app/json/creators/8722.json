He is one of the principal originators of what is commonly known as the body horror genre, with his films exploring visceral bodily transformation, infection, technology, and the intertwining of the psychological with the physical. Cronenberg is best known for exploring these themes through sci-fi horror films such as Shivers (1975), Scanners (1981),  Videodrome (1983), and The Fly (1986), though he has also worked in multiple genres throughout his career.Cronenberg's films have polarized critics and audiences alike; he has earned critical acclaim and has sparked controversy for his depictions of gore and violence. The Village Voice called him \"the most audacious and challenging narrative director in the English-speaking world\". His films have won numerous awards, including, for Crash, the Special Jury Prize at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, a unique award that is distinct from the Jury Prize as it is not given annually, but only at the request of the official jury, who in this case gave the award \"for originality, for daring, and for audacity\".In the 2000s and 2010s, Cronenberg collaborated on several films with Viggo Mortensen, including A History of Violence (2005), Eastern Promises (2007), and A Dangerous Method (2011). He competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival with Cosmopolis.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T11:12:26.145970+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 1881, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cronenberg"}], "uuid": "f07e0f3e-0cd2-422e-b6ff-31b10a92891d", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "414", "external_references": [{"id": 8173, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55422"}, {"id": 8174, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "97752099"}, {"id": 8175, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83327625"}, {"id": 8176, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83327625"}], "date_modified": "2025-08-20T15:08:29.907959+10:00"}

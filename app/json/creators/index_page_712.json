"united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 –January 15, 1994), sometimes credited as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who reached the peak of his success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours.Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family's poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists, such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP Pandemonium Shadow Show, followed by a variety of releases that included a collaboration with Randy Newman (Nilsson Sings Newman, 1970) and the original children's story The Point! (1971). He created the first remix album (Aerial Pandemonium Ballet, 1971) and recorded the first mashup song ( \"You Can't Do That\", 1967). His most commercially successful album, Nilsson Schmilsson (1971), produced the international top 10 singles \"Without You\" and \"Coconut\". His other top 10 hit, \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (1968), was featured prominently in the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy. A version of Nilsson's \"One\", released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.During a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered \"Nilsson\". Sometimes called \"the American Beatle\", he soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr, joining them in the Hollywood Vampires drinking club. He and Lennon produced one collaborative album, Pussy Cats (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon's 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, Losst and Founnd (2019).\nThe craft of Nilsson's songs and the defiant attitude he projected remain touchstones for later generations of indie rock musicians. Nilsson was voted No. 62 in Rolling Stone's 2015 list of the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\", where he was described as \"a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound\" and \"a crucial bridge\" between 1960s psychedelia and the 1970s singer-songwriter era. The RIAA certified Nilsson Schmilsson and Son of Schmilsson (1972) as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. He earned two Grammy Awards (for \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and \"Without You\").\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T20:31:23.638067+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2203, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nilsson"}], "uuid": "a5494100-c3aa-4af8-a4af-5060761476dc", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20337", "external_references": [{"id": 9475, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q281034"}, {"id": 9476, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "115794039"}, {"id": 9477, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n91127356"}, {"id": 9478, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n91127356"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:31:24.251680+10:00"}, {"id": 78390, "name": "Larry Gordon", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475938, "title": "The Point", "work_id": 87026, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1945", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-17T15:14:36.226272+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "8f8a8c90-8dfc-4d6b-a058-51497f4ae2eb", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23481", "external_references": [{"id": 33103, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121126192"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T22:14:07.693494+10:00"}, {"id": 78389, "name": "Jerry Good", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475937, "title": "The Point", "work_id": 87026, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [], "biography": "", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-08-17T15:14:35.608777+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "5f8f14e9-e967-4ee2-886a-82292b4f6463", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21794", "external_references": [{"id": 33005, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q121079360"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T21:22:42.408895+10:00"}, {"id": 78388, "name": "Jack Sher", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2326118, "title": "The 3 worlds of Gulliver", "work_id": 87022, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "John Jacob Sher", "date_of_birth": "1913-03-16", "date_of_death": "1988-08-23", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "John Jacob Sher (16 March 1913 – 23 August 1988) was an American newspaper columnist, songwriter, film director, film writer, and producer.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T15:18:17.516894+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 4226, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sher"}], "uuid": "c78bfb7a-5b6f-4cd8-9f50-81d4a29b2927", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21092", "external_references": [{"id": 26316, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1677204"}, {"id": 29095, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "46947615"}, {"id": 29096, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "no2002101034"}, {"id": 29097, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-no2002101034"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T20:56:59.295671+10:00"}, {"id": 78387, "name": "Ringo Starr", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 1991346, "title": "Magical mystery tour", "work_id": 86997, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 907121, "title": "Magical mystery tour", "work_id": 87751, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Richard Henry Parkin Starkey-Graves, Jr.", "date_of_birth": "1940-07-07", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "biography": "Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter and actor who achieved international fame as the drummer for the Beatles. Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of four others. \nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship as a machinist at a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, Starr became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. \nIn addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". His most successful UK single was \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. Starr has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television program Thomas & Friends and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\nStarr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' \"Rain\". In 1999, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015, and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music. In 2020, he was cited as the wealthiest drummer in the world, with a net worth of $350 million.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T00:35:48.640469+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6136, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr"}], "uuid": "432dd0fc-2d06-4892-aa0a-5b810c616a10", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 37253, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2632"}, {"id": 55653, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "117667596"}, {"id": 55654, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81041846"}, {"id": 55655, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81041846"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T00:35:51.457656+10:00"}]}

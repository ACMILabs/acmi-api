Fuller wrote his first screenplay for Hats Off in 1936, and made his directorial debut with the Western I Shot Jesse James (1949). He would continue to direct several other Westerns and war thrillers throughout the 1950s.\nFuller shifted from Westerns and war movies in the 1960s with his low-budget thriller Shock Corridor in 1963, followed by the neo-noir The Naked Kiss (1964). He was inactive in filmmaking for most of the 1970s, before writing and directing the semi-autobiographical war epic The Big Red One (1980), and the drama White Dog (1982), whose screenplay he co-wrote with Curtis Hanson. Several of his films would prove influential to French New Wave filmmakers, notably Jean-Luc Godard, who gave him a cameo appearance in Pierrot le Fou (1965).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T16:59:17.563182+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3060, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Fuller"}], "uuid": "346a972d-d8ab-400e-9b0f-2ba4a68e73d9", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28515", "external_references": [{"id": 12992, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q262479"}, {"id": 12993, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "96709995"}, {"id": 12994, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50016670"}, {"id": 12995, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50016670"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T12:22:13.454556+10:00"}

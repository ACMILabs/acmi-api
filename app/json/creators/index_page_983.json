He subsequently produced the series Survivors (1975—1977), also directing one episode, and wrote the script for the season three premiere episode, \"Manhunt\". His young son, Stephen, had a regular part in Doomwatch. Dudley also directed eight early episodes of All Creatures Great and Small, including the 1983 Christmas special.\nHe began an association with Doctor Who when he directed Meglos (1980) for John Nathan-Turner. That same year, he was asked to become producer of Blake's 7 after David Maloney was reassigned before it was known that a fourth season would be made. Dudley turned the offer down, as he no longer wished to work as a producer. The following year he embarked on a brief career as a screenwriter for Doctor Who. He wrote three scripts for the programme—Four to Doomsday (1982), Black Orchid (1982) and The King's Demons (1983). He novelised the latter two stories for Target Books. He also wrote the script of K-9 and Company (1981), the one-off drama starring Elisabeth Sladen which was intended as a pilot for a spin-off series involving Sarah Jane Smith and the robot dog K9.\nDudley died after a long period of cancer on Christmas Day 1988.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-06T01:44:50.075576+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6214, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Dudley"}], "uuid": "29c87445-b3c1-4d98-9478-40bfb9fa5f11", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29556", "external_references": [{"id": 51845, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7701892"}, {"id": 55942, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "14606940"}, {"id": 55943, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "nr00006507"}, {"id": 55944, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-nr00006507"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-06T01:44:50.094166+10:00"}, {"id": 75684, "name": "Joan Root", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2133749, "title": "Castles of clay", "work_id": 76006, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1936-03-25", "date_of_death": "2006-01-13", "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 174, "name": "Kenya", "slug": "kenya"}], "biography": "Joan Root (18 January 1936 – 13 January 2006) was a Kenyan conservationist, ecological activist and Oscar-nominated filmmaker.\n With her film-maker husband, Alan Root she made a series of acclaimed wildlife films.

As a conductor, he championed the music of lesser-known composers. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest film composers. Alex Ross writes that \"Over four decades, he revolutionized movie scoring by abandoning the illustrative musical techniques that dominated Hollywood in the 1930s and imposing his own peculiar harmonic and rhythmic vocabulary.\"An Academy Award-winner for The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941), Herrmann is known for his collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock, notably The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) (where he makes a cameo as the conductor at Royal Albert Hall), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963) (as \"sound consultant\") and Marnie (1964). He worked in radio drama, composing for Orson Welles's The Mercury Theater on the Air, and his first film score was for Welles's film debut, Citizen Kane (1941). His other credits include Jane Eyre (1943), Anna and the King of Siam (1946), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), Cape Fear (1962), Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and Twisted Nerve (1968). Herrmann scored films that were inspired by Hitchcock, like François Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968) and Brian De Palma's Sisters (1972) and Obsession (1976). He composed the scores for several fantasy films by Ray Harryhausen, and composed for television, including Have Gun – Will Travel and Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone. His last score, recorded shortly before his death, was for Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976).", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:11:11.981451+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3634, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann"}], "uuid": "7e53d532-e810-473b-b8d0-901e544f4984", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34044", "external_references": [{"id": 25166, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q296804"}, {"id": 27472, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "12491561"}, {"id": 27473, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81035338"}, {"id": 27474, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81035338"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T17:59:12.341284+10:00"}, {"id": 75679, "name": "Gregg Toland", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2475883, "title": "Intermezzo", "work_id": 85624, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1988471, "title": "The Little foxes", "work_id": 84620, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2138495, "title": "Citizen Kane (TEFC)", "work_id": 75988, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2138481, "title": "Citizen Kane", "work_id": 79537, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2293111, "title": "These three", "work_id": 85357, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2351958, "title": "The Grapes of Wrath", "work_id": 80788, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2107178, "title": "Ball of fire", "work_id": 84667, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2305563, "title": "Song of the south", "work_id": 89350, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 802949, "title": "Nana", "work_id": 89523, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2475694, "title": "Wuthering Heights", "work_id": 80109, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1904-05-29", "date_of_death": "1948-09-28", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Gregg Wesley Toland, A.S.C.

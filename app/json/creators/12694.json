Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.\nThe function of film, Deren believed, was to create an experience. She combined her expertise in dance and choreography, ethnography, the African spirit religion of Haitian Vodou,  symbolist poetry and gestalt psychology (student of Kurt Koffka)  in a series of perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump-cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her advantage, Deren abandoned established notions of physical space and time, in carefully planned films with specific conceptual aims.Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), her collaboration with Alexander Hammid, has been one of the most influential experimental films in American cinema history. She went on to make several films of her own, including At Land (1944), A Study in Choreography for Camera (1945), and Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2022-05-19T12:26:46.564289+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 2687, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Deren"}], "uuid": "8d2a354c-fa0f-4f5b-a748-ac5ec438e29a", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24893", "external_references": [{"id": 11467, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q450382"}, {"id": 11468, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "59193774"}, {"id": 11469, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n83179417"}, {"id": 11470, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n83179417"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-13T12:31:21.637776+10:00"}

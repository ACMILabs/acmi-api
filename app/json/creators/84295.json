His two younger brothers were Sydney (b. Wigan, 1906) and Albert (b. Sydney, Australia, 1915)\nWilliam senior, his wife Annie and the two older boys emigrated as a family by steamship from England to Australia (Sydney) in 1911.\nIn due course William junior became a plasterer, residing initially in Sydney, before moving to Bulawayo, Rhodesia in the mid to late 1930’s. During World War 2 he served in the Southern Rhodesia Forces for 6 years (1940 to 1946) in a medical corp, travelling to various wartime conflict zones, including Middle East, Egypt and Cyprus. He also spent time in England, perhaps after the war, before returning to Bulawayo in 1950.\nOutside of wartime service he undertook his vocational trade as a plasterer, which financed his extensive travels throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. In the early 1960’s he purchased an 8 mm movie camera and documented his travels using the same, the product of which is the fourteen film reels he left as a legacy of these travels.\nWilliam remained a bachelor his whole life and lived out his later years in Melbourne, where he experienced poor health and died with related complications on the 12th October 1979. He had requested his body be donated to medical science and this was duly undertaken, with his internment by the University of Melbourne in Eltham Cemetery taking place on the 20th November 1981.\n- Nephew, Andrew Darbyshire (2017) Donor.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2023-05-09T11:19:06.464024+10:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "521ca91c-09be-41ae-92d0-c54c834fa9c8", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38899", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2023-06-14T16:33:30.576250+10:00"}

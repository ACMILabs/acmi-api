During the past ten years, he has combined computer animation, generative systems, multimedia design and interactivity to create virtual worlds. These worlds are a means of collecting together objects, characters and icons that are influenced by video games, electronic music, and digital aesthetics. In his work, Innocent explores the dynamic between the iconic ideal and the personal specific, the real and the simulated, and the way in which our identity is shaped by our language and communication.\n\nIn 1991 Innocent completed his Graduate Diploma of Art in Graphic Design at Swinburne University, and a Post Graduate Diploma of Animation and Interactive Multimedia the following year. During the early 90多s he collaboratively produced a number of installation and video works as Cyberdada. In 1994, Idea-ON>!, a CD-ROM exploring the nature of electronic space was exhibited at Siggraph and ISEA. PsyVision, a 50 minute computer animation, was completed in 1996. This work developed a visual language of iconic figuration and synthetic abstraction that had a synaesthetic relationship with it多s electronic soundtrack.\n\nIconica, first exhibited at Siggraph in 1998, is an interactive installation that an artificial world made of language. The icons of this language relate to unique pictorial styles and soundscapes used to represent the world, and may be combined using grammatical rules to create new meanings. These icons form the basis an artificial life model which determines the behaviour and evolution of the world. The work explores the multiplicity of electronic space: simultaneously a cyberspace, a mindspace, an abstract world and a stylised reality.\n\nInnocent is currently Senior Lecturer in the Department of Design at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, and is producing Evolglyph, an interactive virtual world that generates iconic forms. This work has been commissioned by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image at Federation Square. He is also undertaking a Master of Arts investigating a model for digital media language.", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-04-03T20:35:00.614146+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "ede9eb04-e680-4205-9f3f-97f5129be04c", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110735", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-04-03T20:35:00.614394+11:00"}

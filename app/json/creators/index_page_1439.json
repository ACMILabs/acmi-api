After seven years of entertainment industry experience in Japan and Taiwan, Peter Loehr established Imar Film Co., Ltd., China's first independent film company, in 1995. Imar was China's first true, multi-faceted independent film company, producing, distributing and marketing all of their films entirely in-house. Loehr was selected as one of Variety's \"10 Producers to Watch\" in 1999.\nLoehr has produced nine feature films in Asia, including: \"Spicy Love Soup\", which swept the 1998 domestic Chinese awards; \"Shower\" (1999), which won 11 awards at nine different film festivals, including Toronto, San Sebastian, Thessaloniki, Rotterdam, Udine and Seattle, and \"Quitting\" (2001), which won awards at the Bangkok, Singapore and Stockholm Film Festivals. All five Imar produced films were among the top domestic releases in China the year they were released.\nIn early 2002, Loehr began a new venture, Ming Productions, focusing on larger scale Asian-themed pictures for a world audience. His sixth film, \"Sunflower\" (directed by Zhang Yang, starring Sun Haiying and Joan Chen) won Best Director and Best Cinematography awards at the 2005 San Sebastian Film Festival. Loehr's seventh film, \"One Last Dance\" (Directed by Max Makowski, starring Francis Ng, Ti Lung and Harvey Keitel) attended the Sundance Film Festival in the World Dramatic Competition. In 2005, Loehr was a producer on \"Jade Warrior\", a Finnish/Dutch/Estonian Co-Production that premiered at the 2006 Toronto Film Festival and had number one opening weekends at both the Chinese and Finnish box offices.  In 2007, Loehr was a producer on \"The Children of Huang Shi\", a German/Australian/Chinese Co-Production directed by Roger Spottiswoode and starring Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Radha Mitchell, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh. The film was released world-wide in 2008.\nIn January 2005, Peter Loehr became Managing Director of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in China, China's largest and most successful literary and talent agency. During Loehr's seven-year tenure leading CAA in Asia, the agency grew from the ground up to represent over seventy artists in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. In six short years, CAA was involved with four of the largest co-productions in Asian history, John Woo's \"Red Cliff\", Rob Minkoff's \"The Forbidden Kingdom\", \"Mission: Impossible III\" and the Will Smith produced \"The Karate Kid\". In 2009, CAA directors directed 5 of the top 8 films at the Chinese box office. CAA directors and actors have won countless awards, including the Golden horse for best Actor (Huang Bo) and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival (Wang Quanan). CAA talent, including Yang Lan, Daniel Wu and Karen Mok, have served as spokespeople for many of Asia's largest brands.In April 2012, Peter Loehr joined Legendary Pictures and became CEO of its China joint venture - Legendary East, a film company focusing on big budget Sino-US Co-productions with subjects based on Chinese history, mythology, or culture. He was one of the producers of The Great Wall, directed by Zhang Yimou, and starring Matt Damon, Willem Dafoe, Pedro Pascal and Andy Lau.

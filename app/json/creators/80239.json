He quickly rose to prominence in the Turkish film industry. Many of his works were devoted to the plight of ordinary working-class people in Turkey. Güney won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1982 for the film Yol (The Road) which he co-produced with Şerif Gören. He was at constant odds with the Turkish government over the portrayal of Kurdish culture, people and language in his movies.\n\nAfter being convicted of killing judge Sefa Mutlu in 1974 (a charge which he denied), Güney fled the country and was later stripped of his citizenship. A year before his death in 1983, he co-founded the Kurdish Institute of Paris together with the Kurdish poets Cegerxwîn and Hejar among others.; 17/08/2023", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-05T14:15:15.628717+11:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3313, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%B1lmaz_G%C3%BCney"}], "uuid": "7df52223-3c66-4cb0-8ae0-7e3f5753f2ad", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30586", "external_references": [{"id": 14013, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q126693"}, {"id": 14014, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "9998056"}, {"id": 14015, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n87882211"}, {"id": 14016, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n87882211"}], "date_modified": "2025-03-05T14:15:15.628976+11:00"}

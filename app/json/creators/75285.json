Shebib is a central figure in the development of English Canadian cinema who made several short documentaries for the National Film Board of Canada and CBC Television in the 1960s before turning to feature films, beginning with the influential Goin' Down the Road (1970) and what many call his masterpiece, Between Friends (1973). He soon became frustrated by the bureaucratic process of film funding in Canada and chronic problems with distribution as well as a string of box office disappointments. After Heartaches (1981), he made fewer films for theatrical release and worked more in television.\nShebib is Noah \"40\" Shebib's father.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:41:58.809147+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3907, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Shebib"}], "uuid": "a3924994-150d-4828-9077-1b10ea836bb3", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18313", "external_references": [{"id": 26600, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1240358"}, {"id": 28236, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "501149196275174790764"}, {"id": 28237, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79015270"}, {"id": 28238, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79015270"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-15T10:49:37.059026+10:00"}

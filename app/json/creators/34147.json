He is regarded as one of cinema's most influential filmmakers for his work in the silent era.An erudite child with an early interest in film, Murnau eventually studied philology and art before director Max Reinhardt recruited him to his acting school. During World War I he served in the Imperial German Army, initially as an  infantry company commander and later with the German Army's Flying Corps as an observer/gunner. He survived several crashes without any severe injuries.Murnau first directorial work premiered in 1919, but he did not attain international recognition until the 1922 film Nosferatu, an adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Although not a commercial success owing to copyright issues with author Stoker's estate, the film is considered a masterpiece of German Expressionist cinema and an early cult film. Murnau later directed the film The Last Laugh (1924), as well as a 1926 interpretation of Goethe's Faust. He emigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made three films: Sunrise (1927), 4 Devils (1928) and City Girl (1930). Sunrise has been regarded by critics and film directors as among the best films ever made.Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to make the film Tabu (1931) with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty, although disputes with Flaherty led Murnau to finish the film on his own. A week before the successful opening of Tabu, Murnau died in a California hospital from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Of the 21 films Murnau directed, eight are now considered to be completely lost. One reel of his feature Marizza, genannt die Schmuggler-Madonna survives. This leaves only 12 films surviving in their entirety.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T19:54:22.574576+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5826, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Murnau"}], "uuid": "9e2e034a-6d5a-4292-b900-eeee43b65b77", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18955", "external_references": [{"id": 35161, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q55412"}, {"id": 54480, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "12312928"}, {"id": 54481, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n81053559"}, {"id": 54482, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n81053559"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T19:54:26.653205+10:00"}

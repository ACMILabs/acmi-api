Sarkisian; May 20, 1946) is an American singer, actress and television personality. Often referred to by the media as the \"Goddess of Pop\", she has been described as embodying female autonomy in a male-dominated industry. Known for her distinctive contralto singing voice and for having worked in numerous areas of entertainment, as well as adopting a variety of styles and appearances; Cher rose to fame in 1965 as one half of the folk rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher, before launching a successful, six-decade-long solo career.\nShortly after her success with Sonny Bono, Cher released her first solo top-ten singles \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\" and \"You Better Sit Down Kids\". Throughout the 1970s, she scored the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\", and \"Dark Lady\", becoming the female solo artist with the most number-one singles in US history at the time. After her divorce from Bono in 1975, Cher released the successful disco album Take Me Home (1979). Her music career revival in 1987 saw the releases of rock-inflected albums Cher (1987), Heart of Stone (1989), and Love Hurts (1991), all of which yielded hit singles such as \"I Found Someone\", \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", and \"Love and Understanding\". Cher reached a new commercial peak in 1998 with the dance-pop album Believe, which featured pioneering use of Auto-Tune to distort her vocals, known as the \"Cher effect\". The title track became the number-one song of 1999 in the US and the biggest-selling single of all time by a female artist in the UK. She continued to make music, with the albums Closer to the Truth (2013) and Dancing Queen (2018) both debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 and becoming her highest-charting solo albums in the US.\nCher became a television personality in the 1970s with her CBS shows ― The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, watched by over 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, and the namesake Cher. In 1982, she made her Broadway debut in the play Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean and starred in its film adaptation. Cher subsequently garnered critical acclaim for her performances in films such as Silkwood (1983), Mask (1985), The Witches of Eastwick (1987), and Moonstruck (1987), the last of which won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. She contributed to the soundtrack for her next film, Mermaids (1990), which spawned the UK number-one single \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\", and made her directorial debut with a segment in the abortion-themed anthology If These Walls Could Talk (1996). During the 2010s, Cher landed starring roles in the films Burlesque (2010) and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018).\nHaving sold 100 million records, Cher is one of the world's best-selling music artists. Her achievements include a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, an Academy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival award, the Billboard Icon Award, and awards from the Kennedy Center Honors and the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She is the only artist to date to have a number-one single on a Billboard chart in six consecutive decades, from the 1960s to the 2010s. Her 2002–2005 Living Proof: The Farewell Tour became one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time, earning $250 million. Aside from music and acting, she is noted for her trendsetting, elaborate outfits, plastic surgeries, political views, social media presence, philanthropic endeavors, and social activism, including LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS prevention.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T18:30:15.606135+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 5745, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher"}], "uuid": "1dedf9ba-4e25-4645-ae11-1c2486a4508b", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 51551, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q12003"}, {"id": 54195, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "101870495"}, {"id": 54196, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n50038010"}, {"id": 54197, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n50038010"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T18:30:22.386592+10:00"}, {"id": 80714, "name": "Nancy Savoca", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 928807, "title": "If these walls could talk", "work_id": 94278, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1959-07-23", "date_of_death": null, "genders": [{"id": 5, "name": "Female", "slug": "female"}], "languages": [], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "Nancy Laura Savoca (born July 23, 1959) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter.\n\n", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-09-05T23:24:41.750569+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 6057, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Savoca"}], "uuid": "599578cf-dbb5-4581-834a-e3e8ba07602f", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": null, "external_references": [{"id": 52084, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3335603"}, {"id": 55334, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "64207523"}, {"id": 55335, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n85080254"}, {"id": 55336, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n85080254"}], "date_modified": "2023-09-05T23:24:41.771556+10:00"}, {"id": 80713, "name": "James Woods", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2097846, "title": "Another day in paradise", "work_id": 94265, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "", "date_of_birth": "1947-04-18", "date_of_death": "", "genders": [{"id": 9, "name": "Male", "slug": "male"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "English", "slug": "english"}], "places_of_operation": [{"id": 1, "name": "United States of America", "slug": "united-states-of-america"}], "biography": "James Howard Woods (born April 18, 1947) is an American actor.

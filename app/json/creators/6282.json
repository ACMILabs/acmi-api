Rendered with wit and ingenuity, Baldino's ironic performance tapes question the function and meaning of everyday objects and actions.\n\nLow-tech and straightforward, her works often document the artist in the process of assembling found objects, taking them apart, reconstructing them, or transforming their function. These minimalist vignettes, shot with a static camera and often performed in real time, exhibit an anecdotal conceptual humor and an implied, though elusive, narrativity. Typically, Baldino's actions result in oppositions, contradictions or incongruities; she reveals ironic gaps between her deconstructed objects and the meanings or functions assigned to them.\n\nBaldino's pieces are often seeded with wry references to gender and role-playing, which takes the form of ironic costuming and performance. Her witty inquiries into the meaning and perception of objects and gestures are often informed by scientific or philosophical principles. Baldino's video works are most often incorporated within an expanded context of installation, objects, or projections.\n\nPhyllis Baldino was born in 1956. She earned a B.F.A. from Hartford Art School, Connecticut. She has had one-person shows at Tate, Thomas Nordenstad Gallery and Lauren Wittels, New York; and Southern Exposure Gallery, San Francisco. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Impakt Festival, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; The Guggenheim Museum Soho, New York; Air de Paris, Nice; Four Walls, New York; Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies; and Independent Art Space, London. Baldino has screened her work at the New York International Video Festival and the 1st Video Festival del Meditteraneo. She lives in New York.\n\n\nThe \"Gray Area\" Series: Program 1, 1993, 27:14 min, color, sound\nCosmetic/Not Cosmetic\nClock/Not Clock\nLounge/Not Lounge\nVacuum/Not Vacuum\nThe \"Gray Area\" Series: Program 2, 1993, 25:55 min, color, sound\n60s Dress/Object\nThe \"Gray Area\" Series: Program 3, 1993, 27:32 min, color, sound\nSpeaker/Not Speaker\nTape Case/Not Tape Case\nCheese Board/Not Cheese Board\nBriefcase/Not Briefcase\nCoffee Table/Not Coffee Table\nWine Rack/Not Wine Rack\nPlant Holder/Not Plant Holder\nLamp/Not Lamp\nTrav-l-bar/Not Trav-l-bar\nSuitcase/Not Suitcase\nVenice in Berlin in Venice, 1993, 5:56 min, color, sound\nSame Shoes, 1994, 14:26 min, color, sound\nThe \"Gray Area\" Series: Program 4, 1994, 23:00 min, color, sound\nPopper/Not Popper\nChandelier/Not Chandelier\nDryer/Not Dryer\nBookends/Not Bookends\nThe \"Gray Area\" Series: Program 5, 1994, 23:00 min, color, sound\nMake-up/Not Make-up\nSilver Screen/Not Silver Screen\nThe Unknown Series (excerpts), 1994-96, 25 min, color, sound\nProgram I, 1994-95, 12 min.\nPotato Thing; Shaving Cream Thing; Candle Thing; Cookie Thing; Pink Thing; Toothpick Thing; Funnel Thing; Match Thing; Bullet Thing; Diaphragm Thing; Straw Thing; Mayo Thing; Green Velour Pads Thing; Blue Thing; Rat Brain Cells Thing; Pencil Thing; Egg Thing; Cork Thing; Clear Plastic Thing; Fan Thing; 4th of July Thing; Chopsticks Thing; Razor Blade Thing; Dildo Thing; Right Guard Thing; Black and Clear Thing; Marble-ized Thing; Tile Thing; In-A-Gadda-da-Vida Thing; Ruler Thing\nProgram lI, 1995-96, 13 min.\nPencil Thing; Egg Thing; Cork Thing; Clear Plastic Thing; Fan Thing; 4th of July Thing; Chopsticks Thing; Razor Blade Thing; Dildo Thing; Right Guard Thing; Black and Clear Thing; Marble-ized Thing; Tile Thing; In-a-gadda-da-vida Thing; Ruler Thing\nIn the Present, 1996, 12 min, color, sound\nNano-cadabra, 1998, 5:05 min, color, sound\nExhibitions\n1997\n\"Young and Restless\", Museum for Modern Art, New York (USA)\n\"Rooms with a View: Environments for Video\", SoHo Guggenheim, New York (USA)\n\"Public Service and Other Announcements\", Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia (USA)\nImage Forum Festival, Tokio, Osaka, Yokohama, Fukuoka (J)\n1996\n\"In the Present\", Lauren Wittels Gallery, New York (USA)\nThomas Nordanstad Gallery, New York (USA)\n1995: \"Unknown Series\" (excerpts), Lauren Wittels Gallery, New York (USA)\n1994: \"Timing\", TRI Gallery, Los Angeles (USA)\nBibliography\nMorris, Catherine, Phyllis Baldino at Lauren Wittels Gallery, Artnet, 1997\nKatz, Vincent, Phyllis Baldino: In the Present, Artpress, February, 1997\nSmith, Roberta, The Resurging Video: Reclaimed and Reoriented, The New York Times, 21st February, 1997\nArning, Bill, Phyllis Baldino: In the Present, Time Out, 12 - 19th December, 1996\nKandel, Susan, Timing, The Los Angeles Times, 3rd February 1994", "biography_author": null, "date_of_biography": "2025-03-12T22:37:34.522461+11:00", "external_links": [], "uuid": "3b2b8943-205d-4b3d-9298-ebabf2d89b62", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "110021", "external_references": [], "date_modified": "2025-03-12T22:37:34.522790+11:00"}

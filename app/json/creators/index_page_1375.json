1950s. However, he also directed comedies, westerns, and war films. Sirk started his career in Germany as a stage and screen director, but he left for Hollywood in 1937 after his Jewish wife was persecuted by the Nazis.\nIn the 1950s, he achieved his greatest commercial success with film melodramas Magnificent Obsession, All That Heaven Allows, Written on the Wind, A Time to Love and a Time to Die, and Imitation of Life. While those films were initially panned by critics as sentimental women's pictures, they are today widely regarded by film directors, critics, and scholars as masterpieces. His work is seen as a \"critique of the bourgeoisie in general and of 1950s America in particular\", while painting a \"compassionate portrait of characters trapped by social conditions\". Beyond the surface of the film, Sirk worked with complex mise-en-scène and lush Technicolor to underline his statements.", "biography_author": "Wikidata", "date_of_biography": "2023-08-01T14:43:10.912964+10:00", "external_links": [{"id": 3917, "uri": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Sirk"}], "uuid": "38b9573a-e7b4-488c-9a04-c5134acf1968", "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "18412", "external_references": [{"id": 25615, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q60858"}, {"id": 28262, "source": {"name": "VIAF", "slug": "viaf"}, "source_identifier": "14911756"}, {"id": 28263, "source": {"name": "LOC Auth", "slug": "loc-auth"}, "source_identifier": "n79063051"}, {"id": 28264, "source": {"name": "WorldCat", "slug": "worldcat"}, "source_identifier": "lccn-n79063051"}], "date_modified": "2023-08-01T14:43:14.333977+10:00"}, {"id": 32251, "name": "Mary Pickford", "roles_in_work": [{"id": 2302352, "title": "Sleep my love", "work_id": 90520, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1804852, "title": "My best girl [NTSC]", "work_id": 94637, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "also_known_as": "Gladys Louise Smith", "date_of_birth": "1892-04-08", "date_of_death": "1979-05-29", "places_of_operation": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "biography": "Gladys Marie Smith (April 8, 1892 – May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-born American actress, producer, screenwriter and film studio founder, who was a pioneer in the US film industry with a Hollywood career that spanned five decades. \nPickford alongside her future husband, actor-producer Douglas Fairbanks, founded Pickford–Fairbanks Studios and United Artists, and was one of the 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Pickford is considered to be one of the most recognisable women in history.Known as \"America's Sweetheart\" during the silent film era, she is named on the list of the AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars as the 24th-top female star from the Classical Hollywood Cinema era and the \"girl with the curls\".Pickford was one of the Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood and a significant figure in the development of film acting. She was one of the earliest stars to be billed under her own name, and was one of the most popular actresses of the 1910s and 1920s, earning the nickname \"Queen of the Movies\". She is credited with having defined the ingénue type in cinema.She was awarded the second Academy Award for Best Actress for her first sound film role in Coquette (1929).

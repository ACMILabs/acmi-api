The Alliance, supported by the cyber-mechanical Cylon Empire, and the Twelve Colonies of Man have finally agreed to set aside their differences and to sign a peace treaty negotiated by Count Baltar that will end a conflict that has been raging for a thousand years. However, while on a routine reconnaissance mission in his Viper, fighter pilot Apollo finds evidence that the treaty is in fact a trap for the unsuspecting Colonies. Dogged by a contingent of Cylon Raiders, he warns Adama, Commander of the Battlestar Galactica of the deception, but the President of the Colonies, under Baltar&#8217;s treacherous influence, fails to act. As a result, all of the defending battlestars succumb to Cylon attack, with only the Galactica surviving the carnage. As the Cylons systematically begin to destroy the Colonies, Adama rounds up all the survivors, and the motley fleet set off in search of the legendary thirteenth colony, Earth. However, starvation soon takes its toll on the survivors, and the fleet are forced to stop at the mining planet Carillon.

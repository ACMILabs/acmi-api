As there is an embargo on crocodile shooting, Mick decides it would be for the best if the entire family relocate to LA for a spell. Once in LA, Mick lands a role as an extra in a film, gets a job handling animals on set, goes about solving a murder mystery and uncovers some illegal dealings in the movie business. Mick is typically chaotic with his misunderstandings of the cultural nuances of LA, holding up a freeway in order to catch a skunk and foiling muggers with his bush skills. &#8220;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&#8221; is a fish out of water comedy that relies on reviving the successful jokes of its predecessors in the series.

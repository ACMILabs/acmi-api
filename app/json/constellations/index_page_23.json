The genre gives us visions of the future while asking questions about ethics, identity and equality.</p>\n<p>In Things to Come (1936) and Alphaville (1965), we see dreams of perfect worlds clashing with harsh realities, while Big Hero Six (2014) offers a hopeful take on technology being used for good. Movies like Blade Runner (1982) and Ghost in the Shell (1995) explore the line between human and machine, raising questions about identity and what it means to be alive. Even in the chaotic world of Terminator 2 (1991) or the frosted dystopia of Snowpiercer (2013), these films suggest we have the power to change the future.</p>\n<p>Screen culture dares us to dream of what we can achieve, challenging us to make sure that progress brings hope, inclusion, and a future where humanity can thrive alongside technology.</p>\n<p>The AI voice in this visual essay echoes the sensationalist voice-overs common on early sci-fi trailers, while the voice distortion pays tribute to the genre’s often-villainous android characters like HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Ava in Ex Machina (2014).</p>", "constellations_primary": [{"id": 282, "name": "Arcades and AI", "description": "Using the godfather of computing, Alan Turing, as a starting point, this Constellation traces the evolution of AI representation on-screen and the way female androids, robots and holograms have been hyper sexualised."}], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": []}, "date_created": "2020-12-22T17:08:29.847944+11:00", "date_updated": "2024-11-27T15:45:07.336945+11:00", "authors": [{"id": 21, "full_name": "Matt Millikan", "job_title": "Chief Astronomer"}], "links": [{"id": 1781, "start": {"id": 118043, "acmi_id": "184289", "title": "Videogames and Us", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "videogames-and-us", "creator_credit": "ACMI", "credit_line": "<p>Additional research by Dr Dan Golding</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2031-02-16", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2020-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Since videogames were first invented in laboratories, our relationship to play has evolved.

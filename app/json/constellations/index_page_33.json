This deep dive takes viewers through the processes that sustain all life, as air travels from the mouth into the lungs, whirling like a tornado, before circulating around the complex rivers and tributaries of our cardiovascular system. As this life force reaches the outer extremities, from the billowing synapses of the brain to our fingers and toes, the interior blooms into a forest of branching pathways, suffused by a fog of life-bringing oxygen. Through this transcendental narrative, it becomes clear that breath not only sparks life, but also connects us to the natural world through the cycle of respiration.</p>\n<p>At ACMI, Evolver is presented in its original VR form and as three individual moments, including a collective meditation experience and awe-inspiring, large-scale projections.</p>\n<p>Executive produced by Edward R.

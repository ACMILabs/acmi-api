As there is an embargo on crocodile shooting, Mick decides it would be for the best if the entire family relocate to LA for a spell. Once in LA, Mick lands a role as an extra in a film, gets a job handling animals on set, goes about solving a murder mystery and uncovers some illegal dealings in the movie business. Mick is typically chaotic with his misunderstandings of the cultural nuances of LA, holding up a freeway in order to catch a skunk and foiling muggers with his bush skills. &#8220;Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles&#8221; is a fish out of water comedy that relies on reviving the successful jokes of its predecessors in the series.

The artwork opens with a striking close-up of a glamorous woman with a pearl in her eye, who is slowly engulfed by water.

It seeks to capture the dark and chaotic feeling of the current moment, as the climate emergency and rising sea levels wreak catastrophic damage across the Pacific Islands and global south.</p>\n<p>The final scene is created with software more commonly used to develop videogames. This hyper realistic world is filled with towering ice monuments set atop colourful disco flooring and populated by a cast of performers dressed in pink.

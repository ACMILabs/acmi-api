Over five months during Melbourne’s COVID-19 lockdowns, Elliot drew 1600 storyboards, some of which you can see here. Storyboards help directors visualise the story and camera movement before shooting begins, creating a blueprint for filming. Alongside these, he also drew 200 characters, 200 sets and thousands of props, which were later handmade by a team of artists over a year. From the storyboards, a rough animation called an animatic was made, which provided a guide for each shot of the film.

Kitsch shows the middle class, where people use cyberware for looks, featuring bright and flashy buildings. Entropism represents poverty and focuses on function over style, using everyday items with a “cyberpunk twist,” like holographic displays on mirrors. Neomilitarism is the style of megacorporations, which looks sleek, simple and powerful, with big structures like those in Blade Runner. Lastly, Neokitsch is for the ultra-wealthy, using rare materials like gold and leather in its designs.</p>\n<p>The architects of Night City<br />\nThough Night City is inspired by cities like Hong Kong, LA and Detroit, the developers didn’t use actual maps or plans.

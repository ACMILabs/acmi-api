Set in 2070, 15 years after a nuclear explosion destroys Los Angeles, the film explores how technology and humanity struggle to coexist. The movie draws inspiration from classic sci-fi like Blade Runner (1982) and Akira (1988) and the anti-war message of Apocalypse Now (1979). The Creator uses vivid world-building to merge cyberpunk and retro-futurist styles with themes of conflict and coexistence.</p>\n<p>The story follows Joshua (John David Washington), a soldier with cybernetic prosthetics who must destroy a new AI weapon. In New Asia, where people live peacefully with AI, Joshua discovers that the weapon is a simulant child, who he names Alphie (Madeleine Yuna). Through his growing bond with Alphie, Joshua confronts his own biases, realising that peace between humans and AI is possible.</p>\n<p>The Creator combines futuristic landscapes with existing cultures, reflecting fears of both nuclear war and artificial intelligence. In this future vision, technology and humanity find a path to peace.</p>\n<p>Retrofuturism in character and prop design<br />\nThe Creator’s robots have an insect-like design (see the robotic monk on the left), but the AI simulants are the emotional heart of the film. Though they have human faces, the backs of their heads are a mechanical mix of human and machine. This design is retrofuturism – a style that blends old and new technology, with a focus on physical, hands-on elements. Props like Alphie’s game console and translator look like they’re from an alternate version of the 1980s or 1990s. Retrofuturism gives the film a timeless look and creates a nostalgic, human feel that contrasts with the idea of a sleek, perfect future.</p>\n<p>World building in The Creator<br />\nDirector Gareth Edwards and designer James Clyne created a detailed sci-fi world by mixing futuristic ideas with real places. Clyne took photos of locations in Asia and added sci-fi elements, sometimes turning local people into AI characters called ‘simulants’. They decided who became a simulant during the editing process after filming. This let them film quickly using handheld cameras, giving the movie a fast-paced action style.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 343, "name": "Retrofuturism: aesthetic impact of space design on screen culture", "description": "Humans have long imagined the future, including prospective travel to space and what living life away from planet earth could look like.

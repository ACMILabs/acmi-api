Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly creatures, The Frighteners, Meet the Feebles) went to incredible lengths to re-create Tolkien&#8217;s fantastical vision to the screen, by building extensive realistic sets in his native New Zealand, and by employing a slew of gifted special effects artists. In short, Frodo Baggins, a kind-hearted and earnest hobbit, is entrusted with the gallant mission to return a powerful ring from whence it came - Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. Failure to do so will result in the destruction of the earth, as the powerful ring is capable of unleashing inestimable evil. Guided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, Frodo is accompanied on his treacherous journey by three hobbit friends, a dwarf, an elf and several humans. This heroic quest invokes all the necessary thrills of an adventure picture, whilst satiating the exacting standards of an audience inured to CGI wizardry, and gratifying legions of zealous Tolkien fans. With ambitious battle scenes and stupendous set pieces, this grand and masterful cinematic spectacle kept most viewers utterly enthralled, whilst earning Jackson almost universal praise for capturing Tolkien&#8217;s mythopoeic narrative and elegiac tone.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 338, "name": "Sublime light and special effects", "description": "Explore 19th-century artist John Martin’s surprising influence on science fiction and fantasy films of the 20th century, from <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i> to the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and the <i>Evil Dead</i> franchises."}], "recommendations": []}, "end": {"id": 61146, "acmi_id": "tmdb-movie-254", "title": "King Kong", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "king-kong", "creator_credit": "Philippa Boyens, Carolynne Cunningham, Fran Walsh, Jan Blenkin, Peter Jackson and Jeremy Bennett", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, New Zealand and United States of America, 2005", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": true, "first_production_date": "2005-12-12T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 22348, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "254"}, {"id": 49682, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q160215"}], "brief_description": "<p>In 1933 New York, an overly ambitious movie producer coerces his cast and hired ship crew to travel to mysterious Skull Island, where they encounter Kong, a giant ape who is immediately smitten with the leading lady.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 338, "name": "Sublime light and special effects", "description": "Explore 19th-century artist John Martin’s surprising influence on science fiction and fantasy films of the 20th century, from <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i> to the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and the <i>Evil Dead</i> franchises."}, {"id": 102, "name": "MoCaps and rotos", "description": "Though VFX continues to push boundaries and brings fantastical worlds and creatures to life, there's still a place for classic animation techniques."}], "recommendations": []}, "description": "<p>Peter Jackson created a remake of <I>King Kong</i> in 2005.

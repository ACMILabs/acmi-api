In this unique tribute to Lennon, over 23 of the world&#8217;s greatest performers bring a little bit of magic to Lennon&#8217;s songs as they perform their own interpretations of his classics. From Lenny Kravitz singing &#8220;Cold Turkey&#8221; to Hall and Oates singing &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me down&#8221; to Elton John performing &#8220;Imagine&#8221; we are moved by the strength of the emotions Lennon&#8217;s words still evoke today. Hosted by Michael Douglas, these memorable songs are intercut with rare archival footage of John Lennon and The Beatles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Beatles (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Lennon, John, 1940-1980", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "People&nbsp;→ Beatles (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Lennon, John, 1940-1980"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 781844, "name": "John Lennon Tribute Ltd", "creator_id": 25430, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781845, "name": "Ian Bolt", "creator_id": 25431, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781846, "name": "Philip Chilvers", "creator_id": 25432, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781847, "name": "Gavin Taylor", "creator_id": 22826, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 781843, "name": "Splash Music", "creator_id": 77364, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39197", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [22769]}, {"id": 83152, "acmi_id": "304354", "title": "Leningrad Cowboys go America", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "leningrad-cowboys-go-america", "creator_credit": "Villealfa Filmproductions, Svenska filminstitutet, Klas Oloffson, Aki Kaurismaki and Katinka Farago", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Finland, 1989", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Somewhere in the wastelands of the Soviet Union lives the worst rock- &#8220;rock-&#8216;n&#8221;-roll&#8221; band in the world; an outfit with no audience and no commercial potential.

With support for multicolour sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware. Because of this, the C64 was often used as a home gaming console, with accessories such as datasettes and gaming joysticks.<br />\nThe Commodore 64 holds a unique place in the history of video games.

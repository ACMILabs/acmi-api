Overall this is a fascinating tale that mixes interviews with archival footage, thus presenting a very humanistic slant on what was a cruel and murderous time in history.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canada", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Biography", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Canada", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ Canada - History", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "People&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Biography", "Places&nbsp;→ Canada", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2347007, "name": "Eva Colmers", "creator_id": 81136, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271245", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347002, "name": "Bonnie Thompson", "creator_id": 81135, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337503", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347004, "name": "Jerry Krepakevich", "creator_id": 16441, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143805", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2346998, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1530721", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2346997, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53095", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [34540]}, {"id": 75548, "acmi_id": "012967", "title": "The End of the game", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-end-of-the-game", "creator_credit": "Robin Lehman, Claire Wilbur and Opus Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1975", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44987, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q12117815"}], "brief_description": "<p>In the African dawn, thunderclouds gather, welcomed by croaking frogs in the marshes.

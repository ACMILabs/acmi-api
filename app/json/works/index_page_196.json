Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America.

The first segment is titled, &#8216;The Animals&#8217; and features the family pets including dogs, calves, cows and the audacious cockatoo named Ticka, at home in suburban Heathmont in Melbourne’s outer east.</p>\n<p>There are travel scenes of Narracan East, King River and the &#8216;Astor&#8217; motel at Albury where Charles takes some dramatic footage of the Hume Weir. The family were keen tennis players and visited Albury at Easter so likely took part in the Albury Tennis Association competitions.</p>\n<p>As well are some beach scenes at Point Leo, Golden Beach and Frankston where we see one of the dogs up to its neck in sand and some great examples of sixties bathing suits and sun hats.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker shows some of the great cars at the time so that we see examples of 1960s and 1970s models. A brief segment from the Moomba Festival in Melbourne shows the &#8216;Frankston by the Sea&#8217; song lyrics on one of the floats at the time.</p>\n<p>Charles also shows the family&#8217;s involvement in tennis, trying out an early model Cortina car, and celebrating &#8216;Elinor&#8217;s 21st&#8217; in white gloves and evening gowns and a display of the presents.</p>\n<p>A particular feature of the film is the footage of &#8216;Southgate Fountain&#8217; public art work by Robin Boyd (now demolished to make way for the redevelopment of Southgate on Melbourne&#8217;s Yarra river).</p>\n<p>Originally made using Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:34:00 calves up close<br />\n00:00:53:00 a calf and a dog nuzzling and playing<br />\n00:01:33:00 family pet dog and &#8216;Ticka&#8217;

Told effectively in flashback, the film recounts Charlies days as a poor but honest son of a Jewish immigrant who reaches the heights of professional and financial success, but loses his ethics and the respect of his family and long time girlfriend (Lilli Palmer) as he succumbs to the corruption and greed surrounding the boxing ring. Rossen and screenwriter Abraham Polonsky&#8217;s parable about the dark side of the American dream is made even more pertinent by the fact that Rossen, Polonsky and star John Garfield were brought in front of the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for their alleged communist affiliations. Rossen was subsequently blacklisted (along with Polonsky), but desperate to work ended up naming party members two years later. James Wong Howes stark black and white cinematography and the realistically staged boxing sequences were to become a major influence on Martin Scorsese 33 years later for his boxing masterpiece, &#8220;Raging Bull&#8221;. Cast also includes Hazel Brooks, William Conrad, Joseph Pevney and Lloyd Goff. (Awards: Winner of the 1948 Academy Award for Best Film Editing, Francis D.

An underworld comedy of manners unfolds as Bob&#8217;s morality is tested through the double-crosses of the other protagonists and an unforseen murder. The film is a homage to American cinema, namely John Huston, through the underlying motif of failure. Its gritty, free-wheeling style with its jump-cuts, jazzy score and visual quotes predates the French New Wave. Melville was only able to afford three lights when shooting the film which meant that most of the backgrounds had a hazy appearance. This effect became a trademark of the film and made Henri Decae, a director of photography, in high demand. Cast includes Isabel Corey, Roger Duchesne, Daniel Cauchy and Guy Decomble.

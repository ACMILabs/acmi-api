Alfred Sui, an American educated Chinese who has lived in Hong Kong for twenty years, created the &#8220;I Club&#8221;, a glitzy disco nightclub located in the heart of Hong Kong&#8217;s financial district in the Bank of America building and fashioned in the western style of the New York nightclubs. The &#8220;I Club&#8221; represented modern western architecture and design and featured paintings by world renowned artists, including many of Andy Warhol&#8217;s work. Alfred Sui invited Andy Warhol and his entourage to open his new night club in 1985 which was to be patronised by the wealthy and famous, who wish to see and be seen. In the following days after the opening, Andy becomes a tourist visiting Peking, the Great Wall of China, Red Square but all the time comparing eastern culture with western culture and appearing to be mildly disappointed in the lack of westernization in China (no McDonalds!). Andy&#8217;s egocentricity also begins to surface as he realises that the Chinese really do not know who Andy Warhol is, that it is only American tourists who recognise him and want to take his photo. A strange but interesting doco with rare footage of a relaxed and open Andy Warhol.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Warhol, Andy, 1928-1987", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Beijing (China)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ East and west", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hong Kong - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hong Kong - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travel", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ East and west", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - China", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Warhol, Andy, 1928-1987", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ East and west", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "People&nbsp;→ Warhol, Andy, 1928-1987", "Places&nbsp;→ Beijing (China)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 883115, "name": "Lee Evan Caplin", "creator_id": 80324, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883114, "name": "Lee Caplin Productions", "creator_id": 35314, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51106", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [33038]}, {"id": 81045, "acmi_id": "36893", "title": "Andy Warhol and His Work", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "andy-warhol-and-his-work", "creator_credit": "Lana Jokel and RM Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1973", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1973-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film is a fascinating insight into the man and his work as seen through his own eyes and those of his friends.

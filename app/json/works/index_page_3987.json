For example, it is forbidden for Muslim women to marry Jewish men, but a Muslim man is allowed to marry a Jewish woman if she converts to Islam. In Judaism it is forbidden to marry outside the religion, Christians are against mixed marriages and Islam although condoning marriage by Muslim men with Jews or Christians do not condone marriage with Buddhists, Hindus or atheists. All the couples interviewed in this documentary have gone against the social, political and religious norms but in their personal narratives we see the human side of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the pain of being ex-communicated from unaccepting family and friends, of children growing up not knowing their grandparents, and of bitter prejudices of religious and racial intolerances. But the over-riding factor is the love and respect for each other and each other&#8217;s culture and religion. Along with the couples&#8217; stories we are also given an insight to the religious point of view through leaders from each of the respective faiths, Islam, Christian and Judaism. Director, Michel Khleifi, through this film points out the urgent need for the Middle East to bring in a civil code of marriage which will liberate the individual from all religious constraints, from the three monotheistic faiths, and allow a freedom of choice.

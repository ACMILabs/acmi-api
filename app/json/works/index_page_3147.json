A claustrophobic police thriller set just after the handover of Hong Kong to China, &#8216;Full Alert&#8217; revives the &#8216;film bleu&#8217; tradition of Hong Kong cop and gangster films, its belligerent energy recalling the sense of anarchy in Hong Kong films of the eighties. Inspector Pao is a grizzled, jaded veteran cop who has seen it all in his years with the Hong Kong police. After a vicious murderer escapes to Taiwan, Pau vows to track him down. To him he represents a new kind of criminal&#8212; smart, canny, ambitious and vicious&#8212; a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. As in Michael Mann&#8217;s &#8216;Heat&#8217; (1996) to which &#8216;Full Alert&#8217; has been compared, the cop and the robber are set up as a pair of compelling twins/opposites driven to battle each other.

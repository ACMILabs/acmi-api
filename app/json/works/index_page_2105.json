Tom&#8217;s isolation from his family is made worse by his anger at their relocation from London to the lonely coast of Devon, and by his having to keep his anxieties and fears from his mother who has just given birth to a baby girl. But as Jessie&#8217;s behaviour becomes more self-destructive, as Tom&#8217;s suspicions find confirmation, and as he begins to mistrust his father&#8217;s relationships with the three women of the house, Tom becomes more convinced that he must act. Shot in long dark takes which powerfully suggest Tom&#8217;s growing claustrophobia in the family &#8220;war zone&#8221;, and featuring outstanding performances by Ray Winstone and Tilda Swinton as the parents, and by first time performers Lara Belmont and Freddie Cunliffe as Jessie and Tom, &#8220;The War Zone&#8221; is a chilling and adult examination of familial betrayal and abuse.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2476541, "name": "Tim Roth", "creator_id": 79543, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q203804", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476540, "name": "Dixie Linder", "creator_id": 79542, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q82920181", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476539, "name": "Sarah Radclyffe", "creator_id": 85357, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476536, "name": "Film Four International", "creator_id": 23614, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222732", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476538, "name": "Portobello Pictures", "creator_id": 24305, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q78158192", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476537, "name": "Sarah Radclyffe Productions", "creator_id": 32835, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48664", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [30802]}, {"id": 93800, "acmi_id": "317413", "title": "Muppets from space [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "muppets-from-space-dvd", "creator_credit": "Tim Hill, Brian Henson, Martin G.

He devises an inventive way of keeping the loan sharks at bay, by creating prologues that can precede the talkies themselves, riding on the coat tails of the very thing that put him out of business in the first place. The comedy and drama of the film is derived from the activities of the players who are part of Cagney&#8217;s troupe producing the prologues. There&#8217;s the gold digger (Claire Dodd), the disgruntled ex-wife (Renee Whitney), the secretary with secret artistic abilities (Ruby Keeler), the faithful Girl Friday (Joan Blondell) who stands by the man who doesn&#8217;t know that she loves him, the long suffering personal assistant (Hugh Herbert), and the young protegee (Dick Powell).

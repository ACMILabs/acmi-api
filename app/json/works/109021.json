The Digital Diary project asks a diverse range of young people to share a personal story as they connect memories by way of simple moving images. Participants in the workshops look at one &#8216;moment&#8217; in their lives and, concentrating on the simplicity and power of that one moment in time, they create a &#8216;lo-fi&#8217; video work that speaks to the mind and heart. The story is then burnt to a CD (or put onto VHS) for the participants to keep, and the monologues become part of a specially curated database which, with the participant&#8217;s permission, is later screened at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image at Federation Square.</p>",

The battle sequences of the final attack are a truly memorable spectacle in the depiction of this pivotal event in American history when, in 1836, 185 &#8220;Texans&#8221; held off an army of 7000 Mexican troops to secure the independence of the State. This epic masterpiece earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture. A haunting musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin and co-starring Frankie Avalon.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Texas", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Crockett, Davy, 1786-1836", "History&nbsp;→ Mexico - History", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History - 1865-1921", "People&nbsp;→ Crockett, Davy, 1786-1836", "Places&nbsp;→ Texas", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Captioned"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953462, "name": "John Wayne", "creator_id": 76823, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953461, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953460, "name": "Batjac Productions", "creator_id": 26929, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953459, "name": "The Alamo Company", "creator_id": 26928, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953458, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18092, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/dXT8g86t0x2SHWgCxQlhfKbPOWu.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Alamo  (John Wayne) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41006", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [24521]}, {"id": 93819, "acmi_id": "14885", "title": "The Airport", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-airport", "creator_credit": "Bridget Robertson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "VIC/Australia, 2006", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2006-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Bridget Robertson goes to the airport to collect her sister&#8217;s body.

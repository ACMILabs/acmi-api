This white featureless facade pointedly alludes to the alienated individual whose sense of self has been completely eroded by personal circumstances and general societal mores. Any overt reference to Georges Franju&#8217;s 1959 eerie horror classic &#8220;Eyes without a face&#8221; (which also featured an outcast character with a blank white mask as a face) remain conspicuously absent as Bruiser aims for more visceral thrills than it&#8217;s eloquent predecessor. Cast includes: Peter Stormare, Leslie Hope, Nina Garbiras.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/bruiser", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2125947, "name": "George A.

From the confines of the asylum Kiichi drifts into a fantasy world where he believes that the sun is an inferno created by the Earth when it exploded in a nuclear holocaust. &#8216;I Live in fear&#8217; is Kurosawa&#8217;s blatant criticism of the perils of nuclear warfare, and was produced at the height of the Cold War when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union were all experimenting with nuclear testing. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was also a recent and painful memory. This a powerful study of patriarchy in Japanese society, and what Kiichi is willing to do to convince his family to support his beliefs. Although unpopular at the box office compared to his other films, Kurosawa thought of this film as one his most proudest moments, and thus deserves due consideration. Cast includes Toshiro Mifune, Kyoko Aoyama, Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Cold War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Fear", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nuclear warfare", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nuclear weapons - Testing", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Fear", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adjustment (Psychology)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Adjustment (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fear", "Foreign language films", "People&nbsp;→ Immigrants"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/i-live-in-fear", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816739, "name": "Shojiro Motoki", "creator_id": 22351, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q11520413", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956348, "name": "Toho Kabushiki Kaisha", "creator_id": 22350, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956350, "name": "Akira Kurosawa", "creator_id": 72664, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8006", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956347, "name": "Museum of the Moving Image (BFI)", "creator_id": 77014, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44091", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1955", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1955"}], "labels": [27112], "external_references": [{"id": 1243, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2273270"}, {"id": 4467, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "21490"}]}, {"id": 93530, "acmi_id": "316985", "title": "I like you: I like you very much", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-like-you-i-like-you-very-much", "creator_credit": "Suzuki Akihiro and Oki Hiroyuki", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This low-budget slice-of-life drama broke new ground in Japan in its representation of gay relationships and sex.

This program focuses on Ireland and some of the Irish playwrights who gave birth to a new kind of theatre, one that had more substance than the 19th century Victorian melodrama and moralising society plays which were being performed in Britain, most significantly, at a time when Ireland was fighting for independence from British empirical connections. Richard Eyre discusses in great detail the influences and historical background of several Irish playwrights including William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Sean O&#8217;Casey, and J.M. Synge and the part these individuals played in the establishment of a national theatre and a national identity for Ireland. Yeats, Shaw and Wilde were all born in Dublin around the same time, but Shaw and Wilde very early on exiled themselves to England to make their fame and fortune through satirising the English high society. In contrast, against a background of political turmoil and tension, Yeats, in collaboration with Lady Augusta Gregory, conceived The Abbey Theatre which was to become Ireland&#8217;s national theatre and a stage for the works of Sean O&#8217;Casey and J.M.

It is a story of deep pain, long struggle and great bravery leading to a real victory of the human spirit. Redgrave&#8217;s rivetting performance is unforgettable - aging from 22 to 54 and changing from man to woman. She imbues every gesture with dignity and truth as a transexual who did what she knew was right. Co-starring Martin Balsam, William Russ, Alice Krige, Kerrie Keane, Richard Venture, Reni Santoni and Louise Fletcher. Based on the book of the same title by Rene Richards with John Ames.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953114, "name": "Anthony Page", "creator_id": 24772, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953113, "name": "Lorimar Telepictures Productions", "creator_id": 26692, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953112, "name": "Linda Yellen", "creator_id": 26691, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953111, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40754", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [24282]}]}

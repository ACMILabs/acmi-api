Producer/director Orson Welles plays Othello and considered it to be one of his best films. Sadly, the film was believed to be lost for over thirty years. Finally, the original nitrate negative was tracked down and using today&#8217;s most innovative techniques, the film has been restored frame by frame to its original 91 minute director&#8217;s cut. Now this film is finally accessible to whole new generations of movie audiences.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-tragedy-of-othello-the-moor-of-venice", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951707, "name": "Castle Hill", "creator_id": 25674, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951708, "name": "Orson Welles", "creator_id": 66876, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951706, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39504", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1952", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1952"}], "labels": [23070], "external_references": [{"id": 140, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2704454"}, {"id": 5077, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "47697"}]}]}

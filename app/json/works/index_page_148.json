In &#8220;Raging bull&#8221; Scorsese continues his obsession with the dark side of the urban American psyche and the result is a largely pessimistic but passionate piece of filmmaking. The boxing sequences are operatic in their violent excess and not for weak stomachs. Despite numerous Oscar nominations (and a Best Actor win for De Niro) the film received a mixed critical reaction and performed poorly at the box-office. Currently however, &#8220;Raging bull&#8221; is considered a masterpiece of American cinema.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Biographical", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/raging-bull", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963322, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963323, "name": "Irwin Winkler", "creator_id": 57099, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963324, "name": "Robert Chartoff", "creator_id": 61932, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963325, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "creator_id": 3485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963321, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51831", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [33481], "external_references": [{"id": 5190, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "1578"}]}, {"id": 80840, "acmi_id": "324886", "title": "Radio days", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "radio-days", "creator_credit": "Orion Pictures Corporation, Robert Greenhut and Woody Allen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>I love old radio stories, and I know a million of them.

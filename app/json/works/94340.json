The film consists of a series of excerpts from badly deteriorated nitrate film drawn from film archives across the United States. Streaked, misted, solarised, bubbled and speckled by blooms of chemical disintegration, the footage covers a wide range of subject matter including imagery of war, progress, colonisation and everyday life. Manipulating the distorted images further through slow motion, strobing and morphing, Morrison creates a hallucinatory canvas where the documentary footage that was intended to provide a permanent record of historical moments for posterity, is swallowed by the decay that has overtaken the nitrate stock. Like the progress of a deadly virus as seen under a microscope, the decay distorts and consumes the images in a haunting, mysterious and beautiful dance of destruction. A meditation on mortality and the ephemeral nature of corporeality, history, and the endeavors of humankind.

The film consists of a series of excerpts from badly deteriorated nitrate film drawn from film archives across the United States. Streaked, misted, solarised, bubbled and speckled by blooms of chemical disintegration, the footage covers a wide range of subject matter including imagery of war, progress, colonisation and everyday life.

Like the progress of a deadly virus as seen under a microscope, the decay distorts and consumes the images in a haunting, mysterious and beautiful dance of destruction. A meditation on mortality and the ephemeral nature of corporeality, history, and the endeavors of humankind.

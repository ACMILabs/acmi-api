Episode three focuses on Roberts&#8217; painting &#8220;Shearing the rams&#8221; and his attempts to sell it first to the National Gallery (Victoria) who reject the offer and then to whoever in &#8220;society&#8221; Melbourne might be interested. The issue is just how far and to what lengths will Roberts go in his quest to be a successful Australian artist. Condor, meanwhile, is in Paris whilst Streeton, having left Melbourne to reside in Sydney, is successfully selling his works to the New South Wales Gallery who have pledged to purchase &#8220;Australian&#8221; paintings.

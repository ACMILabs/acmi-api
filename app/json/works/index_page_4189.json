Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>In Reel 16 the royal couple visit regional Victorian towns; including &#8216;behind the scenes&#8217; shots of press and radio recording the tour, and the enthusiastic welcome given by the citizens of rural Victoria.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 16:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Shepparton&#8221;, followed by footage of crowds waiting to see the royal visitors. 00:00:26:00 Queen and Duke arrive and meet some locals. 00:00:36:00 Queen, Duke and local Mayor mount dais for speeches (by Mayor and Queen). 00:00:58:00 Queen and Duke re-enter car for drive through town; crowds line streets.

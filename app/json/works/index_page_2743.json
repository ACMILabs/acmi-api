Cast includes: Willa O&#8217;Neill, Neill Rea, Ashleigh Seagar, Taika Cohen, Charlie Bleakley, John Brazier, Mark Neilson and Mark Dudfield.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social conditions", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students - Attitudes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs, Nonprescription"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2263421, "name": "Robert Sarkis", "creator_id": 34840, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263415, "name": "Lisa Chatfield", "creator_id": 34839, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299099", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263413, "name": "Nightmare Productions", "creator_id": 34838, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357756", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2263408, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50680", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32653]}, {"id": 89096, "acmi_id": "311743", "title": "SBS Insight: millennium bug", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sbs-insight-millennium-bug", "creator_credit": "Tatjana Djamin and Australia.

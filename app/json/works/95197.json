The final patient used to be a doctor and makes creepy robot models that have fully functioning brains and murderous intentions. Scary fun stuff with appropriate orchestral music to make sure you know when something weird is about to happen and the final twist reveals just who is Dr Starr.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Asylum</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Roy Baker, Milton Subotsky, Max J Rosenberg, Amicus Productions and Harbour productions</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Are the patients incurably insane or just part of the occult?

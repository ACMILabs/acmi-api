Doogue speaks to civil celebrant Dally Messenger, one of Australia&#8217;s longest practising civil celebrants, Diane Storey who specializes in funerals, John Hill, an ex Roman Catholic priest who missed the rituals of the church and became a civil celebrant, Gael Brigden, a celebrant on a television program, and Paul Charvet-Jackson who specialises in same sex commitment ceremonies. The celebrants share their thoughts on what inspires them, how they devise the rituals, the preparation that takes place, and the future of their profession.

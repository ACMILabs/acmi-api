The Comite d&#8217;Organisation de l&#8217;Industrie Cinematographique (COIC), established in 1940 to revitalise French production and distribution, was continued in a modified form as the Centre National de la Cinematography (CNC) after 1946. (&#8230;) From 1940 a CNC committee began to elect projects deemed worthy of &#8216;primes de la qualite&#8217; or &#8216;bonuses for quality&#8217;, including literary adaptations of classic by Zola, Stendhal and Maupassant. (&#8230;) Among the literary adaptations central to the success of the &#8216;tradition de qualite&#8217; were Christian-Jacques&#8217;s &#8216;La Chartreuse de Parme&#8217; (1948)<em> and Claude Autant-Lara&#8217;s &#8216;Le Rouge et le Noir&#8217; (1954)</em>, both taken from 19th century novels by Stendahl. (&#8230;) The decline of poetic realism was most clearly marked in the hostile reception of Marcel Carne&#8217;s and Jacques Prevert&#8217;s &#8216;Les portes de la nuit&#8217; (1946)<em>. Although the film was set in post-war Paris, the fantastical plot and Alexandre Trauner&#8217;s stylised sets &#8216;already seemed dated, belonging to the past era&#8217;. After the commercial and critical failure of &#8216;Les portes de la nuit&#8217;, Carne&#8217;s fantasy film &#8216;Juliette ou la cle des songes&#8217;(1951)</em> met a similar fate, as did Jean Cocteau&#8217;s cryptic fantasy &#8216;Orphee&#8217;(1950)<em>. If the historical drama flourished in the 1950&#8217;s, the fantasy genre entered an almost terminal decline, not arrested until the coming of the &#8216;cinema du look&#8217; in the 1980s.&#8221; Reference: Guy Austin. &#8216;Contemporary French cinema&#8217;. Manchester University Press, 1996. Back from Hollywood, Rene Clair produces an other string of classic such as &#8216;Le silence est d&#8217;or&#8217;</em>, &#8216;La beaute de diable&#8217;<em>, &#8216;Les belles de nuit&#8217;</em>, &#8216;Les grandes manoeuvres&#8217; and &#8216;Porte des Lilas&#8217;, the last film shot in the old fashioned way with fully reconstituted studio sceneries. Renoir continues an international career with successes such as &#8216;The river&#8217;, &#8216;Le carrosse d&#8217;or&#8217;<em>, &#8216;Helena et les hommes&#8217;, and &#8216;French Can Can&#8217;</em>.

Rene Clement&#8217;s &#8216;La bataille du rail&#8217;<em> and &#8216;Jeux interdits&#8217;.

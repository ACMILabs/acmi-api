However, Jack has to produce a family heir before any of this can take place. The lengths the family go to and the unexpected, hilarious and truly bizarre outcomes of their efforts, including Jack beginning to secretly think that he is Jack the Ripper and murdering one of the family members, add up to a most unusual and enjoyable cinematic experience consisting of narrative and vaudeville song-and-dance sequences, mixed in with a good measure of black comedy and contempt for the British class system. Cast also includes Arthur Lowe, Alastair Sim, Coral Browne, Michael Bryant, William Mervyn, Carolyn Seymour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Parody", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Inheritance and succession", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Inheritance and succession", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Vaudeville"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-ruling-class", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996769, "name": "Peter Medak", "creator_id": 25548, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q724100", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996768, "name": "Jack Hawkins", "creator_id": 80017, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996767, "name": "Jules Buck", "creator_id": 23715, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996766, "name": "Keep Films", "creator_id": 34548, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50364", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [32342], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92851, "acmi_id": "316186", "title": "Play misty for me [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "play-misty-for-me-dvd", "creator_credit": "Clint Eastwood, Robert Daley, Malpaso Company and Universal Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In this contemporary thriller, Clint Eastwood plays the popular California disc jockey, Dave Garland.

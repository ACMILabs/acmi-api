As harrowing and confronting as it may be, this film is compulsory viewing, brilliant in its directing and its cast with Janusz Gajos and Adam Ferency in the roles of the interrogators - Gajos as the meticulous but sadistically cruel Citizen Major and Ferency as the second but more sympathetic interrogator, Morawsky. &#8220;Interrogation&#8221; will stay with you long after you have seen it. Cast also includes Agnieszke Holland and Anna Romantowska.

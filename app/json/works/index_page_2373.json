While this film culminates in two spectacular battles between the humans of Helm&#8217;s Deep and Saruman&#8217;s vicious minions and Saruman and the Ents, the tale twists and turns around numerous subplots and many new characters, including the twisted half-hobbit Gollum, a warped creature who will do anything to regain what he believes is rightfully his. Once again, Jackson and his screenwriters successfully reproduce a classic tale, which, unlike a number of blockbuster sequels, equals if not surpasses its predecessor, both enthralling and teasing the audience as the tale continues. Cast includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, John Rhys-Davies, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, Bernard Hill, David Wenham and Andy Serkis as the voice of Gollum.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Greek"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Special effects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Battles", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Myth", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Myth", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Motion picture sequels", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 916006, "name": "Wingnut Films", "creator_id": 31880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916007, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916008, "name": "Barrie M Osborne", "creator_id": 78658, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q808917", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916009, "name": "Fran Walsh", "creator_id": 72165, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916010, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 916005, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52494", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34042], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95010, "acmi_id": "319049", "title": "The Lord of the rings: the return of the king", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king-dvd", "creator_credit": "Wingnut Films, New Line Cinema, Barrie M Osborne, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "New Zealand, 2003", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Final part of Peter Jacksons iconic adaptation of J R R Tolkien&#8217;s fantasy epic, &#8220;The Lord of the rings&#8221; trilogy sees the interleaved narrative threads of parts one and two drawn to closure.

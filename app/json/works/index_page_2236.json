Addiction to food, to heroin, to diet pills, and that most everyday habit, to television. If film noir attacked The American Dream, then Darren Aronofsky&#8217;s follow-up to &#8220;Pi&#8221; sees that dream kidnapped, tortured and burned. This is exacted in the junkie lifestyle of Harry and his friends, as well as the loneliness of his mother, portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, whose performance makes &#8220;Requiem for a dream&#8221; one of the best movies of 2001. A victim to heroin chic but also, eventually, a critic, this film is aimed at a young audience but takes the unusual step of actually having something to say. The screenplay was written by Aronofsky and Hubert Selby Jnr (&#8216;Last Exit To Brooklyn&#8217;), based on the latter&#8217;s novel. It also features one of the most progressive film soundtracks of recent years, written and performed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amphetamine drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Narcotic addicts", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Drug use"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960856, "name": "Artisan Entertainment", "creator_id": 64268, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960857, "name": "Thousand Words Productions", "creator_id": 79893, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960858, "name": "Eric Watson", "creator_id": 30728, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960859, "name": "Darren Aronofsky", "creator_id": 65068, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960855, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50100", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32106]}, {"id": 95287, "acmi_id": "319353", "title": "Requiem by Andrew Lloyd Webber", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "requiem-by-andrew-lloyd-webber", "creator_credit": "BBC-TV, The Really Useful Group, Ian Squires and Humphrey Burton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1985", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Filmed on location at the St Thomas Church, New York, on Sunday February 24th 1985, the world premiere of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#8217;s &#8220;Requiem&#8221; was performed to an enthusiastic and receptive audience.

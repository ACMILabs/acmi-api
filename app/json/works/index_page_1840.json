Amina and Nur went to Tianshan district, Xinjiang to recruit new students on behalf of the Provincial Song and Dance Ensemble. A girl with a beautiful singing voice called, Mayila caught Amina’s attention. It happened that Amina’s estranged daughter during the Cultural Revolution many years ago was also called Mayila. Amina and Nur’s recruitment work went well but Mayila’s foster father would not allow her to take the test as he hated to let her go. Amina sent Nur to talk to Mayila’s father, and the latter realized that Mayila was Amina’s daughter. He decided to allow Mayila to go and gave her a pair of beautiful dancing shoes, telling her that she should only wear them for the National Day Celebration Performance.

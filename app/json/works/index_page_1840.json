Appealing to audiences in a broad range of age levels and economic circumstances, it combines dramatization with voice-over narration to show real people in different situations as they learn about planning a family. Among the motivations for choosing to practise family planning shown in this film are health, emotional maturity, economic stability, and the need to provide each child with individual love and attention. It provides invaluable information about the positive aspects of family planning, giving the viewer an opportunity to learn, discuss and to arrive at very carefully considered decisions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 857370, "name": "Moreland-Latchford Productions", "creator_id": 12181, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 857371, "name": "John Churchill", "creator_id": 16642, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 857372, "name": "H Lemieux", "creator_id": 17466, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27660", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [11453]}, {"id": 115745, "acmi_id": "Z000002", "title": "Purplish red crown = Zi se de huang guan", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "purplish-red-crown-zi-se-de-huang-guan", "creator_credit": "Shanghai Film Studio and Yu Benzheng", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The film takes place over the course of a single day.</p>\n<p>Taxi driver Zhan works hard for little money. One morning he picks up Chen, a film director, and his manager Xing, to take them to a production meeting for an uninspired film.

Throwing him in the taxi, he threatens to take the child home and demand the money for his hefty fine. Though not before they make a few stops for the two businessmen. Along the way, Zhan antagonises the boy, who becomes increasingly distressed. Discovering a photo of his father in his pocket, Zhan calls the soldier insignificant. Upset and defensive, the boy declares that his father was a Rank 23 Cadre who served in Xingjiang. Chen, the director, befriends the boy, listening intently as he shares stories of the brave soldier.

Coach Su, coincidentally, is Wao Xiaobing&#8217;s former teacher, and she tells the men that his veteran father has divorced his mother and moved to another district, and that his mother has now remarried. The boy&#8217;s familial story provides inspiration to Chen&#8217;s dull script, and the men decide to probe him for more information. Through a series of flashbacks, we gradually learn more about Wao Xiaobing&#8217;s past and his relationship with his father.

When they return to the car after the meeting, they find that Wao Xiaobing has escaped, apparently driven away by Zhan&#8217;s ill-tempered threats. While Chen and his manager worry about the safety of the boy, Zhan maintains his anger. They search the city for him, and learn from a gathered crowd that a young boy fitting Wao Xiaobing’s description has been hit by a car. Panicking, the men run to the nearest hospital to find him, but are not allowed into the operating theatre. Disguising themselves as doctors, they sneak in and encounter a number of doctors working furiously on the boy. The child, however, is not Wao Xiaobing. Relieved, the men frantically continue their search, having formed a bond with the boy. When they return to the car, they find Wao Xiaobing asleep next to it. They scold the boy for worrying them, and he explains that he wanted to go home but didn’t know the way.

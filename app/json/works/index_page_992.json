THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>This film is indicative of a common preoccupation of Chinese Cinema of the time – the relationship between classes.</p>\n<p>Lao Li&#8217;s class ambition and desire to conceal his family&#8217;s peasant roots is incredibly disagreeable, and the way he regards his wife is borderline misogynistic. He appears to detest her for no other reason than her natural peasant inclinations.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to determine whether or not the film is critical of Lao Li&#8217;s snobbery and pretension. The viewer does, however, sympathise with Lao Li&#8217;s wife.<br />\n(2 stars - Aleena Glentis; November 2, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Middle classes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Divorce", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2195884, "name": "Fu Dehai", "creator_id": 82827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2195881, "name": "Sun Yong", "creator_id": 82826, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2195877, "name": "Wang Haowei", "creator_id": 34751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2195872, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2195902, "name": "Liu Xiaodong", "creator_id": 82829, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2195897, "name": "Li Chensheng", "creator_id": 82828, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2195893, "name": "Wang Haowei", "creator_id": 34751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2195887, "name": "Li Chensheng", "creator_id": 82828, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146476", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [55322], "external_references": []}, {"id": 89094, "acmi_id": "311741", "title": "Division of human tumor cells = Teilung von menschlichen tumorzellen", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "division-of-human-tumor-cells-teilung-von-menschlichen-tumorzellen", "creator_credit": "H.

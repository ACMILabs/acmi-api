Set in Hong Kong, 1920, the wealthy Sir Stephen is owner of a casino and living in delightful decadence, indulging in a multitude of amorous experiences. Stephen persuades his wife O to join him there and work in a brothel, as a means of demonstrating her love for him. Once there she is exposed to all manner of sexual peccadillos and perversions, frequently enacted whilst Stephen watches. Stephen embarks upon an affair with another woman, whilst O finds a new love of her own, challenging their marriage. &#8220;The Fruits of passion&#8221; is art-house fare that dabbles in soft porn, with a political backdrop. Although it toys with the themes of fidelity and eroticism, the film tends toward misogyny and spends an inordinate amount of time on the sexual proclivities of its protagonists but little on their mental states or emotional motivations. Based on the novel by Pauline Reage (aka Dominique Aury), who wrote the erotic classic, &#8220;The Story of O&#8221;.

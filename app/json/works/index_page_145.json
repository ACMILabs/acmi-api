The Church regards his art as sinful, blasphemous and morally damaging. Lindsay is living on a large property in bohemian bliss with his wife (Pamela Rabe), children and models. An English preacher Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant) is sent to Lindsay&#8217;s property to try to dissuade him from continuing to paint and draw in his current style. Campion&#8217;s wife Estella (Tara Fitzgerald), who accompanies Anthony on this trip, is sexually frustrated and bored with her marriage. The sirens of the title (Elle Macpherson, Portia de Rossi and Kate Fischer) cavort semi-clad for much of their time at the artist&#8217;s house and studio, causing the sexual tension between Anthony and Estella, to rise. Estella experiences extensive erotic dreams featuring the sirens and various men she has encountered. &#8220;Sirens&#8221; features a famed scene where the five main women of the film are shown naked atop a mountain range.

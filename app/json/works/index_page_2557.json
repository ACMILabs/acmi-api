When two girls are strangled with a G-string, the police point the finger at various crew members including Daisy and Biff (Michael O&#8217;Shea), a comic with designs on Daisy. Stanwyck plays Daisy as a tough-as-nails no-nonsense broad with enough chutzpah to carry the show, whose dialogue at times has a Howard Hawks-esque quality. This is a well-mounted independent production by a veteran ex-Metro producer with an authentic backstage atmosphere and directed at a fast pace by Wellman. Stanwyck sings &#8220;Take it off the E-string, Play it on the G-string&#8221; while dancing a &#8216;strip&#8217; number. Also features: J. Edward Bromberg, Charles Dingle, and Frank Conroy.

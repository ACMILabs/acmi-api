Though the characters may be lethargic, the film is definitely not. &#8220;Praise&#8221; is in many ways an era-defining Australian film, accurately portraying and examining the contemporary landscape of heterosexual love and the blurring of traditional gender roles and emotional states. Featuring stand-out performances by Peter Fenton and Sacha Horler in the main roles (Horler won the AFI for Best Actress for her portrayal), &#8220;Praise&#8221; is a moving love story about the instability of love. Like the book it is based on, &#8220;Praise&#8221; features characters who may be sexually dysfunctional (Gordon ejaculates prematurely) and physically far from the Hollywood ideal (Cynthia suffers from eczema), but they are treated with respect and with affection.

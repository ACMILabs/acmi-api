The inspiration for the work is a tune of the same name - a musical illustration, an imaginary vision of old Shanghai, Chinese metropolis, and International Settlement, conjuring mythic, filmic, musical and personal images of the city port. The &#8216;Strange cities&#8217; musical score1 written by Alexander Vertinsky, Serge Ermoll and Ira Bloch, was first performed by a jazz orchestra of White Russian emigres in the cabarets of the International Settlement of Shanghai, China in the 1930&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s. &#8216;Strange cities&#8217; draws upon the legacy of the Shanghai milieu, the Chinese gangster film, a musical cabaret genre, orientalist erotic literature, intrigue novels, and the films of Josef von Sternberg. Coined capital of the international underworld, the city of Shanghai became a seductively strange locale symbolized in the Western imagination, in reality the city was most often the final port of call for political refugees.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Creator: Tatiana Pentes<br />\nOriginal musical score: Serge Ermoll (Sergei Emolaeff) and Alexander Vertinsky<br />\nCo-development &amp; Cinematography: Geoffrey James Weary<br />\nProducer: Eurydice Aroney<br />\nSound Design: Roi Huberman<br />\nInterface Design and Programming: Glenn Remington</p>", "details": [{"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Russian"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2710173, "name": "Tatiana Pentes", "creator_id": 7125, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120700024", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2710174, "name": "Tatiana Pentes", "creator_id": 7125, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120700024", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2710176, "name": "Eurydice Aroney", "creator_id": 7126, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2710175, "name": "Tatiana Pentes", "creator_id": 7125, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120700024", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "CD ROM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "499", "eaas_environment_id": "8b731667-ccd3-45d2-897e-7aaf4438aa6c", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [47741]}, {"id": 108245, "acmi_id": "B1001954", "title": "In My Gash", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-my-gash", "creator_credit": "Linda Dement", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>&#8220;She had a bad childhood.

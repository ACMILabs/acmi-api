Unrelenting deadpan delivery confirms the melancholic tone of the film but dilutes the emotional content contained within a wry and savvy script. Whilst the characters&#8217; physical surrounds are well captured (with some sumptuously shot interiors), the emotional core that drives Enid, and especially Becky is not.

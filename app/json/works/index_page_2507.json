Tracks include &#8220;Let the good times roll&#8221;, &#8220;Yesterday&#8221;, &#8220;Shake&#8221; and &#8220;I can&#8217;t stop loving you&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Israel - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jerusalem - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jews - Social life and customs", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Big band music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Charles, Ray, 1930-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Concerts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Piano", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Soul music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Women singers", "People&nbsp;→ Charles, Ray, 1930-", "People&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930326, "name": "Marco Sadde", "creator_id": 37290, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930325, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53181", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [34625], "external_references": []}, {"id": 77192, "acmi_id": "015410", "title": "Raw nerves", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "raw-nerves", "creator_credit": "Manuel De Landa", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A parody of &#8216;film noir&#8217; conventions which also employs narration, private eye style, and video graphics to transform the narrative into apparently farcical psycho-drama.

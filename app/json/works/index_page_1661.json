Tibet is full of  military vehicles, all manned by ethnic Han Chinese. The beginning of this film is a curious one, which confronts the woman doctor with a festive group watching as young men play a shooting game. However, that is the most that the Chinese film is prepared to alight on that topic…</p>\n<p>This newly graduated woman doctor needs to get to the provincial town of Saitang to help the sick and needy, but the next bus is days from now. She decides to approach the liberation army for a ride from on a military supply vehicle. Walking through the rows of army trucks parked beside the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) barracks, she finds a gruff Chinese platoon leader and propositions him (for a ride).</p>\n<p>The platoon leader — who has been having a rough time with his missus back in Beijing — refuses on the pretext of being superstitious of taking women into the highlands. Long story short, her determination ends up getting her a lift anyway. Her two travel companions are the platoon leader and a younger more naive recruit, optimistic and unfamiliar with the harsh wilderness of Tibet.</p>\n<p>Platoon leader sees life as being like an endless trek through the wilderness, fuelled only by a strong will, and the occasional drop of hard liquor. Despite the tough going there are absolutely beautiful shots of the countryside, with its verdant forests and pristine mountainscapes</p>\n<p>On their way they discover an old man who has come down with a bad case of malaria in the forest and decide to take him along. It turns out the man is a hunter, not used to company. He is rude, uncooth and presumptuous toward young Tibetan women: Not the kind of awkward company our female hero wants to be stuck in the back of a truck with.

Why don&#8217;t you tell me about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This eventually leads them to incorporate contemporary methods into the musical tradition of the Bian Zhong in order to draw popular attention to traditional Chinese music. They then reproduce a Bian Zhong according to an original antique and set out on a journey of rediscovery, covering half of China in search of  ancient artifacts to act as data and reference materials to use for their upcoming shows.</p>\n<p>Watching how the modern Chinese interpret ancient lifestyle is the most interesting facet of the film. The dance movements, for instance, are often developed from the symbolism of the total submission of the slaves to the aristocratic class. There also seem to be fairly explicit sexual undertones in the movements (which is common to dance choreography, but worth noting nonetheless). The pivotal movement is supposed to tire out the whole body in just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Each of the artists experience their own labours in reestablishing a connection with this ancient culture, but it seems that it is partly through that hardship that they experience an intimacy with their roots and the creation that blossoms from their own experience, and the tradition they are portraying.</p>\n<p>Instead of following the traditional themes that centred around kings and lords, most songs are of the common people, such as the National Morurning Song, which the Chu people sang for their fallen warriors. Here we see no representation of great deeds, but the sorrow of a people left behind.</p>\n<p>Other songs include those of; drought and natural disasters; a &#8216;Dance of the Sacrificial Rites&#8217; and &#8216;the God of Spring Dong Huang&#8217;(lit. &#8216;Emperor of the East&#8217;,  东皇)</p>\n<p>They basically have to go back to the provinces to rediscover the preserved traditions of the Chinese people.

To celebrate the engagement, Angelo and Silvia&#8217;s families are to come together for a grand lunch at the home of her parents. As the wine flows and the sumptious meal is consumed, family secrets and resentments come to the surface and threaten the young couple&#8217;s happiness. Set in the thirties, the rigid codes which govern peasant life are already beginning to become undone: Mussolini is beginning his ascendancy; the dictates of family honour and fidelity are being defied; the centuries old division between poor and the rich is being questioned. But for Angelo and Silvia, caught up in the passion of their love, everything else is secondary.

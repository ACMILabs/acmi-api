Made by two student filmmakers, they travel to Mongolia to meet a family of three generations living a simple nomadic lifestyle. During the spring, one of the family&#8217;s camels has a difficult delivery, giving birth to a rare white colt but she then rejects the youngster. Two family members set off to fetch a musician who plays a violin-like stringed instrument. The musician and a female family member perform a simple ritual that will re-unite the mother camel with her young. Striking landscape vistas and moving insight into the nomadic family life are captured by Luigi Falorni&#8217;s cinematography in this poignant representation of folklore and traditional storytelling.

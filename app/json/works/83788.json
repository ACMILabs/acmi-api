Doug Dooligan has lost count of the number of times he&#8217;s heard that phrase. Nineteen years old and on parole all he wants to do is get on with his life, away from the influence of his best friend Floyd &#8220;Pretty Boy&#8221; Davies. Doug wants to get a job, save some money and buy back his father&#8217;s property, Yetticup, the land of his people&#8217;s Dreaming. Floyd wants his old partner in crime to join him in &#8220;bigger and better things&#8221;. Floyd thinks Doug&#8217;s decision to go straight means that he is giving up on his &#8220;blackfella&#8221; lifestyle and being a &#8220;whitefella&#8221;. Doug is half white and is torn between his love for Floyd and his family obligations. The pressures of friendship, family, identity and blackfella versus whitefella lifestyles, almost jeopardise Doug&#8217;s chances of achieving his dream. He goes back to his old ways, but unexpectedly the tables turn and it is Floyd who acts to save Doug&#8217;s dream, and give him hope for the future. BLACKFELLAS is based on the book &#8220;Day of the dog&#8221; by Archie Weller, a Perth writer who grew up with the Nyoongah people from the Perth area and James Ricketson, the writer/director of BLACKFELLAS, consulted extensively with the Nyoongah community during the development of the script. It is a moving and powerful study of Aboriginal society which is shown from an insider&#8217;s perspective, producing a sensitive and compassionate drama.

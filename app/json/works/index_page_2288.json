In Italian with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Fellini&#8217;s personal vision of Rome mixes travelogue, nostalgia fantasy, comedy and documentary. Inspired by his remembrances of his childhood and his sharp observations about contemporary Roman life in the seventies, the film fondly lingers over the &#8220;Felliniesque&#8221; carnival of characters populating family dinners, theater audiences, brothels, and street parties. Fellini turns Rome&#8217;s Catholic ritualism into an opulent ecclesiastical fashion show, while the subway construction sequence and the final, nocturnal tour of the ruins via motorcycle find surreal beauty in the potentially destructive juxtaposition of ancient and modern Rome. Cast includes Peter Gonzales, Fiona Florence, Marni Maitland, Anna Magnani, Federico Fellini and Gore Vidal.

Miserable over the separation of his parents, he mopes around town, unable to comprehend their actions.

Although Songsong appears concerned, his father reassures him that he&#8217;s a big boy who can take care of himself. He warns him not to go to the hospital while he&#8217;s gone.</p>\n<p>The next day, as Songsong walks home with a female classmate (who is the daughter of the schoolteacher), they pass the people&#8217;s court. Visibly upset by the sight, he tells her that adults who quarrel and breakup go to court and never live together again. &#8220;Never let your parents go there&#8221;, he warns her. Songsong&#8217;s childlike understanding of the world, it seems, is unable to wrap its head around the concept of divorce.</p>\n<p>The next day, despite his father&#8217;s orders, Songsong visits the hospital, where we learn that his mother works. She is surprised to see him, but nevertheless gives him a warm embrace and shows concern for his apparent sadness. They spend the day out, and she takes him to a toy store. Songsong appears happier with his mother, who gives him the attention and affection he desires. Songsong tells his mother that he is miserable without her and scared at home on his own, but she reassures him that he can visit whenever he likes.</p>\n<p>Songsong&#8217;s father returns, and is angry to discover that he disobeyed his order not to visit his mother.

When the friend suggests that he hide the fact that he has a son until she falls in love with him and is forced to accept it, Songsong is shown awake in bed, eavesdropping on their upsetting conversation. They agree to meet her the following day.</p>\n<p>The next morning Songsong wakes with the flu, and his father insists that he stay home from school. When Liu Chunhua arrives, Songsong is forced to hide upstairs, despite his raging fever. Songsong asks his father if he will remarry. He explains that he is trying to find him a new mother.</p>\n<p>Songsong&#8217;s teacher, witnessing the effects of his parents&#8217; divorce on the boy, seeks out his mother, and begs her to reconcile with her husband for the sake of their child.

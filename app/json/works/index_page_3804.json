This work assesses the mood of the times, or &#8220;Cool Britannia&#8221; as it was known, and the reasons why it was, for a while, great to be British; also addresses the role that Tony Blair and New Labor played, throwing off the drudgery of Thatcherism, embracing all that was new and youthful; and the band war between Oasis and Blur, played out on the pages on NME. Consisting almost entirely of interviews, the filmmakers have enhanced classic raw material with jazzy and judicious editing. From the insightful to the ridiculous, this is far from an exhaustive piece, but it provides an astute and witty snapshot of the times.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Culture", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ London (England) - Social life and customs", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Culture", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Politics and government", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blur (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Culture", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Electronic music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Massive Attack (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Oasis (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "People&nbsp;→ Blur (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "People&nbsp;→ Massive Attack (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Oasis (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930490, "name": "John Dower", "creator_id": 81231, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q76195716", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1808362, "name": "John Battsek", "creator_id": 81230, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6221119", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930485, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930486, "name": "Film Council", "creator_id": 35985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930487, "name": "Horsebridge Productions", "creator_id": 81229, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337288", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930488, "name": "Passion Pictures", "creator_id": 31862, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7142727", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930484, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

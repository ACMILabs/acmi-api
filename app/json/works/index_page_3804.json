Midway into the season the &#8216;big bad&#8217;, Adam, is revealed as being an &#8216;initiative&#8217; experiment gone wrong (shades of Frankenstein echo throughout the season). Considered one of the more difficult years by fans, Whedon and his band of writers fashioned a more mature season that saw the gang entering into more emotionally complex terrain, as the realities of college life and adulthood threatened to split their friendships apart. The season curiously ended with a stand alone episode which hinted at difficult times ahead for the slayer. (ep. 66 Restless).

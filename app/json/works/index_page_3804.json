Barry Sonnenfeld&#8217;s innovatiove cinematography, (also seen in the Coens&#8217; later films &#8216;Rasing Arizona&#8217; and &#8216;Miller&#8217;s Crossing&#8217;) adds to this distinctive mix.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/blood-simple", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1809608, "name": "Ethan Coen", "creator_id": 58123, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q13595531", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951858, "name": "River Road Productions", "creator_id": 25930, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951860, "name": "Joel Coen", "creator_id": 58122, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q13595311", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951857, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39734", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [23295], "external_references": [{"id": 1927, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q237222"}, {"id": 3658, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11368"}]}, {"id": 99235, "acmi_id": "509394", "title": "Blood on the wattle", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blood-on-the-wattle", "creator_credit": "Michael Berry and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1988", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Hypothetical (Television Program)&#8221;.<br />\nFocuses on the importance and relevance of the Australian Constitution to its citizens.

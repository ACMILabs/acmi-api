Although the threads of continuity in the plot are explicit, in tone this is not really a sequel but a macabre comedy, an excursion into the fantastic which hovers between expressionism and surrealism. Karloff&#8217;s monster is the only sympathetic character. The mad scientist, Dr. Pretorius, seems to take over the evil presumptions of Frankenstein. As originally conceived, the heart of Frankenstein&#8217;s bride, Elizabeth, was to have been implanted in the she-monster. This makes more sense of the title and the she-monster&#8217;s behaviour. Suggested by the original story written in 1816 by Mary Wollstonecroft Shelley. Also includes a comprehensive documentary detailing various aspects of the production, including music, make-up, and behind-the-scenes information.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-bride-of-frankenstein", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995018, "name": "James Whale", "creator_id": 48075, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381831", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995017, "name": "Carl Laemmle", "creator_id": 59963, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q61074", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995016, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48294", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1935", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1935"}], "labels": [30464]}]}

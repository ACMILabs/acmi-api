Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This film follows the Penington family on a camping trip around Lake Eildon, Victoria, which starts and finishes in Melbourne. There are a number of staged scenes of the family and titles throughout informing where scenes are being taken.</p>\n<p>The film begins with the title ‘Where my caravan has rested’ and follows with a map of Victoria drawing out the route taken.</p>\n<p>Much of the trip shows scenes of different rivers including the Goulburn River, Delatite River, Jamieson River and Howqua River.</p>\n<p>Places visited include Seymour, Alexandra, Rubicon, Eildon Weir, Jamieson, Woods Point and Mt Buller.</p>\n<p>Much of the film is scenic and shows many scenes of flowering wattle trees. Beautiful distant scenes of Mt Buller and Mt Torbreck can be seen.</p>\n<p>Of possible interest are scenes of the Rubicon Hydroelectric pipeline and power station and the Eildon Weir hydro power station.</p>\n<p>The film ends with the garage doors closing on the Penington family car with the word ‘HOME’ revealed.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 title ‘Where my Caravan has

The film is a biographical study of Pan&#8217;s entry into the world of dance, his arrival in Hollywood, and his work with a variety of filmmakers, actors and dancers. Ultimately, it is also a tribute to his contribution to musical film history as the documentary was completed very shortly before his death. Also featuring discussion about and footage of dance greats such as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth, Kim Novak, Bob Fosse, Ann Miller, Carol Haney, Elizabeth Taylor, Cyd Charisse and Hermes Pan himself in rare motion picture appearances, the documentary is a personalised insight into the Hollywood musical era with reflective commentary from Pan in the presentation of its archival contents.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Astaire, Fred, 1899-1987", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Hollywood (Los Angeles, Calif.) - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Choreography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - United States", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ Astaire, Fred, 1899-1987", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "Short films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 814448, "name": "RM Arts", "creator_id": 22905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814449, "name": "Clara Films", "creator_id": 34859, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814450, "name": "Gerard Paquet", "creator_id": 34860, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814451, "name": "Robert Kuperberg", "creator_id": 34861, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 814447, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50703", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [32668]}, {"id": 66576, "acmi_id": "002607", "title": "Dance chromatic (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dance-chromatic-tefc", "creator_credit": "Evergreen Films and Ed Emshwiller", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Emshwiller&#8217;s first completed film.

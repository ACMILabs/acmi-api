Attention to detail in dress and decor (and Vivaldi&#8217;s music), was important to this shift in style. Renoir saw his film not as drama, farce or burlesque but as a &#8216;sort of irony that I tried to combine with the light-headedness one finds, for example, in Goldini [an 18th century Italian comic dramatist].&#8217; He saw the period and the subject as theatrical so he structured the film like a three act play with the acting &#8216;a little exaggerated &#8230; a confusion of theatre and life&#8217;. Renoir diverted Magnani&#8217;s &#8216;ultra-romantic, naturalistic style&#8217; into the mix of spontaneity and classicism central to the commedia dell&#8217;arte.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Francesco Alliata ; director, Jean Renoir ; writers, Jean Renoir, Jack Kirkland, Renzo Avanzo, Giulio Macchi ; photography, Claude Renoir ; music, Antonio Vivaldi.<br />\nCast: Anna Magnani, Duncan Lamont, Paul Campbell, Riccardo Rioli, Odoardo Spadaro.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890998, "name": "Jean Renoir", "creator_id": 17563, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q50713", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1806202, "name": "Francesco Alliata", "creator_id": 83242, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1440892", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146965", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1952", "notes": "", "to_year": "1952"}], "labels": [55727]}, {"id": 116232, "acmi_id": "X000432", "title": "Pot-Bouille = House of Lovers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "pot-bouille-house-of-lovers", "creator_credit": "Julien Duvivier, Raymond Hakim and Robert Hakim", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1957", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 2809, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3399892"}], "brief_description": "<p>Penniless Octave Mouret arrives in Paris at the turn of the Century to take up a job as assistant in a draper shop run by Madame Hedouin.

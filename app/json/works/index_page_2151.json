The two are diametrically different in appearance, attitude towards life, family and friends, and most significantly in relation towards men and Sandrine; a comatose young girl (Sandrine&#8217;s mother owns the flat that Isa and Marie are minding). There are moments of real happiness between the two, and the initial stages of their friendship as it develops is captured beautifully, allowing the viewer to absorb the expressions of each girl and speculate about character development. Their paths soon begin to diverge however - unbalancing their friendship, when Marie becomes involved in a self destructive relationship with night club owner Chris (Gregoire Colin), and Isa starts to visit Sandrine after finding the girl&#8217;s diary and becoming privy to her innermost thoughts. As the friends drift further away from one another, they are both faced with situations that challenge them and influence their future both as individuals, and as friends.

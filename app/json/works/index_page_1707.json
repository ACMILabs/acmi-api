Japan&#8217;s campaign was defeated in 1945, marking the end of World War II, and China&#8217;s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. After a further four years, 1950 saw a cessation of major hostilities—with the newly founded People&#8217;s Republic of China controlling mainland China, and the Republic of China&#8217;s jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan (and its surrounding islands).

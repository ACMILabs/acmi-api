Bradman&#8217;s test match career was an outstanding example of sporting brilliance; his career total of runs was 6,996 with an average of 99.9, including 29 centuries. Aggression, initiative and improvisation were the hallmarks of his playing and this footage, filmed on the London Cricket Ground in 1934, captures his style perfectly, shows the complete shot and stroke broken down into successive movements and as such provides an invaluable visual description of how to achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiency of movements when batting in a game.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Bradman, Donald, Sir, 1908-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket - Australia", "People&nbsp;→ Bradman, Donald, Sir, 1908-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783874, "name": "Bradman Museum", "creator_id": 26056, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 783873, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39856", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [23410]}, {"id": 68647, "acmi_id": "321437", "title": "How to play cricket", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "how-to-play-cricket", "creator_credit": "Herschells Films, Featurettes and Victor M.

At the time when gold was being mined there several townships were flourishing but these are largely abandoned. The Mitchell River Mission looks after aborigines of the district who are free to come and go as they please, and some are employed on the cattle runs in the area. At the waterholes may be seen large flocks of ibis and many other birds as well as wild pigs and crocodiles.

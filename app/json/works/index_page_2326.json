The binary conflicts between tradition and freedom, affluence and contentment, youth and age are reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 1940s.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Alcohol use", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/arthur-1981", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2100580, "name": "Steve Gordon", "creator_id": 80303, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5506633", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2100579, "name": "Robert Greenhut", "creator_id": 46855, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2157353", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2100575, "name": "Orion Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 9553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2100571, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51054", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [32989]}, {"id": 93483, "acmi_id": "316930", "title": "And justice for all [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "and-justice-for-all-dvd", "creator_credit": "Norman Jewison, Patrick Palmer and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1979", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 48150, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q426517"}], "brief_description": "<p>Al Pacino plays Arthur Kirkland, an attorney who experiences firsthand corruption of the establishment that he works for.

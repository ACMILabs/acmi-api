Piccoli puts this theory to the test with the staff of the hotel where he is staying and is dismayed to find barely any recognition of names from French film history or even classic movies such as &#8216;La regle du jeu&#8217;. Set in Munich, in a magnificent new Kinemathek opened to celebrate the first century of cinema, &#8216;Night of the Filmmakers&#8217; (54 mins, 1994) imagines an assembly of German filmmakers such that only the artifice of film could bring together, attempting to find answers to questions such as, what exactly makes a German film German?

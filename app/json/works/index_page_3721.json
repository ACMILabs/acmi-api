Accepting the potentialities of the medium to manipulate both time and space, he brings past and present head-on as he regards with adult feelings his childhood, family and friends. Grown-ups romp like children, and by their magnified infantilism playfully underscore such basic traits as sadism, sensuality and egocentricity. While mother tuns out to be the biggest infant of them all, blindly holding to her ideal of beauty, blind to its disastrous effect upon her entire family. The undertones of this film are disturbing and Broughton has knowingly added to that sense of disturbance by introducing into it a range of objects that appear symbolic. Broughton, however, attempts to expose the audience to a total visual experience, that is poetic and not merely a mystic maze of hidden symbolic meanings. This exploration of an artist&#8217;s world of memory, imagination and perception is among the most challenging experimental films produced in America during this period.

Like the companion films Custody and Malpractice this is a cautionary tale in the form of docu-drama, offering no easy answers or simplified dramatic conflict, instead seeking to create a sense of lived experience while dramatising the issues involved. The key characters are played by actors with architects, solicitors and government services officials playing themselves. Cast includes Doris Younane, Brian Vriends, Bruce Venables and Andrew Gilbert.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Docudrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Home ownership", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 773087, "name": "Bill Bennett", "creator_id": 22480, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4908103", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1804311, "name": "Bruce Moir", "creator_id": 15569, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299193", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 773085, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 773084, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36593", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [20261]}]}

Europe displays a surprising wealth of wildlife and natural beauty despite its small size, high population density, and intense industrialization. Students will observe Europe&#8217;s long, irregular coastline, from Norway&#8217;s fjords to the Black Sea. They will travel to some to some of Europe&#8217;s many peninsulas and islands and appreciate the continent&#8217;s close links with the sea. They will learn about the effects of the sea on climate and natural vegetation. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students.

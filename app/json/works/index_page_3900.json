Gifted young guitarist Eugene (Ralph Maccio) will do anything to play the blues like his legendary hero and travels across country where he meets the now old and cantankerous Willie. Together they journey to the fated crossroads and Eugene learns that to really play the blues, you must live them first. Joe Seneca and Jami Gertz also star in this production which features an incredible soundtrack by Ry Cooder.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954000, "name": "Walter Hill", "creator_id": 71303, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953999, "name": "Mark Carliner", "creator_id": 77905, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953998, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953997, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18196, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/jSx2NtVcy3PJST6YHefNdxw5euZ.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Crossroads (Walter Hill) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41307", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [24806]}]}

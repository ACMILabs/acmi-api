She has a sick little girl who wants &#8220;an orange&#8221; more than anything- how times have changed. The dog goes through Hell to get the orange, fighting all sorts of weird demons, other puppets, and Satan himself!

Puppets are modelled on Charlie Chaplin, Tom Mix and Mary Pickford. &#8216;The Tale of the Fox&#8217; (1931, 65 mins): Starewicz&#8217; epic took over 10 years to finish. It is based on Goethe&#8217;s Reineke Fuchs, and film reviewers of the time said it was beyond any animated film ever attempted, in fact, it approached poetry.

Shot over the full twelve weeks of their basic training course, this documentary is a graphically accurate portrayal of the process of military indoctrination which tests the women both physically and mentally. Although they came from both urban and country environments, the recruits were united by their desire to make something of their lives.

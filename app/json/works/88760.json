But before the Goodies can become rich, they must battle with the Giant. Note: this is the 43 minute Christmas version. Guest stars Michael Aspel. THE END: The office is entombed under a pillar of concrete in line with Graeme&#8217;s new city development plan. Isolated, the Goodies explore their relationships with each other, politics, religion and eye-spy. THE BUNFIGHT AT THE O.K.

Graeme monopolises the cream business by sneaking off on the other two, but Tim and Bill also find strawberry jam and scones.

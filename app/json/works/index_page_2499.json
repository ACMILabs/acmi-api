Malcolm X was initially a small-time crim who converted to Islam and became a central figure in the the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. A passionate and dynamic speaker, his vehement condemnation of race relations fightened and incensed many white Americans. The film faithfully follows Malcolm X&#8217;s life: his poor childhood and violent early adulthood, his prison years, his involvement in the Nation of Islam and the Civil Rights Movement, and the lead-up to his assassination. Though a long film of the epic genre, Spike Lee&#8217;s direction is colourful and well-paced, and some of the sequences are dazzling, including the pilgrimmage to Mecca. Spike Lee was the first Western filmmaker allowed to film in the Holy City. &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221; reclaims, with passion and dignity, the life of a controversial but inspiring man. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X and Angela Bassett plays his wife. Cast alson includes Al Freeman Jr, Albert Hall, Delroy Lindo.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:20:55:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Assassination", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans - Civil rights", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Assassination", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Civil rights - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Islam", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Assassination", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History - 1945-", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ X, Malcolm, 1925-1965"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 81}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1988248, "name": "Spike Lee", "creator_id": 72793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51566", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988246, "name": "Marvin Worth", "creator_id": 25267, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3850417", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988247, "name": "Spike Lee", "creator_id": 72793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51566", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988245, "name": "40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks", "creator_id": 25237, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988244, "name": "Largo Entertainment", "creator_id": 26493, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q17346576", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1988243, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40515", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [24052]}, {"id": 84561, "acmi_id": "305883", "title": "Fahrenheit 451", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fahrenheit-451", "creator_credit": "Francois Truffaut, Lewis M.

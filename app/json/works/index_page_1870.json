The sheer number of people made it the biggest example of forced migration. Accompanying a tour of African Americans tracing their painful past, this documentary postulates that the Trans-Atlantic slave trade was only made possible by the existence of a prolific slave trade already in Africa. This resulted in the formation of mutually beneficial partnerships between Europeans and Africans. Europe and America would benefit in the long term from the arrangement, but West Africa would be left with little, only a guilt which is often not acknowledged.

When Hua’s husband Jin Lingtong tells Ma that they sell their art, but not their bodies, Ma redirects his derision, insisting that Jin must perform songs at his request.

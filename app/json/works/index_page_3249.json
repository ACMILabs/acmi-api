The characters - the evil banker, his innocent daughter, Judex the invisible avenger, the comic detective, the adventuress and the beautiful acrobat - are derived directly from the serial and full of improbable twists and turns. The magical clash between good and evil provides the pretext for poetic symbolism and surreal set pieces such as the murder at the masked ball, filmed in the contrasty black and white photography of early cinema.

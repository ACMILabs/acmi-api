Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program.

There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically.

Modern gambling relies on the gambler&#8217;s willingness to take a chance. Ep. 1. Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program. Gambling it seems has no limit to a person&#8217;s behaviour and just how far they are willing to go - some even to the point of death. Mark &#8220;Chopper&#8221; Read talks of his &#8220;rush&#8221; when he plays Russian Roulette, others get their excitement from betting on &#8220;dares&#8221; and playing weird games for money.

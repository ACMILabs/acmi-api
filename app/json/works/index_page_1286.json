This outstanding success in 1976 culminated in the announcement that Stevie Wonder was the recipient of Album of the Year at the Grammys, as well as being named Producer of the Year and Best Male Vocal Performer. The remarkable story behind this phenomenally successful year for Wonder is told here as he reminisces about the inspiration behind the album.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Wonder, Stevie", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Wonder, Stevie"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1533035, "name": "David Heffernan", "creator_id": 29764, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1533034, "name": "Bous De Jong", "creator_id": 29771, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1533033, "name": "Daniel Television", "creator_id": 29762, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1533032, "name": "Isis Productions", "creator_id": 29765, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1533031, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

This is very much a stage play on film with not a lot of cinematic expression or extravagant landscapes, confined most of the time to the living room scenes of the house where Stevie and her Aunt dwell. However, it is the literary merit and the art of language which perhaps give this film its appeal, not to mention the excellent performances by some of Britain&#8217;s most highly acclaimed actors.

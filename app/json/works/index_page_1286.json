Animated diagrams show how the oil under pressure tends to migrate through the rocks, until it either finds its way through to the surface or is trapped in one of the formations for which oil-seekers look.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Oil fields", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Earth", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geological time", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology, Stratigraphic", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Oil fields", "Documentary", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth - Origin", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth sciences", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geological time", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology, Stratigraphic", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Metamorphism (Geology)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Netherlands"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 849265, "name": "Shell Film Unit", "creator_id": 12202, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849266, "name": "Sir Arthur Hallam Elton", "creator_id": 13679, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849267, "name": "Bert Haanstra", "creator_id": 13334, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21552", "production_places": [{"id": 15, "name": "Netherlands", "slug": "netherlands"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [5440]}, {"id": 65950, "acmi_id": "001895", "title": "The Changing cotton land: USA - the southeast", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-changing-cotton-land-usa-the-southeast", "creator_credit": "United World Films, Louis De Rochemont and Bill Colleran", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1949", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1949-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Earth and it&#8217;s peoples&#8221;.<br />\nIn this section of southeast America, cotton and tobacco have depleted the soil over a long period of time and the damage done is now being slowly repaired. new crops and new industries are being introduced.

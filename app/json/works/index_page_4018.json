Liebovitz is filmed at work on various photo shoots with a focus on sequences surrounding her most compelling images such as the 1977 concert tour with the Rolling Stones, her cover photo of Yoko Ono and John Lennon taken shortly before his death in 1980, and the controversial 1993 cover shot of a naked and pregnant Demi Moore. Through such wide ranging material the program traces the progression and turning points of her life and work and the stylistic visions which signify particular points in her career. It provides a thorough survey on and insight into this major photographer, her documentation of American youth culture, politics, celebrity culture and her own professional and personal aims and achievements.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Photography, Journalistic", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Commercial photography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photographers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photographers - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photographs - Psychological aspects", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography - History", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography - Social aspects - History", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography, Artistic", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography, Journalistic", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Women photographers", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Photography - Social aspects - History", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Watergate Affair, 1972-1974", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Lennon, John, 1940-1980", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ono, Yoko, 1933-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rolling Stones (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "People&nbsp;→ Jagger, Mick", "People&nbsp;→ Lennon, John, 1940-1980", "People&nbsp;→ Ono, Yoko, 1933-", "People&nbsp;→ Rolling Stones (Musical group)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816083, "name": "Belinda Allen", "creator_id": 34236, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812016, "name": "LWT", "creator_id": 27631, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812017, "name": "RM Arts", "creator_id": 22905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812019, "name": "Rebecca Frayn", "creator_id": 34237, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 812015, "name": "Bookwise", "creator_id": 79740, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50073", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [32082], "external_references": []}]}

The consistently underlit or nocturnal mise-en-scene, the ubiquitous rain, and the seedy urban locations are all reminiscent of classic Hollywood film noir. But it is above all in the knowing characterisation of the detective hero that the genre is most evident. In both actions and appearance, Simon is a hyperbolic version of the crumpled private eye. He narrates his own story with the laconic humour typical of the genre.

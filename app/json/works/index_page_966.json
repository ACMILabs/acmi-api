It has the stenciled triangle with the 1888 date as well as &#8220;Paragon&#8221; on the front which both sides have wear but these are actually harder to find with the painted stenciled lettering on it. The reel is full but a couple of the slides are broken but still for display purposes on a shelf looks alright. The body is the blued steel look which depending on the lighting either shows the blue look or more towards black if the lighting is bad. The front lens does extend with the turn knob and also retracts. The front lens &amp; condensor lens are good just need a proper cleaning like the rest of this. The wood base does have some scratches which if someone were to use a stain pen you could probably fix those spots up pretty quick. Overall &#8220;G&#8221; good condition as seen with wear. The rails on this one are a brass color which the later models were just nickel plated. In back is no burner which it had been electrified so that old unit was thrown away.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Pettibone Paragon (Peacock) Magic Lantern Projector</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Pettibone Mfg.

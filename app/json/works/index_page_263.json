In this work Moore addresses the problem of violence in America, focusing on gun culture, the prevalence of gun ownership and the sanctity of the American right to bear arms. Moore&#8217;s approach is to interview a variety of people attempting to depict a tapestry that may explain America&#8217;s relationship to guns. Among his interviewees are student survivors of the 1999 Columbine school massacre, National Rifle Association spokesperson and actor, Charlton Heston, politicians, police and various gun enthusiasts. Moore tries to dispel myths that are propagated as an explanation as to why American society is so at war with itself - its bloody history, the volume of guns amid the population, violence in the media, American&#8217;s preponderance for violent video games and films. Moore questions these theories by focusing on other less violent countries with these same qualities. One of Moore&#8217;s strongest theories is that the scare-mongering prevalent in society, broadcast through the media, and the popularity of reality TV shows, such as &#8220;COPS&#8221;, promotes the notion that danger is omnipresent to the individual and must be countered.

This intimate drama, shot in the beautiful light of a north Canadian winter, is powerfully acted by Ferguson and by Judy Davis as the mother. Simon&#8217;s growing awareness of his mother&#8217;s illness results in his alienation from the concerns of his fellow classmates, and he becomes close to an older boy who initiates him into the rites of adulthood. This Australian, Canadian and Italian co-production was nominated for 6 AFI awards including Best Film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Boarding schools", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Schizophrenia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 903883, "name": "Ellepi Films", "creator_id": 24475, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903884, "name": "Alliance Communications", "creator_id": 26863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903885, "name": "Rosa Colosimo Productions", "creator_id": 26828, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903886, "name": "Les Pescarolo", "creator_id": 77771, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903887, "name": "Elisa Resegotti", "creator_id": 77772, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903888, "name": "Antonio Tibaldi", "creator_id": 26866, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q98828309", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 903882, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40946", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [24465], "external_references": [{"id": 3210, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7091069"}]}, {"id": 71090, "acmi_id": "007838", "title": "On Mediterranean shores: Southern Greece", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "on-mediterranean-shores-southern-greece", "creator_credit": "Louis De Rochemont, Louis de Rochemont Associates and John Ferno", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1948", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1948-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Modern Greece, the end product of a civilisation 3000 years old, is a poor country.

Cast includes Albert Sinkys, Darlene Stuto, Helen McGara, Nike Zachmanoglou.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:16:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Women - Crimes against", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/ms-45", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1992335, "name": "Abel Ferrara", "creator_id": 29983, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262608", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992334, "name": "Navaron Films", "creator_id": 29982, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992333, "name": "Rochelle Films", "creator_id": 29981, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44671", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [27436]}, {"id": 87776, "acmi_id": "309859", "title": "Honey, I shrunk the kids", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "honey-i-shrunk-the-kids", "creator_credit": "Joe Johnston, Penney Finkelman Cox and Buena Vista Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46691, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1426248"}], "brief_description": "<p>A non-stop comedy adventure starring Rick Moranis as a preoccupied inventor who has created an electro-magnetic shrinking machine that is accidentally activated and shrinks his children to a minuscule size.

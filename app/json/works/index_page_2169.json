In April 1995, a public meeting was called to establish a survival plan. Attended by a hundred or so locals, the meeting produced a number of community initiatives including the developmentof a local phenomenon into a public festival.<br />\nIn the eight years since, the annual Christmas lights festival has grown into the most important event on Casterton&#8217;s social calender. Today, two thirds of all homes in Casterton are lit each Christmas with up to 10,000 visitors passing through the town each December to take part in the nightly lights tours run by the local Lions Club<br />\nCasterton Lights Up! is an independently produced community documentary project written, directed, produced and funded by Melbourne Based filmmaker Glen Moore.

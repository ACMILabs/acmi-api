Anchoring the narrative is Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) a ruthless American-born gang ruler with a merciless nature who delights in taunting immigrants. In an almighty showdown (with an array of killing apparatus used in hand-to-hand combat) Bill kills the honourable Irish Priest Vallon. Years later Vallon&#8217;s young son, Amsterdam, who witnesses the murder, seeks vengeance, even as he forms a bond with the charismatic Bill. A part of Amsterdam&#8217;s journey sees him romancing the free-spirited pickpocket Jenny (Cameron Diaz) and leading his own honourable &#8216;gang&#8217;, amid a climate of sanctioned corruption and overt racism. Scorsese&#8217;s eighteenth feature divided the critics in terms of its merit.

Ed thinks he sees an out when an entrepreneur seeks $10,000 to invest in a new idea - dry-cleaning. Ed extorts the money out of Big Dave - his wife&#8217;s boss, with whom she is having an affair. Instantaneously a tragic chain of events are set in motion culminating in murder, violence and the electric chair. Filmed in colour but processed in black and white, and shot by Coen brothers&#8217; regular Roger Deakins, the aesthetic is sumptuous, moody and seductive - noirish but with a distinctly Coen edge. What also sets the film apart is Thorton&#8217;s amazing performance as Ed, a unique character, disengaged from the gay 1950s consumerism that rages around him.

When the school has a talent contest to promote the fight against venereal disease, Mary has the opportunity she has dreamt of by competing for the joy of winning, and the prize of going to Hollywood (to play an extra). This charming film is a fantasy world of boys, dance, kissing, monologues from made for television films, as well as numerous film references. There is a fine supporting cast too in Mary&#8217;s special-ed class mates the wire mouthed strongwoman Helen (Emmy Laybourne), silent new boy in town Slater (Harland Williams), and Mary&#8217;s grandmother (Glynis Johns).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Croatian", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Bullying", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Bullying", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2318596, "name": "Bruce McCulloch", "creator_id": 80793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2926445", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2318595, "name": "Lorne Michaels", "creator_id": 30277, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q521221", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2318594, "name": "NBC Studios", "creator_id": 70503, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2318592, "name": "Superstar Productions USA", "creator_id": 36404, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2318590, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52330", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33920]}, {"id": 94412, "acmi_id": "318262", "title": "Twin Peaks.

This episode, directed by Lynch himself, ends with the much discussed surreal dream sequence where Agent Cooper encounters strange figures such as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man from Another Place and Laura Palmer herself.

The piece revolves around a mysterious notebook filled with obsessive listings of places, objects, and incidents which serve as the key to a hidden city. It is a city on unconsidered geographies and layered artefacts - the relics of low-level capitalism and the debris of countless forgotten narratives. The project stems from the filmmaker&#8217;s first job in New York - working as a pushcart vendor on Canal Street.

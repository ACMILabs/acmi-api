This documentary examines the experiences of a few of those men, as well as presenting the perspectives of the Canadian guards. Filmmaker Eva Colmers (a German-born resident of Canada) focuses on the story of her father - a POW who has fond memories of his time in captivity. If this seems disingenuous, it is through a series of interviews that he reveals that he was well fed, well treated and educated during his confinement. Of interest here is also the workings of a POW camp &#8212; how the men strictly adhered to their rank and values as soldiers, even remaining loyal to Hitler.

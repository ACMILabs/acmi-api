The slightest touch is all it takes to explode one of these deadly land mines. Than Khy was pregnant with her fifth child when she stepped on a mine buried just a few feet from her home. Miraculously, she and her daughter, now a year old, survived the blast, but Than lost a limb. However, Than is only one of around 300 victims a month, with 50% of this number who do not survive - a total of 60,000 mine casualties have been recorded in Cambodia upto 1995. Land mines are not only destroying but they are also devastating Cambodia&#8217;s economy. Large-scale agricultural activity cannot be revived without first removing the mines in the rural areas. Than Khy&#8217;s strength of mind and courage to get on with life is truly amazing in the circumstances and is very humbling. A quiet woman with a gentle manner, Than struggles through her daily routines, looking after her children whilst her soldier husband is stationed 40kms from home. It is Cambodia&#8217;s greatest priority to clear the land of mines, mines that have been made in Russia, China, Vietnam and Czechoslovakia. But it is also recognised there are over 100 million live mines scattered around the globe, including mines which have been made by countries such as Germany, France, the United States, and Canada. A very powerful and compelling documentary.

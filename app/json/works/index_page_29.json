and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 8mm and 9.5mm film between the 1940s and 1970s by Charles Edward Hayes (1914–1993). The resulting footage shows us the life of a family living in Heathmont in Melbourne&#8217;s south east with their many pets and farm animals, their family holidays and gatherings, their suburb and their cars as well as scenes from Melbourne at the time.</p>\n<p>Charles Edward Hayes was born on 28th March 1914 and grew up in Port Melbourne. In 1928 he joined Johns &amp; Waygood in City Road, South Melbourne where he worked his way up from office boy to the machine shop becoming a fitter. In 1942 he was nominated to take charge of Johns &amp; Waygood Munitions Annex in Montague making 10lb mortar bombs.</p>\n<p>In the late 1940s, Charles purchased his first 9.5mm movie camera starting a hobby that would bring years of enjoyment. In November 1949 Charles purchased an Austin A40 car which he kept until 1973 – it also makes an appearance or two in the home movies!  On the 11th November 1950, the family purchased a property at Miller Road, Heathmont, comprising 5 acres of land. They decided to build some sheds and try at being poultry farmers. Charles continued travelling to South Melbourne to work until 1956 when they became full time farmers.</p>\n<p>Over the years the family had numerous cows, duck, pigs, sheep, dogs, cats and of course Ticka the cockatoo; all these animals were treated as pets.

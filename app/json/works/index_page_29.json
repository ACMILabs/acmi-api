two-channel installation &#8220;Track and Trials&#8221; sets up a relationship between two opposing screens. One features footage of track riding under the Sydney Harbour Bridge (track riding is a fixed, single gear, break-less style of bicycle riding that was developed in the velodrome but made popular by couriers in New York City in the late 1990s).

Cossington-Smith celebrates not only the construction of the bridge as a triumph of engineering but also Australian modernism.

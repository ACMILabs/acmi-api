Through a philanthropic enterprise he continued to fund development projects for the Nepalese people - projects that the people themselves requested. His legacy will live on through the children of Nepal attending one of the some 30 schools that his &#8220;Himalayan Trust&#8221; built since 1961 - in many cases by his own hands. This DVD contains two documentaries - one made in 1980 is about Sir Edmund at sixty years of age and the other made in 2000 continues the subject matter of his philanthropic work - the DVD release commemorates the 50th Anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary&#8217;s ascent of Mount Everest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Social life and customs", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Charities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community and school", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School buildings", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Mountaineering", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Bridges", "People&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Places&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Places&nbsp;→ Nepal"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2114264, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298847", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114260, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298847", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114257, "name": "Dick Smith Adventure", "creator_id": 20436, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315126", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114255, "name": "Michael Dillon Film Enterprises", "creator_id": 20465, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357797", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2114254, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52935", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34390]}]}

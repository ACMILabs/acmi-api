Widowed playboy millionaire Frederick Loren (Vincent Price) invites 5 guests: a race driver, a columnist, the previous owner, a psychiatrist, and a typist to spend a night with Loren and his fourth wife, Annabelle, in the haunted house. At the strike of midnight the doors will close, the electricity will be out, and 12 hours lie ahead in a tenement in which there have been several mysterious deaths, including those of Loren&#8217;s previous 3 wives. The 4 men and 3 women have nothing in common, other than their need for money, and Loren has posted a reward of $10,000 for anyone who lasts the night.

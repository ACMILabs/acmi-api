Carpenter&#8217;s cult hit is a subversive and satirical take on a New York which was at the time (it was made in 1982), riddled with crime and corruption. The film also takes swipes at right wing paranoia by offering an alarming vision of how the average American would really like to solve escalating crime. Cast includes Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef and Adrienne Barbeau.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisons", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "People&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960379, "name": "AVCO Embassy Pictures", "creator_id": 51583, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960380, "name": "Debra Hill", "creator_id": 51524, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960381, "name": "Larry Franco", "creator_id": 26733, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960382, "name": "John Carpenter", "creator_id": 51535, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49776", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31823]}, {"id": 84261, "acmi_id": "305566", "title": "Escape from Jupiter", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "escape-from-jupiter", "creator_credit": "Film Australia, Terry Jennings, Kate Woods and Fumitaka Tajima", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>When a volcanic eruption destroys the mining colony on Jupiter&#8217;s moon Io, Michael, Kumiko, Gereard, Kingston, Anna and a small group of surviving adults are forced to flee their crumbling world.

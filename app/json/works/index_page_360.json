Tora! Tora! was an epic and expensive production that attempted to present realistically the battle for Pearl Harbour and the ensuing warring between the American and Japanese armies in World War II. In a unique approach, the battle is presented from both sides, rejecting traditional notions of one-sided jingoistic storytelling, typical of many war films from the 50s and 60s. For the Japanese section directors Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku pay close attention to the military manoeuvring and blunders of the campaign as well as the infighting and personal clashes within the high command. For the American section, the army is depicted as unsuspecting of an attack of this scale, hampered by limited technology and a lack of foresight. Exciting battle sequences and detailed inner-sanctum decision making within both sides of the battle make &#8220;Tora! Tora! Tora!&#8221; an interesting war movie that is not simplistic in its politics and is effective in its recreation of a historically significant event. Cast includes Martin Balsam, So Yamamura, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, E.G. Marshall, James Whitemore, Takahiro Tamura, Eijiro Tono, Jason Robards.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Tora! Tora!

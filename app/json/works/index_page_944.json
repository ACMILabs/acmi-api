The second was to delete the part of the constitution that stated that Aboriginal natives should not be counted when tallying the population, more directly affecting representation in parliament and the allocation of Commonwealth grants.<br />\nThese amendments were passed with an overall &#8216;Yes&#8217; vote of over 90%.<br />\n&#8216;This Day Tonight&#8217; focuses on certain pockets of the community who had overall voted &#8216;No&#8217; to this part of the Referendum. This provides a glimpse of some of the prevailing attitudes of the time regarding the Indigenous population. The Referendum is set against a background of increased awareness of Aboriginal issues and amid demands by the Indigenous population for equal rights and recognition. The issues regarding improving living conditions for Aboriginal Australians is also discussed and considered.<br />\nThe second part of the Referendum that was rejected by the Australian people was pertaining to what was called the &#8216;Nexus&#8217;, that would essentially link the number of representatives in each house of the Australian Federal Parliament.

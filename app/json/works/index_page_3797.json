This is the time Ruan&#8217;s ex-husband re-appears and threatens to expose her as an adulteress. Ruan&#8217;s star starts to spiral down. The film blends fact and fiction, documentary and narrative. Rare footage of the real Ruan&#8217;s performances are mixed with Cheung&#8217;s re-creations of Ruan&#8217;s lost films. In a clever twist of casting, the role of Ruan, originally intended for Anita Mui (Kwan&#8217;s star in &#8216;Rouge&#8217;), went to Maggie Cheung. Cheung was the same age as Ruan at the time of her suicide and had had many run-ins with the Hong Kong press. Kwan blends his narrative with documentary style footage of Cheung explaining how she researched the part and interviews with Chinese cinema veterans. The result is an interrogation on cinema itself. The film won several awards, including the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 1992 Berlin Film Festival. Also stars Carina Lau, Waise Lee, Cecilia Yip. In Cantonese with English subtitles. The film is also known as &#8216;The Actress&#8217;, &#8216;The New China Woman&#8217; in various English releases or &#8216;Ruan Ling-yu&#8217; in Mandarin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Germany - Berlin - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media and the arts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women in the motion picture industry", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Mass media and the arts", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hong Kong", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958923, "name": "Paragon Films", "creator_id": 32132, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958924, "name": "Chui Siu Ming", "creator_id": 79332, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958925, "name": "Willie Chan Chi Keung", "creator_id": 79333, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958926, "name": "Stanley Kwan", "creator_id": 29477, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 958922, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47646", "production_places": [{"id": 28, "name": "Hong Kong", "slug": "hong-kong"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [29899]}, {"id": 94118, "acmi_id": "317895", "title": "Centre stage = Center stage (Collector's edition)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "centre-stage-center-stage-collectors-edition-dvd", "creator_credit": "Columbia Pictures Corporation, Laurence Mark and Nicholas Hytner", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this teen ensemble drama, the fortunes of several young ambitious dancers are determined over one year&#8217;s tuition in a prestigious New York dance school, as they compete for just a few contested places.

What&#8217;s in a name you say? everything, especially when you talk about the world&#8217;s greatest rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll band, a name bestowed upon this group of 4 English musicians in the mid &#8216;70&#8217;s. The Who, formed in 1964 and consisting of Keith Moon on drums, John Entwhistle on bass guitar and vocals, Pete Townshend - lead guitar, vocals and major lyricist for the group and Roger Daltry - main vocals. All of the tracks included on the tape come from the album &#8220;Who&#8217;s Better, Who&#8217;s Best&#8221; (made in 1980), although this video does take you on a journey from 1966 through to 1978. Moon died tragically in August of that year. Keith Moon&#8217;s distinct style of drumming is evident in all the film clips except for &#8220;You Better, You Bet&#8221; with Kenny Jones on drums. The song &#8220;Pinball Wizard&#8221; from the Rock Opera &#8220;Tommy&#8221; - considered by many as the definitive rock album, is only one of the many hits contained on the tape. As is &#8220;Won&#8217;t Get Fooled Again&#8221;, filmed at the Shepparton Studios in July 1978 and became the group&#8217;s signature song.

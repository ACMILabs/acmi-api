For really deep diving, it is necessary to take a bottle of oxygen attached to your back in order to look at sunken ships or to do research.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Childrens Films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1102851, "name": "FIB", "creator_id": 24550, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115376, "acmi_id": "58557", "title": "Dandelion = Pusteblume", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dandelion-pusteblume", "creator_credit": "FIB", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 82342, "acmi_id": "38233", "title": "A Load of old rubbish; The World under our feet", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-load-of-old-rubbish-the-world-under-our-feet", "creator_credit": "FIB", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 82341, "acmi_id": "38232", "title": "A roof over your head; Detective work in the woods", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-roof-over-your-head-detective-work-in-the-woods", "creator_credit": "FIB", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38234", "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Estimated date", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [21833]}, {"id": 82342, "acmi_id": "38233", "title": "A Load of old rubbish; The World under our feet", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-load-of-old-rubbish-the-world-under-our-feet", "creator_credit": "FIB", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 2 of Series &#8220;Dandelion = Pusteblume&#8221;.<br />\nTwo episodes of the successful German children&#8217;s series Pusteblume. &#8220;A Load of old rubbish&#8221; - Many old things are thrown away simply because people don&#8217;t know what else to do with them.

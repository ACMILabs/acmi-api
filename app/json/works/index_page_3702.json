The documentary is framed by the 1993 U.S. congressional hearings which resulted in the so-called &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; policy toward gays in the armed services, a policy which was calculated to please no-one and which was predicted to be a failure before it ever began, opening the gates once more on service-wide anti-homosexual entrapment schemes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:11:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ United States - Armed forces", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Discrimination - United State", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962524, "name": "Deepfocus Productions", "creator_id": 35310, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962525, "name": "Arthur E.

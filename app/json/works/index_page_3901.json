Extensive footage from MacGowan&#8217;s past, in particular performances from the 1970s and 80s, presents an artist influenced by the traditions of Irish music and song, but also spurred on by the anti-establishment ethos and damaging excesses of the Punk Rock movement. Sarah Share presents an honest and compelling portrait of an evidently talented musician whose addiction to drugs and alcohol has seriously impeded his ambition and ability to maintain stability, in life and in his art. Songs featured include: Paddy public enemy No 1, If I should fall from grace with God, Infatuation, Gabrielle, Waxie&#8217;s dargle, Streams of whiskey, Dirty old town, The Irish rover, Fiesta, A Rainy night in Soho, Fairytale in New York, White city, Summer in Siam, Song with no name, That woman&#8217;s got me drinking, Haunted and Lonesome highway.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Ireland", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Alcohol use", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - Ireland", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 928843, "name": "Sarah Share", "creator_id": 80722, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361040", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928842, "name": "Emdee 2000 Productions", "creator_id": 36194, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928840, "name": "Irish Film Board", "creator_id": 22054, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299245", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928841, "name": "TG4", "creator_id": 36193, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 928839, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52173", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 27, "name": "Ireland", "slug": "ireland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33792]}, {"id": 95295, "acmi_id": "319361", "title": "Idomeneo", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "idomeneo", "creator_credit": "Christopher Swann, Trevor Nunn, BBC-TV, Glyndebourne and RM Arts", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Heroic drama in three acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, libretto by Abbate Varesco, and performance by the Glyndebourne Chorus (Chorus Director - Jane Glover) and the London Philharmonic Orchestra (Leader - David Nolan) conducted by Bernard Haitink.

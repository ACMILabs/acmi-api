The Islamic movement has declared a Holy War against the West and the Gulf War is at its height. Haifa Samhouri is a middle-aged Palestinian refugee living in Jordan. In this sensitively produced and directed documentary, Haifa talks of her life as a refugee, her love for her homeland, her arranged and loveless marriage, her sons, and her continuing philosophical battle with her religion, Islam, which on the one hand offers salvation and on the other, oppression, especially towards women.

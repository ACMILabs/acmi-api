Tibet is full of  military vehicles, all manned by ethnic Han Chinese. The beginning of this film is a curious one, which confronts the woman doctor with a festive group watching as young men play a shooting game. However, that is the most that the Chinese film is prepared to alight on that topic…</p>\n<p>This newly graduated woman doctor needs to get to the provincial town of Saitang to help the sick and needy, but the next bus is days from now. She decides to approach the liberation army for a ride from on a military supply vehicle. Walking through the rows of army trucks parked beside the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) barracks, she finds a gruff Chinese platoon leader and propositions him (for a ride).</p>\n<p>The platoon leader — who has been having a rough time with his missus back in Beijing — refuses on the pretext of being superstitious of taking women into the highlands. Long story short, her determination ends up getting her a lift anyway. Her two travel companions are the platoon leader and a younger more naive recruit, optimistic and unfamiliar with the harsh wilderness of Tibet.</p>\n<p>Platoon leader sees life as being like an endless trek through the wilderness, fuelled only by a strong will, and the occasional drop of hard liquor. Despite the tough going there are absolutely beautiful shots of the countryside, with its verdant forests and pristine mountainscapes</p>\n<p>On their way they discover an old man who has come down with a bad case of malaria in the forest and decide to take him along. It turns out the man is a hunter, not used to company. He is rude, uncooth and presumptuous toward young Tibetan women: Not the kind of awkward company our female hero wants to be stuck in the back of a truck with. He wants to leave, and when she tries to stop him (because of his sickness) a suspicious article falls from his knapsack. It turns out he is selling valuable medical materials to India and Nepal.</p>\n<p>The truck breaks down and the young man and woman make for the nearest township on foot, braving the risk of death by freezing, and all the beasts of the Tibetan wilderness, such as bears, snowleopards and wolves. They encounter a pack of wolves and must fend them off with fire. Meanwhile, the platoon leader is stuck looking after the cheeky little Tibetan hunter, who sneaks out his stuff and makes a break for it. However he is saved from a close call with wolves by the gun-toting platoon leader.</p>\n<p>The following scene could sum up the entire film: A grumpy tired Chinese soldier carrying an unpleasant old Tibetan musk-smuggler through a terrible and enchantingly untamed wilderness.</p>\n<p>The platoon leader ends up getting along quite well with hunter, who is a wild man, but good at heart. He explains that he just doesn&#8217;t want to be poor forever. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army officer understands this ambition to be self-determining, and this is a central theme of the film.</p>\n<p>At its core, this is a film about the natural will of all people to be invested with freedom and responsibility for their own lives.</p>\n<p>The young couple are forced to turn back, the unarmed boy in disgrace. Meanwhile, the Tibetan woman&#8217;s true grit seems to have restored platoon leader&#8217;s faith in women as capable of feats of great valour, and keen wits to boot. He watches her as she rides off on horseback to find the necessary parts.</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, the truck keeps breaking down, and a massive flood rises up and demolishes the roads. The platoon leader risks his life directing the truck through the flooded waters, with the Tibetan woman getting out to help him and almost being swept away.

The pivotal movement is supposed to tire out the whole body in just a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Each of the artists experience their own labours in reestablishing a connection with this ancient culture, but it seems that it is partly through that hardship that they experience an intimacy with their roots and the creation that blossoms from their own experience, and the tradition they are portraying.</p>\n<p>Instead of following the traditional themes that centred around kings and lords, most songs are of the common people, such as the National Morurning Song, which the Chu people sang for their fallen warriors. Here we see no representation of great deeds, but the sorrow of a people left behind.</p>\n<p>Other songs include those of; drought and natural disasters; a &#8216;Dance of the Sacrificial Rites&#8217; and &#8216;the God of Spring Dong Huang&#8217;(lit. &#8216;Emperor of the East&#8217;,  东皇)</p>\n<p>They basically have to go back to the provinces to rediscover the preserved traditions of the Chinese people. The statement here being that urban centers have lost their sense of Chineseness and people are obligated to go to rural areas to understand their culture.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is blaringly obvious that the performance is reinacted only, with taped music superimposed over the top, and the chimes are not actually struck by the musicians.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>They visit several museums, as well as a temple, viewing the sculptuary of various illustrious mythical figures.</p>\n<p>The film also incorporates a traditional of the dragonboat festival in Hubei, where the long boats reenact the historical event of the boats who strove to recover the body of a drowned patriotic martyr before it is devoured by fish.</p>\n<p>The female protagonist also exhibits many traditional virtues and attitudes, such as filial piety to her father, following in his footsteps of developing a passion for traditional music and dance, as well as compassion and benevolence toward her friends despite being insulted and ridiculed for indulging in backward Chinese stuff.<br />\n(4 stars - James Donald;

Tiangui’s mother tries all means to prevent her son going back, and she wants Tiangui to marry the daughter of a colleague. Noticing the problem, Tiangui’s father blames his wife and asks Tiangui to invite Qiuyue and Cuicui to their home. However, Tiangui’s mother sends a letter to Qiuyue, telling her that only Cuicui is invited. Tiangui would not go without Qiuyue, and Qiuyue eventually compromises. At Tiangui’s home, Qiuyue accidentally finds out that Tiangui’s parents are the couple that she saved years ago. She did not tell the truth to her children but chose to leave without letting anybody know.</p>\n<p>Similar to The Green Mountain of Bamboo (1982), this film also deals with young people’s free love. Traditionally in China, a couple’s marriage would be arranged by their parents. Very often, the couple would have no chance to meet with each other before their wedding day. Arranged marriage is regarded as a “feudal concept” and thus criticized by the CCP. Produced in the early 1980s, this film delivers a message to the audience that CCP members must not be corrupted by feudal ideas.

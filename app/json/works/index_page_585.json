Everything seems to be going according to plan - Julien enters Carala&#8217;s office unobserved, shoots him and arranges the death to look like suicide - but Julien finds himself stuck in an elevator. His car is being stolen by two young joyriders. Malle and his cinematographer, Henri Decae, make extensive use of Paris at night, giving the film the feel of claustrophobia and desperation reminiscent of the classic noir films. The excellent score by Miles Davis adds to the entire effect of this mystery thriller. Awards: Prix Louis-Delluc 1957. I realize now when I look at &#8216;Ascenceur pour l&#8217;echaffaud&#8217;  that I managed to inject - because we had a plot, but the plot was like a skeleton - a number of themes that were, probably unconsciously, close enough to me that they would reappear in my work. But I also wanted to make a good thriller. The irony is, I was really split between my tremendous admiration for Bresson (&#8216;A man escaped&#8217;) and the temptation to make a Hitchcock-like film. In a lot of scenes, especially inside the elevator, I was trying to emulate Bresson.

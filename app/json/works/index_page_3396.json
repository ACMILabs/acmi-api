When Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy) crashes her car, her son Boolie (Dan Ackroyd) insists that his mother&#8217;s driving days are over. He hires a chauffeur for her, Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman) to keep her out of trouble. But feisty Daisy resents the intrusion and she almost drives Hoke crazy with her insistence that she doesn&#8217;t need his help. Luckily, Hoke is a very patient man and the pair become the best of friends after 25 years of driving together. Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress.

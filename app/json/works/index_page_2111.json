He does not have a musical bone in his body however, so the band is unlikely to reach fruition. His plan begins to unravel when he falls for Marion (Shirley Jones), a librarian living in River City. This is the rather simplistic plot that provides a backdrop to the many song and dance routines. Robert Preston reprises his Broadway role as con artist &#8220;Professor&#8221; Harold Hill. Shirley Jones plays the role performed on stage by Barbara Cook. Includes hits such as &#8220;Ya got trouble&#8221;, &#8220;Till there was you&#8221;, &#8220;Marion the librarian&#8221; and &#8220;Seventy six trombones&#8221;.

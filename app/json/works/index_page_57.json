After seeing an Australian movie (&#8216;The man from Snowy River&#8217;) they decide to make their way across the desert to Alexandria.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Pascale Dauman, Francois Margolin ; director, Raymond Depardon ; writer, Raymond Depardon ; photography, Raymond Depardon.<br />\nCast: Francoise Prenant.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1805042, "name": "Pascale Dauman", "creator_id": 83169, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890808, "name": "Francois Margolin", "creator_id": 83170, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146851", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [55618], "external_references": [{"id": 24544, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3053395"}]}, {"id": 93136, "acmi_id": "316513", "title": "El Cid", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "el-cid", "creator_credit": "Anthony Mann, Samuel Bronston and DEAR Film", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1961", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1961-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This dazzling big budget spectacle set in twelfth century Spain brings to life the remarkable tale of Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar - El Cid - a man torn between his sense of honour and his undying loyalty to the crown, and the triumphs and tragedies that await him as he strives to unite his countrymen in a battle against the common enemy.

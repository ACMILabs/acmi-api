British comedian Benny Hill died in 1992 but is still remembered for his rather wicked schoolboy sense of humour, the sometimes tasteless sexual innuendos and smuttiness in his comedy skits and sketches and the wonderful send-ups from TV game shows and news broadcasts, to film parodies, the Royal family and top Hollywood stars. Included in the cast of many, is Australian singer and entertainer, Patsy Ann Noble. Written by Benny Hill with additional material by Robert Gould. NOTE: Due to the archival nature of this material, the sound and picture quality may vary occasionally.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television comedies", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television personalities", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Comedy", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Comedians", "People&nbsp;→ Comedians", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television comedies", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816535, "name": "Kenneth Carter", "creator_id": 18931, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816406, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 816405, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51275", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33150]}, {"id": 88344, "acmi_id": "310903", "title": "Beni Abbes: science in the desert", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "beni-abbes-science-in-the-desert", "creator_credit": "Films Caravelle and Unesco", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1957", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Beni Abbes is a Scientific Research Centre, set up in the Sahara by the French.

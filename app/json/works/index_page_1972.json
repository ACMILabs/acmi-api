Adapted by Crowley from his own play (featuring the original stage cast) and directed by William Friedkin, &#8216;The Boys in the band&#8217; confines its drama to a single, claustrophobic night where a group of friends gather to celebrate the birthday of the wry, razor tongued Harold (Leonard Frey). The party takes a turn for the worse when Michael,(Kenneth Nelson) the party&#8217;s host, has an unexpected visitor, an old heterosexual college friend who is struggling with his own sexuality. The booze soaked party soon turns into a night of psychosexual torture, vicious games and brutal confession.

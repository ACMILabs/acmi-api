Hsi Ching reveals that Van Helsing and his foppish son Leyland have been under the exclusive protection of his family since coming to China, and provides the Professor with proof of his connection to the vampire legend. After the wealthy and adventurous widow Vanessa Buren offers to finance the risky venture, Van Helsing agrees to lead an expedition to Ping Kwei to rid the village of its vampire curse.

Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This Penington family trip, captured on film, focuses mainly on dams visited in Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales including dams of the Kiewa Hydroelectric scheme, the Hume Dam in Albury and the old Cotter Dam in Canberra.</p>\n<p>Also shown is the Tronoh dredge in Harrietville, which was active from 1942 to 1954 and was one of the largest bucket drenches to operate in Victoria collecting 53,814 ounces of gold.</p>\n<p>There is a scene of the Clover Dam under construction and views of the town of Mount Beauty before the addition of the Mount Beauty pondage (circa 1946-1950).</p>\n<p>Of historical interest is the Gundagai Timber Rail Bridge and steam train.

Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This film shows various visitations to South Western Victoria stretching from Cape Otway to Geelong.</p>\n<p>The film begins in Apollo Bay and continues with visits to the Barham River, Cape Otway, Mariner’s lookout and lighthouse, Geelong, Carisbrook Falls and Great Ocean Road with the Twelve Apostles.</p>\n<p>The film includes many scenic views of the sea, beaches, mountains and forests. There are several scenes with groups cooking food outdoors and eating throughout.</p>\n<p>Of interest is the fashion of the time including men and women’s bathers (swimwear) and the wooden body boards and kayaks used.</p>\n<p>Also seen is the T&amp;I mutual Life Society clock tower in Geelong with the famous Father and Son figurine bell ringers coming out to ring the bell.</p>\n<p>The film finishes with a scene showing the result of rough seas with capsized boats and debris.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 Apollo Bay shopping strip with old vintage cars<br />\n00:01:55:00

He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn.

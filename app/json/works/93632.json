The highlight of the film is the depiction of Jamaica&#8217;s vibrant dancehall culture.

Dancehall music is the present day form of Jamaican reggae, voicing the young (and the not so young) population&#8217;s concerns, conflicts, fantasies and frustrations, while offering escapist, humorous observations of oppressive situations.

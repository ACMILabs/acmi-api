sensitive and insightful television biopic portraying the early life of singer/actress Judy Garland, directed by her close friend Jackie Cooper. The film begins with a vaudeville performance by a young toddler named Frances Gumm singing on stage, backed by her piano playing mother and two older sisters in the background. This is the start of a career which will bring stardom and heartache for Baby Frances. Pushed by an ambitious and driven mother, the three sisters, worked hard and travelled frequently performing on the vaudeville stage under the name of the &#8220;Gumm Sisters&#8221; (their name later changing to the &#8220;Garland Sisters&#8221;). But it was Baby Frances who always stole the show and her mother recognising this, began to focus all her energies into achieving success for Frances. We follow Frances&#8217;s journey from those early days through to 1934 when, at the age of 12, she faced her first major audition with Louis B. Mayer who immediately signed her on and changed her name to Judy Garland. Once signed on with MGM, Judy became the property of Louis B. Mayer, or &#8220;Uncle Louie&#8221;, and with her rapid rise to stardom, her young life would be changed forever. For all her success and acclaim in her role of Dorothy in &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; (1939), Judy Garland would suffer identity crisis and body image issues, and ultimately depression, brought on by a very insensitive and unsympathetic male attitude in Mayer who insisted that she take weight-reducing drugs for the part of Dorothy. The impact of this would follow Judy for the rest of her life. Andrea McArdle gives a stunning performance in the role of Judy Garland, along with special mentions to Piper Laurie as Judy&#8217;s mother Ethel Gumm and Martin Balsam as Louis B. Mayer. Cast also includes Don Murray, Michael Parks, Rue McClanahan, Nicholas Pryor, Jack Carter and Donna Pescow.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Rainbow</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ten Four Productions, Peter Dunne and Jackie Cooper</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1978</p>", "description": "<p>A sensitive and insightful television biopic portraying the early life of singer/actress Judy Garland, directed by her close friend Jackie Cooper.

Moody and atmospheric, the pace of the film is as leisurely as the holiday with gentle seaside in the day and partying parents at night. A mix of carefree playfulness (as the girl and her young brother frolic in this idyll) with a darker foreboding and uneasiness just under the surface. Original soundtrack by Neil Finn. Cast includes Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki, Sarah Peirse, Marton Csokas, Alistair Browning, Aaron Murphy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Married people", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ New Zealand literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964898, "name": "New Zealand Film Commission", "creator_id": 3023, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964899, "name": "Rose Road", "creator_id": 37120, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964900, "name": "Communicado", "creator_id": 27176, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964901, "name": "Philippa Campbell", "creator_id": 37121, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964902, "name": "Christine Jeffs", "creator_id": 37122, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964897, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53059", "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [34507]}, {"id": 83187, "acmi_id": "304390", "title": "Rain", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "rain", "creator_credit": "United Artists Corporation, Joseph Schenck and Lewis Milestone", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1932", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1932-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Joan Crawford stars as prostitute Sadie Thompson, in this version of Somerset Maugham&#8217;s story of lust in the sultry Pacific.

Rude is an underground female pirate DJ who, seeking a voice for the troubles that seethe around her, transmits to the projects; General arrives home from jail spell for drug dealing to reconcile with his wife, Jessica (a police officer) and son; General&#8217;s brother longs for Jessica, and works for a white racist drug lord; Jordan, a young boxer, participates in gay bashing, despite his burgeoning desire for men; disconsolate Maxine reflects upon a failed relationship. The fortunes of these characters represent the disempowerment of Canadian minority groups, whose failure to have their cultural origins acknowledged within the broader milieu of the community is echoed in numerous misguided and frustrated acts of aggression. The explicit, rhythmic, political, and erotic rapping of Rude mirrors a potent narrative, moving and frightening in its intensity as it explores the themes of social isolation, homophobia, abortion, drug abuse and the violent expressions of youth.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African American women", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canada - Social life and customs", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African American women", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Drug abuse - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Sociology, Urban", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ African American women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse - Social aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Drug use", "History&nbsp;→ African American women", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2257365, "name": "Clement Virgo", "creator_id": 35334, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5131423", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2257363, "name": "Colin Brunton", "creator_id": 80332, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5144925", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2257361, "name": "Damon D'Oliveira", "creator_id": 80331, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144092", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2257358, "name": "Karen King", "creator_id": 80330, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2257355, "name": "Conquering Lion Production", "creator_id": 35330, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034316", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2257352, "name": "Feature Film Project", "creator_id": 35329, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51114", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [33046]}, {"id": 93540, "acmi_id": "316995", "title": "Scenes from the class struggle in Beverly Hills", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "scenes-from-the-class-struggle-in-beverly-hills", "creator_credit": "Paul Bartel, James C.

The film falls into the Japanese genre of the &#8220;pink film&#8221; (or pinku eiga), a term that has been used since the 1960s to signify a variety of erotic, sado-erotic, and politico-erotic films, straight, gay, or in-between, whose small budgets, often brief running times, place them outside the genre of the mainstream feature. Cast includes Hisanori Kitakaze, Kazufumi Nishimoto and Hiroyuki Oki.

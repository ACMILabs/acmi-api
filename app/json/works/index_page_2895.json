Cast also includes William Peterson as the hero on the cannibal&#8217;s trail.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 878660, "name": "De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 23143, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878661, "name": "Richard Roth", "creator_id": 26147, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878662, "name": "Richard Roth", "creator_id": 26147, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878663, "name": "Michael Mann", "creator_id": 71173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 878659, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48682", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [30819], "external_references": []}, {"id": 83199, "acmi_id": "304402", "title": "Manganinnie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "manganinnie", "creator_credit": "Tasmanian Film Corporation, Gilda Baracchi, John Honey, Robert Hynard, Ross Hamilton and Daphne Crooks", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Manganinnie, fleeing the Aboriginal genocide of 1830 in Tasmania, rescues a tiny lost white child.

Model Tony Ward stars as Monti- a hustler who becomes the lust object and obsession for Bruce Labruce&#8217;s melodramatic journalist, Jurgen Anger. &#8220;Hustler White&#8220;&#8216;s use of real life hustlers and gay porn actors, along with Labruce&#8217;s own gay porn background (he has directed and stared in the underground and very pornographic, Super 8 1/2 and No Skin off my Arse) gives the film a candid documentary feel. Hustler White was co-directed by gay photographer Rick Castro.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Pornography", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Los Angeles (Calif.)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films -

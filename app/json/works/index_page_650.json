Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Blondie, a working class telegraphist who wants to save her boyfriend Johnny (Dermot Mulroney) from the murderous plans of jazz club owner Seldom Seen (Harry Belafonte). Blondie kidnaps the rich Carolyn (Miranda Richardson), hoping that Carolyn&#8217;s politician husband will help save the unlucky Johnny. But it is election eve and in a city dominated by warring prohibition-era gangster tribes, Blondie finds that her needs are never a priority. Though Altman seamlessly weaves elements of noir, screwball comedy and the crime genre, it is his love of jazz music that informs this film.

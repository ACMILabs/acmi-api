From Jung&#8217;s early days selling marijuana on California beaches, through to multi-million dollar cocaine deals with gun-toting Columbians, Demme takes full advantage of the changing music, clothes and hairstyles of the 60&#8217;s, 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s. The fast pace, black humour and violence of the drug world is tempered by the gentler story of Jung&#8217;s failed relationships with his father (Ray Liotta) and his daughter. Cast includes Penelope Cruz, Rachael Griffiths, Paul Reubens, Jordi Molla and Franka Potente.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Greek"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cocaine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924037, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924038, "name": "Ted Demme", "creator_id": 29841, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q654513", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924039, "name": "Joel Stillerman", "creator_id": 80182, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924040, "name": "Denis Leary", "creator_id": 80183, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q310283", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924041, "name": "Ted Demme", "creator_id": 29841, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q654513", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 924036, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50732", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32695], "external_references": [{"id": 2000, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q631515"}]}, {"id": 90643, "acmi_id": "313626", "title": "Blotto", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blotto", "creator_credit": "Hal Roach, Hal Roach Studios and James Parrott", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1930", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1930-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An evening of quiet domestic bliss near the old fireside with Mrs Laurel (Anita Garvin) seated at a bridge table playing solitaire as her husband (Stan Laurel) tries to read a newspaper.

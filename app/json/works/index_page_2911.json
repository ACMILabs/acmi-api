The film then shows the living conditions of the survivors living in horrific poverty next to flourishing mining developments. The people speak of the destruction of their land, their failure to be compensated and of the kind of assistance they require for the sake of their children. The film concludes with the people telling the story of Maralinga and of those who died there - victims of the British atomic bomb tests. Includes cartoons by Bruce Petty.

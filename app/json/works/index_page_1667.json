In order to maintain a balanced non-European perspective, analytical interviews are conducted with Amin Maalouf (writer - &#8216;Leon L&#8217;African&#8217;), Thierry Hentsch (specialist, international relations - &#8216;Imagining the Middle East&#8217;), Nourbese Philip (writer/critic - &#8216;Looking for Livingstone&#8217;, &#8216;Frontiers&#8217;), Sara Suleri (writer/critic - &#8216;The Rhetoric of English India&#8217;) and Ackbar Abbas (critic - commentator on Walter Benjamin and Hong Kong cinema). This excellent and informative program covers social, economical, political, cultural and religious issues including colonialism and imperialism; capitalism and communism; European, African and Asian histories; East/West relations; fundamentalism and secularism; and major historical events such as the partition of India in 1947, the political separation of Hong Kong from China in 1949 and Hong Kong&#8217;s future with the ending of British rule by 1997, the emancipation of slaves, Occidental modernism and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. Contains some b&amp;w archival footage.

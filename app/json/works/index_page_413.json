The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a group walking trip by members of the &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; club to the Grampians (Gariwerd) in Victoria. It features the making of a &#8216;pit oven&#8217; style barbeque and showcases the walking to be had by visitors through the many ravines and paths but also the grandeur of the sweeping views from what can seem like perilous pinnacles and lookouts.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 title cards &#8216;A Walkabout Film&#8217;, &#8216;The Dreaming Place&#8217;, &#8216;A WHC Film&#8217;<br />\n00:00:38:00 views of the Grampians range off in the distance<br />\n00:00:56:00 driving through a small township<br />\n00:02:51:00 creating a &#8216;pit oven&#8217; by setting a fire in a deep hole in the ground<br />\n00:02:59:00 stones are thrown into the flames and then covered with pieces of terracotta tiles on which meat in aluminium foil is placed for cooking<br />\n00:03:38:00 the pit is covered with a piece of metal, hessian bags, stones and dirt<br />\n00:04:15:00 a woman climber is helped to the top of some rocks<br />\n00:06:10:00 cars driving along a dirt road in the bush<br />\n00:06:44:00 an example of the the beautiful rock of the Grampians<br />\n00:07:07:00 sign for &#8216;Forest Commision of Victoria&#8217; &#8216;Camp of the Emu&#8217;s Foot&#8217;<br />\n00:07:15:00 Indigenous art on rock walls<br />\n00:09:48:00 a still river which runs under a wooden walk bridge among tall reeds<br />\n00:10:19:00 a fenced off shallow cavern possibly with Indigenous drawings on the rock<br />\n00:10:35:00 views of Indigenous drawings up close<br />\n00:11:07:00 driving through the bush<br />\n00:11:54:00 grey patchy granite rock of the Grampians<br />\n00:12:29:00 a lone walker stands on top of a high peak<br />\n00:15:25:00 walking through the bush<br />\n00:17:00:00 groups of kangaroos and emus<br />\n00:18:23:00 climbing a steep ravine<br />\n00:20:19:00 sitting on a precipice overlooking the dramatic scenery below<br />\n00:20:43:00 a large body of water, possibly Lake Fyans in the Grampians<br />\n00:23:22:00 walking along narrow pathways through the bush<br />\n00:24:14:00 sign &#8216;Grand Canyon&#8217;<br />\n00:25:43:00 sign &#8216;Echo Cave&#8217; which appears to be painted on the rock itself<br />\n00:26:13:00 another sign &#8216;Pinnacle Street&#8217; painted on a path rock<br />\n00:26:24:00 a rock worn away into the shape of a mushroom<br />\n00:26:49:00 sign &#8216;Silent Street&#8217;<br />\n00:28:12:00 walkers at a pinnacle lookout showing the fencing used for safety in the Grampians</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 24]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, c. 1970s</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The whimsical and arresting Princess Elena suddenly finds herself the centre of attention when she joins the street festivities on Bastille Day, firstly by meeting and falling in love with a handsome young count named Henri (Mel Ferrer) and then being introduced to Henri&#8217;s friend, General Rollan (Jean Marais) who is immediately entranced by Elena&#8217;s sensuous beauty. However, Henri&#8217;s priorities, although quite smitten with Elena, are political and lie in his quest to persuade General Rollan to seize power. For this he decides to enlist Elena and her charms.

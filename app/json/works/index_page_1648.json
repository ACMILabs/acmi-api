This is a film by the students of Form 3A at Ushaw Moor Secondary School, County Durham, whereby the work included film teaching, scripting, location shooting, acting, music teaching, sound recording and film and sound editing. Scripted after their own stories, this amusing film is about a lower middle-class adolescent boy given the chore of buying groceries for his mother but spends the time mucking about with his friends and terrorising the neighbours. During this little outing, he spots a half crown coin lying in the gutter, which he splurges with his friends on sweets - but where has the grocery money gone?</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Audio-visual education", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sound - Recording and reproducing", "Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Student films - Great Britain", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Films by children", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art in education", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Arts", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Arts, European", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Audio-visual education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education, Secondary", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Music teachers, Training of", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music teachers, Training of", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Sound - Recording and reproducing", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2645039, "name": "Derek Logan", "creator_id": 74777, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126055", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2645038, "name": "Jim Moody", "creator_id": 74776, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271359", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2645037, "name": "Ushaw Moor Secondary Modern School", "creator_id": 15488, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23963", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [7823]}, {"id": 68327, "acmi_id": "321181", "title": "Harmony in music", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "harmony-in-music", "creator_credit": "Coronet Instructional Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1952", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1952-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Elementary students in a school ensemble and in a chorus learn how harmony enriches music.

Childhood games are revealed to be far from innocent: Buck wants to return to the playfulness of their sexual exploration when they were adolescent boys; but Chuck is fearful of the unresolved tensions and consequences of this early experimentation. Both Buck&#8217;s relentless refusal to be an adult, and Chuck&#8217;s equally fervent denial of his childhood sexuality lead to potentially dangerous consequences for both themselves and those around them. &#8220;Chuck and Buck&#8221; suggests it is only through the translating of his obsessions and fears into theatre, into drama and art, that Buck can find a way to release himself from the legacy of his childhood. For all its menace, &#8220;Chuck and Buck&#8221; allows the possibility not only for tolerance but an understanding to emerge between the old friends; an understanding not predicated on either false nostalgia or on denying the eroticism of friendship. The film also features some light-hearted affectionate satire about actors, auditions and the theatre world and features an excellent support performance by Lupe Ontiveros. Paul Weitz plays Chuck&#8217;s theatrical alter-ego. The film was shot on digital video format.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Digital cinematography", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Childhood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys - Sexual behavior", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Games", "Literature&nbsp;→ Creative writing", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Acting - Auditions"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/chuck-and-buck", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962466, "name": "Flan de Coco Film", "creator_id": 35257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962467, "name": "Matthew Greenfield", "creator_id": 35258, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962468, "name": "Miguel Arteta", "creator_id": 35259, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51071", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33005], "external_references": [{"id": 2595, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5115320"}, {"id": 3813, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "44490"}]}, {"id": 88904, "acmi_id": "311526", "title": "Chronicle of a love = Loving lie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "chronicle-of-a-love-loving-lie", "creator_credit": "Villani Films and Michelangelo Antonioni", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1950", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Antonioni&#8217;s highly acclaimed first film relates the tale of an adulterous wife and her impoverished lover who plan to murder her rich husband.

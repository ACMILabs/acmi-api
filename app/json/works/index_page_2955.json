This exceptionally stylish film traces Henry&#8217;s rise from waiter to Mafia hit-man. Edited at an adrenalin-pumping pace, &#8220;Goodfellas&#8221; examines the Mafia from the inside, exposing the violence but also detailing the family kinships and rituals essential to the organisation&#8217;s existence. As we move along in time from the rock and roll fifties to the acid-drenched seventies, the carefully controlled world of organised crime begins to fall apart with the introduction of hard drugs. &#8220;Goodfellas&#8221; showcases Scorsese&#8217;s direction at its most dazzling, the camera dancing and weaving around the sumptous sets and the fiery performers. And what performers! Liotta, Robert de Niro and Paul Sorvino are all excellent.

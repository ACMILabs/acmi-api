Various symbols and forms of communication are used to depict the vicissitudes of the attitudes to love. Flowers are crushed and then thrown overboard, a comb is broken in anguish, diary entries allow for a subjective expression of attraction and the fear of being ‘held back’ by conventional strictures of love, cleaners remark that “young people should work hard for the revolution”. The layering of fiction with the use of narrative ‘secrets’ combined with the self reflexive references to films within films creates dialogue, symbols and characters with layered meanings.</p>\n<p>The Third Mate (Yang Ying) represents the ‘new’ Chinese woman, one that takes control of the ship, navigating by knowledge and sight, by intuition expressed in the ‘feel’ of the breeze. A further flashback to a time 14 years prior shows Yang as a younger woman, learning the knowledge required to ‘direct ships through the divine gorges’. The flashback includes her reminiscence of a dramatic whirlpool that carried off her family, leaving her the only one to survive. Yang was adopted by a family who lived at a signal station on the edge of a cliff. There, her father and her brother were in charge of dropping down a large arrow signalling the danger of the sharp cliffs to passing ships. Sequences with the family are full of joy and tragedy and as characters are lost, deep sorrow is depicted by tears that seem to flow down the camera/screen. The narrative details the transition from traditional and contemporary approaches to the rituals of love. One moment of resistance intercedes in an exchange and betrothal of Yang as her brother Ming considers a request from a potential boyfriend. The film allows for a poetic expression of the connection between marine life and love in the song that Yang performs a folk song which includes the lyrics “the red leaves remind her of him setting fire to her heart” and “the river is her lover”.</p>\n<p>&#8216;When The Leaves Turn Red&#8217; is also a travelogue documenting changes in China’s environmental and industrial landcapes. As the steamer moves along the river, the film isolates details of bridges, cliffs and the seasonal change depicted by the emergence of the red foliage on the mountains.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - Asia, Southeastern", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boats and boating", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 843580, "name": "Yu Benzheng", "creator_id": 82246, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 843579, "name": "Tang Huada", "creator_id": 84237, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 843578, "name": "Shanghai Film Studio", "creator_id": 32710, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 843590, "name": "Wang Qi", "creator_id": 84243, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843589, "name": "Hong Xia", "creator_id": 84242, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843588, "name": "Ma Guanying", "creator_id": 82416, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843587, "name": "Gao Ying", "creator_id": 84241, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843586, "name": "He Lin", "creator_id": 84240, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843585, "name": "Ding Jiayuan", "creator_id": 82856, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843584, "name": "Wu Haiyan", "creator_id": 82641, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843583, "name": "Xiang Yi", "creator_id": 84239, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843582, "name": "Han Shanyi", "creator_id": 84238, "role": "sound design/post-production", "role_id": 533, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 843581, "name": "Shen Xilin", "creator_id": 82398, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "161843", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [56955]}, {"id": 80258, "acmi_id": "36051", "title": "When the Fire Comes", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "when-the-fire-comes", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1987", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>When the Fire Comes</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1987</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Forest fires"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

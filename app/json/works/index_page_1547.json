Trudy&#8217;s secretive nature about her line of work leads Brendan to believe she is some kind of criminal, perhaps even a violent one. Brendan&#8217;s attempts to introduce Trudy to his snobbish family are disastrous and the pair struggle to keep their romance aflame. Characters enact scenes from Brendan&#8217;s favourite films, replete with subtitles. Part of the appeal of this film is the litany of film references and clips lifted from old movie classics.

Walsh and starring Flora Montgomery and Peter McDonald.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Dublin (Ireland", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Women prisoners", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Places&nbsp;→ Dublin (Ireland", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998040, "name": "Kieron Walsh", "creator_id": 35423, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q59456260", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998039, "name": "Lynda Myles", "creator_id": 25961, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998038, "name": "BBC Film Unit", "creator_id": 7251, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998037, "name": "Collins Avenue", "creator_id": 35422, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998036, "name": "Dendy Films", "creator_id": 27284, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998035, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51207", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33093], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93588, "acmi_id": "317098", "title": "The Shootist [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-shootist-dvd", "creator_credit": "Don Siegel, William Self, M Frankovich and De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1976", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in 1901, John Wayne plays John Bernard Books - an ornery, aging gunfighter who returns to his old hometown, where his presence is unwanted and his way of life deemed obsolete.

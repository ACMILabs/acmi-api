Made on an epic scale, it does not flinch from portraying the savagery of the time, from which, almost inexplicably, the serenity of Rublev&#8217;s art arose. The great set-pieces - the sack of Vladimir, the casting of the bell, the pagan ceremonies of St. John&#8217;s Night and the Russian crucifixion are tours-de-force of visceral film making. This is the most complete version of the film available and reported to be the director&#8217;s cut.

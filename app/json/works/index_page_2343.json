Shot in black and white and &#8220;cinemascope&#8221; this lush film is filled with all you would expect from a Western: guns, fancy horse riding, showdowns and a bit of romance. The tough town femme-fatale Jessica Drummond (Barbara Stanwyck) has a posse of forty hired guns that make her the de facto leader of the County. She falls in love with a Marshall (Barry Sullivan) who arrives to restore law and order with tensions building up to a showdown.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Horse riding", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Horses", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Firearms", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Tornadoes", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Weddings", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Cowboys", "People&nbsp;→ Cowboys", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2000440, "name": "Samuel Fuller", "creator_id": 77765, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262479", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000439, "name": "Samuel Fuller", "creator_id": 77765, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262479", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000438, "name": "Globe Enterprises", "creator_id": 37209, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000437, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2000436, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53130", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [34574]}, {"id": 95067, "acmi_id": "319112", "title": "Cube", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "cube-dvd", "creator_credit": "Vincenzo Natali, Betty Orr, Mehra Meh, Cube Libre, Feature Film Project and Trimark Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44476, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q467840"}], "brief_description": "<p>First time director Vincenzo Natali&#8217;s low budget thriller is a tribute to the ensemble cast performances as well as his direction.

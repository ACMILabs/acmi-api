Led by Sinatra, the Rat Pack were infamous for their carousing, womanising, drinking, entertaining and swinging image and in this film they do not stray far from their real life personas. &#8220;Ocean&#8217;s eleven&#8221; is not a film that treats the heist genre seriously in that it lacks any real tension of great films of that type. Rather, the film&#8217;s joys are derived from its 1960s aesthetic, the machinations of the sartorial Rat Pack at play, and the musical numbers courtesy of Davis and Martin. Also stars: Angie Dickinson , Cesar Romero, Shirley MacLaine, Joey Bishop and Red Skelton.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "German", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/oceans-eleven-1960", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997238, "name": "Lewis Milestone", "creator_id": 71794, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q285928", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997236, "name": "Dorchester", "creator_id": 34895, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997237, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997235, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50733", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [32696]}, {"id": 93192, "acmi_id": "316596", "title": "Blow", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blow-dvd", "creator_credit": "Ted Demme, Denis Leary, Joel Stillerman and New Line Cinema", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47307, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q631515"}], "brief_description": "<p>Produced and directed by the late Ted Demme, Blow hurtles through three heady decades in the life of notorious drug dealer George Jung (Johnny Depp).

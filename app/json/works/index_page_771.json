Compounded by Henry&#8217;s many inexplicable absences, his wife Helen, feeling neglected and bored with their marriage, turns to sleazy car salesman Simon for excitement. Harry&#8217;s latest assignment is on the trail of several missing nuclear warheads that have been stolen by some maniacal Arab terrorists. James Cameron directs here with typical flair for exciting set pieces and a predilection for crude villain/hero and gender stereotypes. Arnold Schwarzenegger embraces the role as the omnipotent and duplicitous Harry who can tackle any form of violence and danger but whose response to a marriage crisis is to kidnap his wife, subject her to a terrifying interrogation, then send her on a bogus assignment as a prostitute.

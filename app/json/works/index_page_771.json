Originally screened on Channel 9, most production took place in the Melbourne suburb of Canterbury due to its proximity to the studios. The series prided itself on historical accuracy and was from the perspective of an &#8220;average&#8221; Australian family and their experience on the home front during World War II - Dave and Grace Sullivan, their only daughter Kitty, and sons Tom, Jo, and Terry. Also populating the family&#8217;s milieu are nosy neighbour Mrs Jessup, Dave&#8217;s pub companion and war buddy, Norm, and local publican Maggie Hayward. This DVD contains the first four episodes of the series and depicts the countdown to war: beginning September 1939, the third last day of peace.

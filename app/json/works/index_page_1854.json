Daily, Babe tests himself running the streets of New York, but the ultimate test comes when his dubious brother (Roy Scheider) springboards the marathon man into an international conspiracy of diamonds, Nazis and double-crossings. Despite a stand-out performance by Laurence Olivier and some of the most well-known torture sequences in cinema history, &#8216;Marathon Man&#8217; is perhaps little more than a run-of-the-mill thriller.

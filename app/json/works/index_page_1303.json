Planet Earth has only one life form: all life on Earth shares some of the same genetic code and has developed from the same evolutionary tree. It is recognised that humans and apes share 98% of the same DNA. But could life have evolved differently out there in the cosmos? Astrophysicists, geologists, biochemists, astronomers, and biopalaeontologists discuss their theories and discoveries, both on Earth and in space, to help shed some light on this mystery of life. Uses microphotography, 3D animation and some excellent cinematography to provide a visual spectacle to what has always been a fascinating subject for discussion. Narrated by Lynne Adams.

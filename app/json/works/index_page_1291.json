This work is a collection of television fragments videotaped directly from the TV screen in an array of countries in which Asher has travelled. On the one hand LDTV reflects the nomadic character of Asher&#8217;s work, but at the same time it reproduces the effect of a satellite fixed in space, giving unlimited access to a homogenised world. With vitality and humor, LDTV traces the speed at which Western culture is transmitted globally.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:20:23:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1038967, "name": "Dan Asher", "creator_id": 6279, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 13347, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_010.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "from L.A Woman", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 400, "height": 298, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "60", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [47390]}, {"id": 107896, "acmi_id": "59", "title": "[Japan tapes]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "japan-tapes", "creator_credit": "Dan Asher", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1997", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B1000068_JapanTapes_002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Digital art", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A collection of brief videotaped encounters on one of Asher&#8217;s travels to Japan.

In English and Hindi with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Controversial Indian filmmaker Anand Patwardhan (War and peace = Jang aur aman) is confronting and courageous in tackling head on in this two-part documentary, the religious and political violence which currently exists in India today between the Hindi majority and the Islamic minority. More importantly however, is the understanding and historical background of India&#8217;s culture and belief system which is provided through personal stories and interviews from a broad spectrum of societal, political and religious Hindus and Muslims. Anand examines the crisis of male identity among the Hindus and their obsession with male strength, power and control over their women and over Muslims. He also highlights the rise of civil rights and women&#8217;s resistance movements and the call for equality and peace between the two religions. Anand walks the fine line in his attempt to maintain balance but the overriding issue is that of women, whether Hindu or Muslim, and their appalling treatment by extremists from both sides. Part 1. Trial by fire: Begins with a Hindu perspective of the Bombay riots in 1993 where Hindus set fire to Muslim shops and then follows with a historical look into how and why matriarchal India turned into the patriarchal India of today with its roots of continuing religious violence. Part 2. Hero pharmacy: Explores manhood, sexuality and physicality and their relationship to conflict and violence, juxtaposed with the awareness by women of their own place in society and a calling for unity, equality and humanity in religion. Also shows the 1993 Bombay riots from a Muslim perspective. Includes some b&amp;w footage.

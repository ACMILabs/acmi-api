This elaborate coda, in which life is seen as a set of pre-ordained events and consequences, culminates in a devastating denouement in which all previous characters from the trilogy are ironically united in tragedy in a truly haunting end to the director&#8217;s oeuvre. Co-starring Jean-Pierre Lorit and Frederique Feder. In French with English subtitles. Cinematography, Piotr Sobockinski. Editing, Jacques Witta. Music, Zbigniew Preisner. Screenplay, Krzysztof Piesiewicz and Krzysztof Kieslowski.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Judges", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/three-colors-red", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961789, "name": "MK2 Productions", "creator_id": 27077, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961790, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961791, "name": "CAB Productions SA", "creator_id": 27079, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961792, "name": "TOR Film Studio", "creator_id": 27080, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961793, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961794, "name": "Marin Karmitz", "creator_id": 22337, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961795, "name": "Krzysztof Kieslowski", "creator_id": 25379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961788, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50693", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32659], "external_references": [{"id": 1091, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q952142"}, {"id": 6424, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "110"}]}, {"id": 92789, "acmi_id": "316118", "title": "Three colours blue = Trois couleurs bleu [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "three-colours-blue-trois-couleurs-bleu-dvd", "creator_credit": "MK2 Productions, CED, France 3 Cinema, CAB, TOR Film Studio, Canal+, Marin Karmitz and Krzysztof Kieslowski", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1993", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Three colours blue is the first installment in Krzysztof Kieslowski&#8217;s trilogy based on the three ideals of the French revolution - liberty, equality and fraternity.

A 26-year old girl lost hope for life as one of her legs was amputated because of blood disease. Death and the Maiden tells the story of how an old man and a girl encouraged each other to fight against death and live life with hope. The old man, a writer, condemns the doctor for saving his life as this would only make him suffer in his final days of life. However, the old man promised to live on in order to help a young lady he encountered in the hospital to survive the hardship in her life and marry her boyfriend. The liver cancer took the old man&#8217;s life eventually and the girl lost the other leg. However, after the old man&#8217;s death, the girl is determined to live life with hope.

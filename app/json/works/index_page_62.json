By utilising the psychic abilities of &#8220;precogs&#8221;&#8212;three individuals who have been rendered schizophrenic by being born to drug-addicted mothers&#8212;he can identify killers before they commit their crimes. The Precrime Unit, led by the zealous John Anderton (Tom Cruise), whose son was abducted years ago, has resulted in the apparent end of homicide in Washington DC. But on the eve of Precrime going national, John Anderton finds himself in an accidental encounter with one of the precogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), which leads to his name being revealed as a future murderer. With only one day and night in which to prove his &#8220;innocence&#8221;, Anderton kidnaps Agatha and searches for the true secrets underlying the miracle of Precrime judgement. Based on a short fiction by Philip K. Dick, &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; is a darkly dystopic vision of the future. Echoing Ridley Scott&#8217;s &#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; in presenting a world divided into enclaves of privilege and vast slums of poverty and crime, the film works best in realistically conveying the architecture, technology and domiciles of a possible future.

Trent (Vaughn) is Mike&#8217;s most confident and smooth talking friend, a sartorial charmer who has a way with the ladies and is constantly on the make. Mike struggles with the convoluted courtship rules, whilst battling his extensive self-doubts and self-consciousness. &#8220;Swingers&#8221; works as a sharp satire of the LA scene where bit actors scrape by on the glory of call-backs for pilots and former glories are regurgitated in the hope of getting lucky in love. With a warm, energetic quality, and a talky, funny script, the film regales the audience with memorable characters and hilarious scenarios.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adulthood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Dating (Social customs)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Adulthood", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Places&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/swingers", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998641, "name": "Doug Liman", "creator_id": 35887, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q349339", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998640, "name": "Victor Simpkins", "creator_id": 35886, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q91102833", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998639, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998638, "name": "Independent Pictures", "creator_id": 71714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998637, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51822", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [33472], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93961, "acmi_id": "317721", "title": "You can count on me", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "you-can-count-on-me-dvd", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Lonergan, John N.

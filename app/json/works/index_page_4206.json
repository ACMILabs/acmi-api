Her speed and passion for cycling impresses and threatens her colleagues as she weaves her way through traffic from one job to another. On one of her trips, a broken chain leads her to a bike store tucked away in a quiet street. There she meets the gruff Italian owner Lorenzo (Dino Tavarone), who was a cycling champion in his youth. Initially dismissive and suspicious of Laurie and her obsession with cycling, he slowly begins to trust her, recounting stories from his past on subsequent visits. Although Laurie and Lorenzo appear to move in different worlds, separated by age and gender, they gradually discover that essentially they have much in common, including their taste in women. Cast also includes Pascal Auclair, Yves Pelletier, Andre Brassard, Jici Lauzon and Louise Forestier. Photographed by James Gray; edited by Richard Comeau; music by Sylvain-Charles Grand and Dominique Grand.

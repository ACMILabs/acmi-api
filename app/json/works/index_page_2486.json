Their happy life together begins to unravel after Leila finds herself unable to conceive. While the couple are unconcerned about this development, Reza&#8217;s mother is determined that her son have children, and insists that he must take a second wife to produce a heir and continue the family line. When Reza refuses to give in to her demands she turns to Leila, beating down her resistance to the idea with a mix of pleading, haranguing, and lies, until the couple limply gives in.

Stars John Lone, Peter O&#8217;Toole and Joan Chen. Winner of nine Academy Awards (including Best Picture). The music is by David Byrne and Ryuichi Sakamoto.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ History", "People&nbsp;→ P'u-i, 1906-1967"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 949942, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 949943, "name": "Jeremy Thomas", "creator_id": 62126, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 949944, "name": "Bernardo Bertolucci", "creator_id": 23664, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37276", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [20905], "external_references": [{"id": 272, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q212775"}]}, {"id": 79047, "acmi_id": "017761", "title": "The Last days work", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-days-work", "creator_credit": "Brian McKenzie", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>It is not just the threatening capacity of global nuclear war nor the disfiguration of natural ecological forces but rather it is the work people do that indicates the end of their use on this planet.

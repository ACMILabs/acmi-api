Cast includes Geoffrey Morrell as Sidney Cotton and Jim Cullington as Field Marshall Kesselring.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This is a remarkable story about a remarkable Australian, Sidney Cotton, who was able to fool the German High Command to enable him to fly safely in and out of Germany as that country prepared for war. He took photographs that revolutionised aerial military photography forever. In fact his work in aerial espionage and photographic intelligence was to be instrumental in the foundation of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit of the Royal Air Force. He worked on behalf of the French Deuxieme Bureau and the British MI6 and was a friend of Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond. Cotton was also a confidante of top ranking Nazis like Hermann Goering and Albert Kesselring and acted as a go-between in negotiations between Goering and the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. Born near Proserpine, Queensland, the son of a prominant Queensland grazier, Sidney Cotton, known for his continual defiance and love of adventure, was to be forever remembered as the one who flew the last civilian plane out of Berlin before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He died in England in 1969 at the age of 74. Filmed as a docudrama with historical re-enactments and interviews with family, friends and former Air Force personnel. Also includes archival war footage, stills and home movies. Presented and narrated by Jeff Watson and filmed on location in Britain, Germany and Australia. Cast includes Geoffrey Morrell as Sidney Cotton and Jim Cullington as Field Marshall Kesselring.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Aerial photography", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Aerial reconnaissance", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Germany", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Great Britain", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Aerial photography", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Espionage", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Docudrama", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Historical re-enactments", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Cotton, Sidney, 1894-", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 879140, "name": "Jeff Watson Productions", "creator_id": 25708, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 879141, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 879142, "name": "Frank Haines", "creator_id": 17463, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 879143, "name": "Jeff Watson", "creator_id": 77449, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 879139, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48988", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31100], "external_references": []}, {"id": 97774, "acmi_id": "506934", "title": "The Last meow: 'Valse Triste', Jean Sibelius", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-meow-valse-triste-jean-sibelius", "creator_credit": "Italtoons and Bruno Bozzetto", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Excerpt from &#8220;Allegro Non Troppo&#8221; by Bruno Bozzetto with music by Jean Sibelius.

Daniel Lefebvre (Philippe Torreton) is a kindergarten teacher who is passionately committed to his job but is also frequently demoralised by the social milieu in which he operates - an economically depressed mining town in France where the parents are mostly jobless, suffering from acute poverty as well as, in many cases, alcoholism, abuse and destitution.

It is the story of the Heidelberg School of artists, written by Bill Garner and based on an original idea by Humphrey McQueen. Episode three focuses on Roberts&#8217; painting &#8220;Shearing the rams&#8221; and his attempts to sell it first to the National Gallery (Victoria) who reject the offer and then to whoever in &#8220;society&#8221; Melbourne might be interested.

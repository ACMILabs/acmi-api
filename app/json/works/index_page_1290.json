Writes Baldino: According to William James, the &#8216;present&#8217; is about 3 to 12 seconds long; everything else is constructed memory. Each segment of In the Present is within this time frame. What you see or don&#8217;t see depends on what you remember. Your memory becomes part of the picture and distorts the idea of &#8216;present&#8217; time.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1038973, "name": "Phyllis Baldino", "creator_id": 6282, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1038974, "name": "Al Arthur", "creator_id": 73056, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 13352, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre002.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "still #1 from In the Present", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13353, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalinthepre003.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "still #2 from In the Present", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "65", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [47395]}, {"id": 107901, "acmi_id": "64", "title": "Voyage to the center of the phone lines", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "voyage-to-the-center-of-the-phone-lines", "creator_credit": "Michel Auder", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1993", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/micaudvoytothecen002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Digital art", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this chilling work, Auder taps into phone lines and uncovers dark narratives of ordinary lives.

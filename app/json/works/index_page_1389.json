Our galaxy and the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy were rendered using specially-written software which models the 3D distribution of tens of millions of individual stars and clouds of light-blocking dust, using telescopic images as a template. These and the other galaxies were portrayed in their correct relative positions, size, morphological type and dominant colour. By the end of the sequence we are looking back, across chains and walls of galaxies, from the edge of the known universe.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Great Britain", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation&nbsp;→ 3-D computer animation", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2675416, "name": "Planetary Visions", "creator_id": 8827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1868", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [48213]}, {"id": 108719, "acmi_id": "B1004271", "title": "ACMI Presentations", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "acmi-presentations", "creator_credit": "Media Design Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>John Smithies, CEO of ACMI delivered a series of presentations relating to the opening of ACMI at Federation Square.

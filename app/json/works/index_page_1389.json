Archival photographs and the personal recollections of surviving escapees highlight the complexity of the operation, while historians reveal the Nazi&#8217;s harsh response to the escape. The second escape documented is that by 25 Nazi officers from an Arizona prisoner-of-war camp: the largest escape from a US camp. It is a little known fact that most of the 500,000 German prisoners of World War II were actually held in POW camps within the US. Surviving German POWs and their American guards are interviewed and rare photographs, films and dramatic re-creations employed to explore this perfectly executed operation, from the Germans&#8217; request for digging tools, to the capture of the last escapee. Also featured is a comprehensive overview of the resistance movements throughout occupied Europe A second tape entitled &#8220;More great escapes of World War 2&#8221; is also available.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Escapes", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Resistance movements, War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Escapes", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Escapes", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 809515, "name": "Greystone Communications", "creator_id": 33134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809516, "name": "A&E Television Networks", "creator_id": 28023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809517, "name": "Robert Kirk", "creator_id": 79638, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 809514, "name": "Viburnum Gardens", "creator_id": 76390, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49245", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [31341], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90449, "acmi_id": "313415", "title": "The Great escape [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-great-escape-dvd", "creator_credit": "United Artists Corporation, Mirisch Corporation and John Sturges", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1963", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A classic Hollywood war film, combining a gift for storytelling with bravura and blockbuster entertainment.

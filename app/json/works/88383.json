After 7 years and 20,000 pages of testimony, McLibel tells the story of what became the longest running trial in England&#8217;s history. Without access to legal aid Morris and Steel represented themselves in a case that struck at the heart of free speech and raised many vexing issues. They included the right of a multinational to suppress criticism simply by suing for libel; corporate accountability in advertising; and the fairness of a legal system that allows such cases of libel by multinationals whilst denying legal representation to defendants. The documentary uses interviews with witnesses and reconstructions of key moments in court (directed by Ken Loach) to examine the main issues in the trial (nutrition, advertising, employment, cruelty to animals, environment). McLibel is about multinational corporations and the power they wield over our every lives. Reference: McLibel: two worlds collide.

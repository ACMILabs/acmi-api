Refreshingly, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; has subscribed to the new paradigm of teen horror, whereby the protagonist teen character is given personality and a surname. With a supporting cast that is less disposable than the teenager characters of slasher films of the past, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; is more suspenseful and more frightening, and a horror film that can stand on its own merit. Cast includes: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, Freddy Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Horror", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-2-i-still-know-what-you-did-last-summer", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2475195, "name": "Danny Cannon", "creator_id": 80645, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1164532", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475194, "name": "Neal H.

Short animated satire on the desire for personal wealth. The moral of the film is that the idea of suddenly gaining personal wealth is very attractive, including the delusion that it will bestow power and influence. However, desires are only dreams: it is more realistic to build one&#8217;s happiness on one&#8217;s true situation.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Great Britain", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Materialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 762514, "name": "New Fields", "creator_id": 19886, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 762515, "name": "Derek Phillips Animation", "creator_id": 19887, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "32432", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [16158], "external_references": []}, {"id": 75515, "acmi_id": "012918", "title": "When I'm calling you (NP)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "when-im-calling-you-np", "creator_credit": "Video Arts and Peter Robinson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A lesson on the use of the telephone in business.

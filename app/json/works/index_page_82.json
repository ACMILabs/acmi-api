Much of this film was made by Hurley when he accompanied Sir Douglas Mawson and an Australian party to the Antarctic in 1912 and on later expeditions. The program traces the history of the Australian expeditions between 1911 and 1914 and the establishment of Mawson Station. A rare film which reveals the true hardship and courage of these early pioneers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Explorers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Explorers - Antarctica", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mawson station (Australian Antarctic Territory)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mawson, Douglas, Sir, 1882-1958", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History - 1901-1914", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ Explorers", "History&nbsp;→ Explorers - Antarctica", "History&nbsp;→ Mawson, Douglas, Sir, 1882-1958", "People&nbsp;→ Mawson, Douglas, Sir, 1882-1958", "Places&nbsp;→ Mawson station (Australian Antarctic Territory)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2043264, "name": "Phillip Garth Law", "creator_id": 74195, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043263, "name": "Frank Hurley", "creator_id": 13379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043262, "name": "Maslyn Williams", "creator_id": 12186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043261, "name": "Frank Bagnall", "creator_id": 11968, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043260, "name": "Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "creator_id": 11967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2043267, "name": "Frank Hurley", "creator_id": 13379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "narrator", "role_id": 499, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043266, "name": "John West", "creator_id": 74161, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "narrator", "role_id": 499, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043265, "name": "Lee Robinson", "creator_id": 12521, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creative producer", "role_id": 964, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043259, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35443", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1962", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1962"}], "labels": [19117], "external_references": []}, {"id": 79574, "acmi_id": "300529", "title": "Sunny and the dark horse", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sunny-and-the-dark-horse-a", "creator_credit": "David MacDougall, Judith MacDougall and AIAS Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1986", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This is a companion to the documentaries &#8216;Stockman&#8217;s Strategy&#8217; and &#8216;Collum Calling Canberra&#8217;.

The film falls into the Japanese genre of the &#8220;pink film&#8221; (or pinku eiga), a term that has been used since the 1960s to signify a variety of erotic, sado-erotic, and politico-erotic films, straight, gay, or in-between, whose small budgets, often brief running times, place them outside the genre of the mainstream feature. Cast includes Hisanori Kitakaze, Kazufumi Nishimoto and Hiroyuki Oki.

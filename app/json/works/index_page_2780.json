An exquisite recreation of the Hong Kong of the early sixties is achieved through Kar-Wai concentrating on the colors and textures of cloth and surfaces; on the sound of rain and the rustle of bodies passing each other in narrow hallways. The film can be compared to a lyrical chamber piece where the direction of Kar-Wai, the luscious cinematography of Christopher Doyle, the musical score by Michael Galasso, the intimate performances of Cheung and Leung, and the stunning production design of William Chang Suk-Ping come together to form an astonishing powerful cinematic quintet. A love story that can justifiably be called timeless and mise-en-scene so romantic that it carries enormous emotion gravitas, this film has won awards throughout the globe (including Best Actor for Leung at Cannes as well as an outstanding technical achievement award for the combined talents of the filmmakers).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Cantonese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Romance"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/in-the-mood-for-love", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}, {"url": "http://www.wkw-inthemoodforlove.com/", "title": "kw-inthemoodforlove.com", "source": "vernon"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 275047, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275048, "name": "Block 2 Pictures", "creator_id": 72938, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275049, "name": "Jet Tone Production", "creator_id": 72939, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275051, "name": "Wong Kar-wai", "creator_id": 72940, "role": "screenplay", "role_id": 3, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275052, "name": "Wong Kar-wai", "creator_id": 72940, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275053, "name": "Wong Kar-wai", "creator_id": 72940, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 275054, "name": "William Chang", "creator_id": 72941, "role": "costume design", "role_id": 13, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 275050, "name": "Joe Cheung", "creator_id": 2944, "role": "actor", "role_id": 914, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 275055, "name": "William Chang", "creator_id": 72941, "role": "art direction", "role_id": 920, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "843", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Hong Kong", "slug": "hong-kong"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000-05-22", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [46950]}, {"id": 109228, "acmi_id": "B1006084", "title": "In the mirror of Maya Deren", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-the-mirror-of-maya-deren", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>In the mirror of Maya Deren</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2705", "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [48721]}]}

This two part series, narrated by Liam Neeson, explores the life of this important revolutionary thinker. In episode one, &#8220;Driven To Defiance&#8221;, we are taken through Luther&#8217;s early childhood and years as a student where his deepening spiritual faith leads him to a vocation as a monk. But on making a pilgrimage to the Vatican in Rome, he discovers a corrupt and bloated Church and a degenerate and cynical priesthood. The experience leads him to the writing of the 95 Theses, a call to arms against religious corruption and a return to the gospels of Jesus Christ. Central to the theses is Luther&#8217;s attack on the Catholic Church&#8217;s selling of Indulgence which are meant to ensure a dying person&#8217;s passage to Heaven. In calling for a spiritual renewal of Christianity, Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses lay the foundations for Protestantism. In episode two, &#8220;The Reluctant Revolutionary&#8221;, the Catholic Church responds to Luther&#8217;s attacks by charging him with heresy. But a fortunate historic confluence - the invention of the printing press - allows for the first time the wide dissemination of Luther&#8217;s ideas and beliefs which find popular support all across Europe. Luther attacks the Church hierarchy at his trial and his protests leads to revolutionary upheaval across the continent. The episode examines both Luther&#8217;s radical impact but also his refusal to support the peasant revolutionaries inspired by his rhetoric. Luther can imagine a spiritual revolutionary order but not an economic revolution. His vehement and ruthless attacks against the poor, the peasantry and against the Jews will resonate in Protestantism through the ages and lead to a tension in the Christian faiths which will see Catholicism brave the Reformation and paradoxically regain strength in the modern world as the Christian Church for the poor and the oppressed.

Whatever the contradictions of his faith and life, the religious revolution inspired by Luther is undoubtedly one of the greatest singular moments in European history.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Vatican City", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Printing - History", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Anti-semitism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholic Church", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Freedom of religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Monks", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Philosophy and religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Protestantism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and state", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Black death", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History - 1517-1871", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Monks", "History&nbsp;→ Peasant uprisings", "History&nbsp;→ Printing - History", "History&nbsp;→ Reformation", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Printing - History", "People&nbsp;→ Luther, Martin, 1483-1546", "Places&nbsp;→ Vatican City", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2234014, "name": "Cassian Harrison", "creator_id": 35097, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2234010, "name": "Cassian Harrison", "creator_id": 35097, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2234007, "name": "Richard Bradley", "creator_id": 35365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2234005, "name": "Lion Television", "creator_id": 35361, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2234001, "name": "Devillier Donegan Enterprises", "creator_id": 36154, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233996, "name": "Public Broadcasting Service (U.S.)", "creator_id": 30578, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233993, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115602, "acmi_id": "S01443", "title": "Empires", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "empires", "creator_credit": "Devillier Donegan Enterprises and Public Broadcasting Service (U.S.)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93558, "acmi_id": "317063", "title": "Egypt's golden empire.

In episode one, &#8220;Order from Chaos&#8221; the Roman Republic has collapsed into the century-long chaos of civil war. Julius Caesar&#8217;s victories have led to the expansion of the Empire. But with Caesar&#8217;s murder in the senate, Augustus is made Emperor and the beginning of a hereditary dictatorship is put in place. Augustus&#8217; rule results in the further expansion of the Empire and the rise of Roman art and architecture but his sometimes ruthless squashing of enemies foretell the problems that will lie ahead for the empire. In episode two, &#8220;Years of Trial&#8221;, we begin with the death of Augustus in 14 AD. Tiberius becomes emperor and though initially popular, he soon shows signs of tyranny. The fortunes of Roman citizenship are viewed through the eyes of the poet Ovid. The life of Roman citizens becomes even more horrific with the ascendancy of Caligula as Emperor, whose madness manifests itself in the belief that he is a God and whose excesses become increasingly sadistic and dangerous for Rome. In the Eastern province of Judaea a religious prophet named Jesus brings Roman occupation and Jewish resistance to loggerheads. In episode three, &#8220;Winds of Change&#8221;, the terror of Caligula&#8217;s reign is replaced by the provident and wise rule of Claudius. But the decadence of hereditary rule results in his murder by his unscrupulous wife who places her son Nero on the throne. The new Emperor is tutored by the Stoic philosopher, Senenca. By witnessing the accommodations to power that Seneca makes - at odds with his egalitarian philosophy - we witness the tensions of Roman citizenship, with a past built on Republican grandeur and a present built on hereditary empire. At the outposts of the empire, the English warrior queen Boudicca (Bodicea) wars against the Romans who massacred her family and kin, and in Judaea the Jewish zealot Saul is converted to Christianity, and as Saint Paul begins a missionary life that will see Christianity spread through the Roman Empire. In the final episode, &#8220;Years of Eruption&#8221;, the city of Rome is besieged by fire and Nero is put to death for his calamitous excesses. A new period of civil wars begins and Vestpatian is finally made Emperor. The kingdom of Judaea is crushed and the Temple in Jerusalem is destroyed. The city of Pompeii is buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius but with its excavation in the 1600s we have a permanent record of Roman art and life: that of the nobles and that of the slaves, that of the women and of the men.

In a desert world consisting of warring nomadic tribes, differences were only put aside when the tribes congregated in the holy city of Mecca to worship their individual gods and totems. From this centre of trade and religion, the Prophet Muhammad first began to receive visions from the one God. Though initially exiled by his opponents, Muhammad finds refuge in the oasis of Medina, and there he builds up a strong and loyal following united, for the first time, not by blood but by faith.

The religion leads to a democratisation of society and a flourishing of art, architecture, philosophy and science as the Muslim scholars integrate the thoughts of the ancient Greeks with the philosophy arising from Islam.

Aubrey Smith. A young woman who moves from America to England with her father, meets and falls in love with Sir John Ashwood (Alan Marshal), an English baronet. They marry, and Susan soon falls pregnant, but tragically loses her husband to World War I before her son, John junior is born. Despite the prospect of isolation, she decides to remain in England (young son played by Roddy McDowall, adult son by Peter Lawford). Susan&#8217;s painful relationship with war and tragedy is relived years later when her son expresses a wish to go to war like his father. Reluctantly she agrees, as well as becoming a volunteer with the Red Cross. Once again, a mother&#8217;s love is placed in the hands of fate as the waiting game begins.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1992960, "name": "Clarence Brown", "creator_id": 76344, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q435029", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992959, "name": "Sidney A.

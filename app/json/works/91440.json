The four bind themselves into a formal coven one afternoon and cast their first spell as a group: Rochelle asks for revenge on a racist class-mate, Sarah asks that Chris fall in love with her, Bonnie asks for the severe burn scars that cover her body to be removed, and Nancy asks for all the power of Manon. Empowered by Sarah, a natural witch, their spells have the desired results, and the group becomes more close-knit as they continue their occult explorations. Feeling guilty about what she has done to Chris, Sarah seeks advice from the proprietor of the local occult shop, Lirio, who advises the group to be careful, as whatever they send out will return to them times three. The others ignore this advice and group leader Nancy soon becomes corrupted by the powers she is given after a midnight invocation on a stormy beach, resulting in the death of Chris.

Caught in a struggle between reality and illusion, Sarah is forced to invoke a greater power to help defend her against Nancy&#8217;s maliciously twisted magic.

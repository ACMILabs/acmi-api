The two leading characters - a widow (Nobuko Otowa) and her daughter-in-law (Yitsuko Yoshimura) are engaged in just such a racket. Shindo spares us none of the details: victims are speared, stripped and unceremoniously dumped in the concealed pit that hides the evidence of their crime. A samurai, separated from his troops, stumbles into the lakeside village bizarrely clad in the mask of a demon. He wears it, he says, to protect his handsome features from the ravages of war. Like many before him, he is slain and his mask is purloined and used by the widow to terrify her daughter-in-law, of whose unabashed sexuality she is jealous. But the plan misfires, the mask shrinks and clings to her face and when it has to be forcibly released, it discloses the worst horror of all. Music by Mitsu Hayashi. In Japanese with English Subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Folk literature, Japanese", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Drama, Medieval"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2354705, "name": "Kaneto Shindo", "creator_id": 30326, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354701, "name": "Hisao Itoya", "creator_id": 78825, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270744", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354696, "name": "Kazuo Kuwahara", "creator_id": 78823, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222736", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354703, "name": "Setsuo Noto", "creator_id": 78826, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126726", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354698, "name": "Tamotsu Minato", "creator_id": 78824, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126215", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354686, "name": "Kindai Eiga Kyokai", "creator_id": 30320, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6410530", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354689, "name": "Toho Kabushiki Kaisha", "creator_id": 22350, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2354692, "name": "Tokyo Eiga Company", "creator_id": 30321, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079435", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2354683, "name": "Movie Mail", "creator_id": 78819, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45144", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [27713]}, {"id": 78722, "acmi_id": "017412", "title": "The Homecoming", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-homecoming", "creator_credit": "Matthew Lovering, Tony McDonald and Swinburne Institute of Technology.

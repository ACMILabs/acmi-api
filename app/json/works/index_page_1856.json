Suspended in time, a man hovers in a frozen, midair leap over the water, as subtle techniques of still-framing and multiple keying join disparate layers of time into a single coherent image. Viola writes that &#8216;the piece concerns the emergence of the individual into the natural world &#8212; a kind of baptism.&#8217; He describes Moonblood as <code>an expression of the feminine principle, a work in three parts relating to a personal concept of woman and mother. Day and night converge within the silhouette of a woman at a window &amp;#8212; a rushing waterfall in winter, and the serene interplay of changing dawn light unfolds within a glass of water at dawn in the desert.&amp;#8217; Silent Life&amp;#8217; records the first hours and days of life through a series of portraits of newborn babies in a hospital nursery. The alienating hospital environment, and the vulnerability of the babies&amp;#8217; pre-lingual gestures and expressions, suggests a primal linking of birth and death. Ancient of Days is a remarkable series of</code>canons and fugues for video&#8217; that comprises Viola&#8217;s most sophisticated structural and metaphorical explorations of time. Mathematical notations of precise time-code editing were applied to construct illustrations of temporal symmetry, duality and transposition &#8212; time-based equivalents of musical compositional principles such as counterpoint and serialism. Astonishing temporal interventions &#8212; a 180-degree pan gazing downward on a New York City street that progresses from day to night, an image of Mount Rainier in which the foreground and background unfold in different time planes &#8212; unfold as symbolic transformations of natural and urban landscapes.

are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap. The family spend time at the beach and Karen celebrates her fourth birthday.</p>\n<p>Scenes of the Melbourne Zoo show the difference in standards for zoological practices between the 1960s and contemporary practices.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:23:00 view of houses in the arid setting of Alice Springs<br />\n00:01:15:00 mountain scenery seen across the scrubby desert<br />\n00:01:49:00 memorial for ‘Flynn of the Inland’<br />\n00:02:22:00 Dorothy wearing a very 1960s style ‘sunsuit’ for hot weather<br />\n00:02:30:00 children playing in a portable backyard swimming pool<br />\n00:03:16:00 views of rocks and a creek followed by Alice Springs township from a higher vantage point<br />\n00:04:50:00 (faint) carvings on a rock face<br />\n00:05:15:00 ‘John Flynn Church’<br />\n00:05:25:00 cars in Alice Springs<br />\n00:05:56:00 Karen wearing sunglasses<br />\n00:06:40:00 views around an Indigenous settlement<br />\n00:07:11:00 children eating watermelon<br />\n00:07:28:00 floods in the outback<br />\n00:07:45:00 TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) airplane on the tarmac at an outback airport<br />\n00:07:53:00 propeller of flying plane and views of the sea and land below, followed by landing scenes<br />\n00:08:51:00 scenes of baby Stuart at home in Herne Hill, Geelong<br />\n00:09:50:00 baby Stuart in a ‘bouncinette’ and in his ‘bassinette’<br />\n00:11:55:00 Les and Karen with baby Stuart<br />\n00:12:42:00 Dorothy in a Ford ‘Cortina’ model car<br />\n00:13:29:00 scenes at the beach<br />\n00:14:03:00 Karen and companion buried in the sand at the beach<br />\n00:15:48:00 scenes at the Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:16:33:00 Karen’s fourth birthday celebrations<br />\n00:17:13:00 baby Stuart almost crawling across the carpet<br />\n00:18:08:00 Karen shows a popular activity of the time – the &#8216;hula hoop&#8217;<br />\n00:18:45:00 Stuart in a crate on the back of a bicycle<br />\n00:18:47:00 Karen shows off her &#8216;cowgirl&#8217; outfit<br />\n00:19:17:00 baby Stuart walking<br />\n00:19:31:00 Karen and baby brother Stuart on a tricycle (trike)<br />\n00:21:00:00 baby Stuart walking with a toy lawn mower, on his tricycle and with Karen showing off a new outfit<br />\n00:21:37:00 at the beach and in the water<br />\n00:22:21:00 Dorothy and the children in new outfits in red and orange<br />\n00:23:06:00 late 1960s or early 1970s wedding<br />\n00:23:28:00 Les in 1970s style shorts and long socks<br />\n00:24:04:00 a &#8216;Victa&#8217; brand lawn mower<br />\n00:25:30:00 garden scenes<br />\n00:25:40:00 a cricket game</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 2]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Dorothy Nixon and Les Nixon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1966</p>", "description": "<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film Les and Dorothy Nixon show off their first baby Karen (who features in the Nixon Collection until she is an adult herself) at their home in Herne Hill, Geelong, Victoria. There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking.

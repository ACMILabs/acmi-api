As a starting point, he begins with the question, &#8220;Who is Albert Woo?&#8221; a character he played in the film &#8220;Foreign ghost&#8221;. Director and narrator Hoe draws on comments by Asian men from all sectors of life, including a performer, a musician, a businessman, a war veteran and, interestingly, a yo-yo champion. The men talk candidly of their experiences with racism, their role models, their sexuality, what they consider to be truisms of men in their race, how they feel about the issue of inter-racial marriages and the historical segregation of those who have made this choice. One woman, an ex love of Hoe&#8217;s, is interviewed on her view on whether/why Asian women are more attracted to non-Asians than men of their own race. On his journey Hoe travels to Golden Studios to speak at length with Jackie Chan, as well as providing a brief overview of his genealogy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnic attitudes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnic groups", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Race discrimination", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Group identity", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Group identity", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Stereotype (Psychology)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 882881, "name": "Hunt Hoe", "creator_id": 80252, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q65970008", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1815636, "name": "Germaine Ying Gee Wong", "creator_id": 80251, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126353", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882879, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 882878, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50947", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32894]}, {"id": 78349, "acmi_id": "016947", "title": "Who gets hurt?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "who-gets-hurt", "creator_credit": "Ron Tanner, David Evans and Millbank Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A fictionalised drama that looks at safety in the workplace.

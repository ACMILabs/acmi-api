David Brent, a delusional manager who believes himself to be witty, universally adored, efficient and effective, runs the branch. Series two sees the office of Slough merging with Swindon. In an attempt to win his new staff over, David utilises his trademark off-colour humour. But his attempt at ingratiation only serves to alienate staff. Brent also has a new boss, Neil, a genuinely appealing, popular and efficient manager who stands for none of Brent&#8217;s inadequacy.

Ep 6: Dawn is conflicted over her future and her romantic life. Adhering to a mockumentary structure, a camera crew follow the workers around, documenting office life - boredom, bad jokes, uncomfortable moments, embarrassing faux pas and the emptiness of at work interactions that pass the day.

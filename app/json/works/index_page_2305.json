In 1949 Life Magazine had asked the question of whether Pollock was the greatest living painter in the United States? This film replies to the question by showing that in many ways it was the foisting of exactly such demands on Pollock that contributed to his psychological distress and to his eventual death through alcoholism when he was only forty-four. The film aptly documents both Pollock&#8217;s frenzied artistic activity as well as his turbulent emotional life. It also effectively conveys the world of the Manhattan art scene in the mid-twentieth century, at the point where New York City was the most artistically exciting city in the world. Though the necessity of the biography genre requires the narrative to undertake certain conventional tropes - struggle, early success, alcoholism, disillusionment and death - the fierce commitment of director Harris to his subject results in a film that arguably does justice to Pollock&#8217;s immense, fiery talents.

By 221 BC, after centuries of civil war, seven kingdoms were dominant in China. At this time the ruler of the kingdom of Qin, Ying Zheng (Li Xuejian), raised to believe he had an ancestral duty to unify all of China, undertook a brutal conquest to achieve his goal, thus becoming the country&#8217;s first emperor. In this interpretation Zheng is aided in his quest by his lover, Lady Zhao (Gong Li), who devises a fake assassination plot to justify an invasion of the neighboring kingdom of Yan, enlisting the help of Yan assassin Jing Ke (Zhang Fengyi) who is trying to give up his bloody past. As the King becomes increasingly ruthless and bloodthirsty, Lady Zhao shifts her political and romantic allegiances to the assassin. Filled with the back-stabbing imperial politics, murderous betrayals, acts of cruelty and bloody mass slaughter usually associated with Shakespearean tragedy, the emotional impact and tension of the complex narrative is at times dwarfed by the elaborately staged, large-scale battle sequences and the visual grandeur of the landscape. Written by Chen Kaige and Wang Peigong.

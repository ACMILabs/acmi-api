As the regular teacher leaves he promises Wei bonus pay if, upon his return, all the students are still in school. Inexperienced and overwhelmed, but relentlessly stubborn, Wei faces ingratitude and her own misery as she grapples with the recalcitrant students. When one boy is sent to work in the city, where he lives on the street, Wei pursues him. Once there Wei is overwhelmed by the crowds, bustling street life and enormity of the task of finding a young boy amid the vast city and innumerable homeless children who reside there.

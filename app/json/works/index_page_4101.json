His Film &#8220;Napoleon&#8221; (1927), in particular, is an encyclopaedia of film techniques. &#8220;The Charm of Dynamite&#8221; uses sequences from &#8220;Napoleon&#8221; (1927), &#8220;La roue (1923) and &#8220;J&#8217;accuse&#8221; (1919) to show the genius of this man. This documentary narrated by Lindsay Anderson and directed by Kevin Brownlow also includes Abel Gance in interview and some amazing behind the scenes footage of the techniques used in making his films. Director and film historian Brownlow would later reconstruct &#8220;Napoleon&#8221; for a revival premiere in 1980.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Gance, Abel", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ History", "People&nbsp;→ Gance, Abel", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816243, "name": "Barrie Gavin", "creator_id": 16416, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 861435, "name": "Rath Films", "creator_id": 19080, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 861437, "name": "Kevin Brownlow", "creator_id": 75579, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31054", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [14803], "external_references": []}, {"id": 116479, "acmi_id": "X001098", "title": "Abel Gance: Hier et Demain", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "abel-gance-hier-et-demain", "creator_credit": "Nelly Kaplan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1963", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In this documentary narrated by Abel Gance and directed by his former assistant (and filmmaker) Nelly Kaplan, the great director reminisces about his career which started in the silent era.

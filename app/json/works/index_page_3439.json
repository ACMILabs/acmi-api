Extensive footage from MacGowan&#8217;s past, in particular performances from the 1970s and 80s, presents an artist influenced by the traditions of Irish music and song, but also spurred on by the anti-establishment ethos and damaging excesses of the Punk Rock movement. Sarah Share presents an honest and compelling portrait of an evidently talented musician whose addiction to drugs and alcohol has seriously impeded his ambition and ability to maintain stability, in life and in his art. Songs featured include: Paddy public enemy No 1, If I should fall from grace with God, Infatuation, Gabrielle, Waxie&#8217;s dargle, Streams of whiskey, Dirty old town, The Irish rover, Fiesta, A Rainy night in Soho, Fairytale in New York, White city, Summer in Siam, Song with no name, That woman&#8217;s got me drinking, Haunted and Lonesome highway.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Ireland", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Alcohol use", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - Ireland", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 928840, "name": "Irish Film Board", "creator_id": 22054, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928841, "name": "TG4", "creator_id": 36193, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928842, "name": "Emdee 2000 Productions", "creator_id": 36194, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928843, "name": "Sarah Share", "creator_id": 80722, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 928839, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52173", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 27, "name": "Ireland", "slug": "ireland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33792], "external_references": []}, {"id": 118139, "acmi_id": "", "title": "If at first you don’t succeed", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "if-at-first-you-dont-succeed", "creator_credit": "Celeste Barber", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2018", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2021-04-01", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Digital screen recording from @CelesteBarber's Instagram", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2018-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Since 2015, Celeste Barber&#8217;s resisted the swarm of unattainable  images on social media with her #celestechallengeaccepted project, an experiment to see how normal people look recreating the perfectly staged poses of the rich and Insta-famous</p>", "constellations_primary": [{"id": 296, "name": "If at first you don't succeed", "description": "Though originally intended as a laugh, Celeste Baber’s social media posts have become examples of body positivity to her eight million followers and challenge the absurd expectations put on women in society."}], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>If at first you don’t succeed</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Celeste Barber</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2018</p>", "description": "<p><b>This video features in a responsive display in the museum that presents the moments, stories and memes capturing the zeitgeist by going viral on the internet.</b></p>\n<p>Smartphones aren’t a mirror, but the images and videos influencers and celebrities post on social media can seem like standards we should reflect.

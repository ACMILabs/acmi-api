This film also served to establish Jean Gabin as a major star. A romantic, atmospheric thriller, it was crucial to the development of &#8216;French film noir&#8217; and inspired a number of remakes and many imitations. Duvivier admitted that &#8216;Pepe&#8217; was inspired by American ganster films, especially Howard Hawks&#8217; &#8216;Scarface&#8217;. In &#8216;Pepe&#8217;, the gangster Max who plays the cup-and-ball is a reminder of the coin-tossing ganster played by Georges Raft in &#8216;Scarface&#8217;. The Algiers Casbah was fully reconstituted in studio. A few exteriors were shot on location in Sete and Marseilles. Only a few establishing shot were filmed in Algiers. &#8216;Pepe le Moko&#8217; was remade in the US as &#8216;Algiers&#8217; (1938) and as &#8216;Casbah&#8217; (1948).

The &#8216;happy families&#8217; scenario begins to come apart however when the crew begin to get more reckless with their crimes, while falling heavier into drug use. Larry Clark (whose past photographic essays on teenagers inform most of his film work), adopts his usual languid style as the camera casually drifts over young bodies, their boredom only slightly elevated by sporadic bursts of violence. In contrast, James Woods gives his familiar intense performance, while Melanie Griffith imbues her role with a unselfconscious charm as the junkie substitute &#8216;mother&#8217; for this ill-fated family. Cast includes: Lou Diamond Philips, Peter Sarsgaard.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "French", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2097852, "name": "Larry Clark", "creator_id": 71719, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q714496", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2097851, "name": "Larry Clark", "creator_id": 71719, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q714496", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2097846, "name": "James Woods", "creator_id": 80713, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q193105", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2097844, "name": "Stephen Chin", "creator_id": 80712, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2097839, "name": "Chinese Bookie pictures", "creator_id": 36176, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2097836, "name": "MRA Entertainment", "creator_id": 80709, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52152", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33771]}, {"id": 92592, "acmi_id": "315891", "title": "Annie Leibovitz", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "annie-leibovitz", "creator_credit": "Rebecca Frayn, Belinda Allen, RM Arts and LWT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Formulated on the occasion of a major retrospective on the work of renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz at the International Center of Photography, New York, which toured internationally, this documentary explores Leibovitz&#8217;s career from the 1960s to the 1990s and discusses a wide range of her most celebrated work during this time.

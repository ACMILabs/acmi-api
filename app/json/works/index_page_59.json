Rather than attempting a literal explanation of the enduring appeal of Warhol&#8217;s art, and the public&#8217;s fascination with the fabulous nobodies who populated his New York studio, the filmmaker presents a meditation on fame and celebrity, exploring the zeitgeist of the times. Features many intriguing archival interviews with Warhol, which exacerbates his image as a vacuous artist, whilst failing to expose the man behind the myth. Also investigates Warhol&#8217;s films that confounded cinemagoers of the day. The unpretentiousness of Warhol&#8217;s Pennsylvanian family, who are interviewed at length, contrasts with his high-profile celebrity laden life in New York.

Unfortunately God- who happens to be a woman- has failed to return from her monthly visit to earth to play arcade games. As a result the fate of the human race relies on the last descendent of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who has lost her faith. Metatron (Alan Rickman), a Seraphim and the voice of God, informs Bethany of her responsibilities and that she will be assisted by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and his hetro-life partner Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith). The unlikely trio head to New Jersey, to stop Bartleby and Loki from entering the church, because if they do, they will have proven God fallible and will wipe out all human existence. Along their way they are assisted by Rufus (Chris Rock), the 13th apostle, who claims he was left out of the bible for political reasons (and that Jesus owes him $12) and Serendipity (Salma Hayek), a muse with writers block. Cast also includes George Carlin, Jason Lee, Bud Cort, Jeff Anderson, Brian O&#8217;Halloran, Janeane Garofalo and Alanis Morissette as God.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholic Church", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 23}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997094, "name": "Kevin Smith", "creator_id": 5359, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997093, "name": "Scott Mosier", "creator_id": 29818, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q354010", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997092, "name": "View Askew Productions", "creator_id": 29817, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997091, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50648", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32624], "external_references": [{"id": 24136, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q40187"}]}]}

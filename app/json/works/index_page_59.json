It was produced using a game engine as its base, and worked up from the real architectural designs produced for Federation Square by Lab Architecture Studio.</p>\n<p>Designed as a soundpark, it is a musical instrument which can be played collectively, and, like Federation Square itself, it was envisaged as a kind of public space waiting for a community to define its meaning.</p>\n<p>It was conceived as an experiment in the design of a virtual public space. It is an embodiment of the idea that we are moving our public space into the realm of the virtual. By using a model of a real world public space combined with the collaborative possibilities of the soundpark and the kinaesthetic pleasures of moving through a beautiful virtual place, selectparks hoped to build upon traditional concepts of ‘public’ places.</p>\n<p>[Source: Helen Stuckey, 2006 https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1561/1476  last accessed 20/10/2020]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Game"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["software, computers, monitors, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1336866, "name": "Selectparks", "creator_id": 8849, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1336870, "name": "Wayne Simmons", "creator_id": 73487, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "programmer", "role_id": 483, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1336869, "name": "Andrea Blundell", "creator_id": 73486, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "animator", "role_id": 497, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1336868, "name": "Chad Chatterton", "creator_id": 73485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1336867, "name": "Julian Holland Oliver", "creator_id": 73484, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "principal", "role_id": 461, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1908", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [48225]}, {"id": 108650, "acmi_id": "B1003854", "title": "Spitfire 123", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "spitfire-123", "creator_credit": "Lyndal Jones", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1996", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "video, monitors, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The third in an ongoing six-part series collectively titled &#8216;From the Darwin Translations&#8217;.

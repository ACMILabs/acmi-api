The three strands are linked by a horrendous car accident that also symbolises the frenetic and explosive nature of life in this urban jungle. The first story focuses on the young Octavio (played by Gael Garcia Bernal), who is also entangled in the local dog-fighting scene, his infatuation with his sister-in-law, a young mother juggling school and an adulterous, criminal husband.

If its &#8216;life lessons&#8217; are at times cliched and heavy-handed, the film is still an engaging, commanding experience. In Spanish with English subtitles.

Divided into three separate but overlapping narratives (a la Altman and Tarantino), each explores themes of loss, survival, despair and the constant battle of life and change. The three strands are linked by a horrendous car accident that also symbolises the frenetic and explosive nature of life in this urban jungle. The first story focuses on the young Octavio (played by Gael Garcia Bernal), who is also entangled in the local dog-fighting scene, his infatuation with his sister-in-law, a young mother juggling school and an adulterous, criminal husband. The second centres on supermodel, Valeria (Goya Toldeo), whose life is turned asunder when she is seriously hurt and the strain this places on her relationship with a man who has just left his wife and children for her. Finally, the last and most poetic narrative strand centres on a former political fighter now a homeless, contracted hitman who longs for his family.

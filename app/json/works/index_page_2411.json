One was the journey of the Olympic Torch and the other was a walk by group of people carrying a sacred fire with them, who wanted to spread the message of peace.<br />\nThis documentary explores the beginnings of both journeys. It presents the start of the Olympic Torch relay through another perspective and shows what wasn&#8217;t seen by a global Olympic audience - a walk by a small group of people from the the shores of Lake Eyre to Sydney to raise awareness about nuclear issues and promote peace.<br />\nThe decision to do some filming was made in Coober Pedy two days before the Olympic Torch Relay commenced. In an old Subaru station wagon, Melbourne-based Sam de Silva, Michael Lumsdon and &#8216;Fergus&#8217; travelled to Uluru, Alice Springs and Lake Eyre Peace Camp over a period of 3 days to document the story of the Olympic Flame and the Peace Fire.<br />\nAn Access News story.

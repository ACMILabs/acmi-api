Coppola paid his homage to it in the opening half-hour of &#8220;The Godfather&#8221;, as did Cimino in &#8220;The Deerhunter&#8221; (Cimino also was clearly influenced by &#8220;The Leopard&#8221; when making &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Gate&#8221;. What he failed to capture was the operatic emotional power of Visconti&#8217;s film - nor did he have Visconti&#8217;s rigorous intellectual and political understanding of history and social forces). Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;The Age of Innocence&#8221; and Altman&#8217;s &#8220;Gosford Park&#8221; also owe a debt to Visconti&#8217;s vision and mise-en-scene. The romantic music is by Nino Rota. The exquisite clothes are by Piero Tosi. The film&#8217;s reputation continues to grow and it is now considered one of the masterpieces of world cinema.

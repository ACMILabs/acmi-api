Drawing on the rich aesthetic and narrative veins within the audio-visual archive, a mobile and layered narrative world is created whereby the archive is not only not lost, but in fact is dramatically re-born through an examination of the sensory deprivations that make the archive so ephemeral, and the circumstances of its production so particular.</p>\n<p>Planet Usher unpacks the taken-for-granted relationship between sound and image in our everyday lives, whilst exploring their asynchronous relation in this instance as a source of emergent stories about a deaf man going blind. Planet Usher&#8217;s aural and visual aesthetic is low-tech high fidelity, evocatively rendering the degradation of memory, and more especially, of the physical senses as they are affected by Usher Syndrome.

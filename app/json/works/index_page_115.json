Instead, it operates more or less like a real-world camera, with each photo taken from the character’s perspective.</p>\n<p>Ian MacLarty described lining up the perfect shot as ‘like a game in itself’, requiring a lifelike combination of precision and luck to capture the perfect angle and quality of light.</p>\n<p>These photos, so lovingly framed and shot, have a radical undertone. Their explorations could be considered a kind of psychogeography – an artistic practice that involved exploring urban environments to emphasise personal responses to place, rather than focusing on productivity or purpose.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the images captured here showcase The Grannies’ emotional, playful relationship with digital space that contradicts the intended design of the game.</p>\n<p>Since they were taken, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> has been updated to stop players from travelling outside the map. Still, these images remain, a reminder of the freedom that curiosity and exploration can offer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Visuals captured by The Grannies from Red Dead Redemption 2<br />\nRockstar Games, USA, 2018<br />\nText by Kalonica Quigley</p>", "details": [{"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Digital", "Photographic print/Pictorial"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1913492, "name": "The", "creator_id": 87012, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 121840, "acmi_id": "", "title": "Out of Bounds", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "out-of-bounds", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 3", "last_on_display_date": "2023-04-23", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": true, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 121843, "acmi_id": "", "title": "Red Desert Render", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "red-desert-render", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "<p>Courtesy Ian MacLarty</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 3", "last_on_display_date": "2023-04-23", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2019-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}, {"id": 121841, "acmi_id": "", "title": "The Grannies", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-grannies", "creator_credit": "Luke Neher, Marie Foulston and Nick Murray", "credit_line": "<p>Music by Sam Gill and Luke Neher.

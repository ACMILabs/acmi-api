There are also scenes of children playing in a Mirror or possibly a Sabot sailing boat dry-docked in a suburban back yard.</p>\n<p>There are sequences of slalom ski events, chair lift and poma lift rides, and family leisure time spent inside the ski lodge.</p>\n<p>We see ski races with slalom pole banners with “Molony Ski Shop&#8221; signage, and &#8220;Start&#8221; and “Finish” banners and flags with “Henke Schuhe” signage. A ski instructor wearing a red Parka teaching parallel turns. The old ski jump is visible down the valley.</p>\n<p>A group of family and friends go down the Valley of the Moon ski run. A child navigates the tricky bits, then skis along the narrow raceline to the village. We see currawongs in the trees, a village, and return on the chairlift.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker experiments with some in-camera slow-motion techniques, and amongst the crowd of onlookers and prize givers, we see people using what could be a Standard 8 camera or a 16mm Bolex camera, as well as 35mm SLR cameras.</p>\n<p>There are some beautiful ski scenes filmed against blue skies amongst eucalypts and beside streams. A high shot provides an excellent view of the slalom course with flags and banners. We see a lovely panorama of green hills patched with snow in the background and views of the ski feild from the Snowhaven deck.</p>\n<p>The film shows some great scenes of a man in charge of a “Snow mobile” as he starts it up and tows four skiers behind him. They traverse the beautiful snow-covered countryside in formation, across towards Mt McKay. Looking down over Sun Valley and a very long tow queue.</p>\n<p>In a suburban backyard seemingly far from the snow fields, the film shows two children playing in a dry-docked Fireball sailing boat. We see the young boy strapped into the boat’s flying trapeze harness as he swings from the edge of the boat. The children play with a toy ambulance and ride down the street (Cleeve Court) on their bicycles. Along the street, we see vintage cars and suburban houses.</p>\n<p>This film has good examples of ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era.</p>\n<p>The footage of the Falls Creek landscape is a good historical reflection of the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s. There are also good examples of a suburban street scape, children’s toys and sailing boats used for recreation.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made on 16mm.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00: 05:22:00 High shot of finish line, flags and skiers<br />\n00:13:47:00 Skiing alongside a stream<br />\n00:14:00:00 Skiers in single file navigate a narrow path<br />\n00:16:37:00 Women and children ski downhill towards the ski village<br />\n00:20:16:00 A young boy boards the poma tow<br />\n00:20:53:00 Children playing in Fireball sailing boat<br />\n00:23:05:00 Snow Cruiser driver starts the engine<br />\n00:23:57:00 Skiers in formation behind Snow Cruiser<br />\n00:25:20:00 Skiers single file behind Snow Cruiser</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:46:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Falls Creek (Vic.)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Snow", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boats and boating", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sailing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ski racing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Skiers", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Skis and skiing", "Places&nbsp;→ Falls Creek (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2374641, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178640", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1966-1967", "notes": "", "to_year": "1966-1967"}], "labels": [59202]}]}

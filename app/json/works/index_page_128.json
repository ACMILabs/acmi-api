Paul (Jonathan Warden), Jon (Robert De Niro) and Lloyd (Geritt Graham) present as gay and extreme right-wingers to the army all the while trying their best to seduce women to keep themselves occupied. This is a witty and satirical view of American culture at the time and is more a series of fun episodes in the protagonists&#8217; lives than a straight-forward narrative.

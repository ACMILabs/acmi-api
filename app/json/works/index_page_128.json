Suffering the effects of this crushing oversight, Graham inadvertently pushes a panhandler into the oncoming path of a subway train, killing the man instantly. Charged with murder, Graham is released on manslaughter. This leads him to speculate on the possibility of repeating his actions - murder, camouflaged as accident - and plots to get back at some of his enemies, starting at home with his shrewish wife (Swoosie Kurtz). The downtrodden suit has turned into a likeable avenger. This parable of corporate greed in post 1980s Wall Street is a curious mix of thriller and black comedy. Cast also includes Will Patton as the obligatory gumshoe and Elizabeth McGovern as the sympathetic co-worker and love interest.

Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush give exceptional performances as Helfgott, while Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays David&#8217;s father is outstanding. &#8220;Shine&#8221; was a triumph internationally for both the Australian film industry and the relaunching of Helfgott&#8217;s career. It is also a testament to the courage of human beings facing adversity and overcome it. Geoffrey Rush received an Academy Award for his outstanding performance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Helfgott, David, 1947-", "People&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/shine", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954400, "name": "Momentum Films", "creator_id": 27565, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954401, "name": "Jane Scott", "creator_id": 19966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954402, "name": "Scott Hicks", "creator_id": 19844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954399, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41547", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [25040], "external_references": [{"id": 5383, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "7863"}]}, {"id": 92133, "acmi_id": "315343", "title": "Sherman's march: a meditation on the possibility of romantic love in the South during an era of nuclear weapons proliferation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shermans-march-a-meditation-on-the-possibility-of-romantic-love-in-the-south-during-an-era-of-nuclear-weapons-proliferation", "creator_credit": "Ross McElwee", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1986", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A journey by the filmmaker through the South follows the route of the Union&#8217;s General Sherman who carried on the war against the civilian population of the Confederacy, then largely female.

A fairly stilted and straightforward morality drama, this film has an almost transparent agenda, is patriarchal, traditionalist and simplistic in its politics. Nevertheless the film is a curiosity that is telling about the values of the era and perceived threat that teenagers under the influence posed to the status quo. Cast includes Luana Walters, Arthur Gardner, Fay McKenzie, Michael Owen, Dorothy Short, Dorothy Vaughan, Earl Dwire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Exploitation films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Reporters and reporting", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs - Side effects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marihuana", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "History&nbsp;→ Propaganda"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/assassin-of-youth", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2102529, "name": "Elmer Clifton", "creator_id": 32530, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q195029", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102527, "name": "Leo McCarthy", "creator_id": 35509, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036016", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102523, "name": "B C M Productions", "creator_id": 35508, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034710", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2102520, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51314", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1937", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1937"}], "labels": [33169]}]}

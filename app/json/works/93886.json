It is recognised that humans and apes share 98% of the same DNA. But could life have evolved differently out there in the cosmos? Astrophysicists, geologists, biochemists, astronomers, and biopalaeontologists discuss their theories and discoveries, both on Earth and in space, to help shed some light on this mystery of life.

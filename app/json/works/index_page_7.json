Looking down over Sun Valley and a very long tow queue.</p>\n<p>In a suburban backyard seemingly far from the snow fields, the film shows two children playing in a dry-docked Fireball sailing boat. We see the young boy strapped into the boat’s flying trapeze harness as he swings from the edge of the boat. The children play with a toy ambulance and ride down the street (Cleeve Court) on their bicycles. Along the street, we see vintage cars and suburban houses.</p>\n<p>This film has good examples of ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era.</p>\n<p>The footage of the Falls Creek landscape is a good historical reflection of the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.

Footage seen in recent days include protestors fighting with authorities in high-rise stairways (embedded below) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1596687049901637632\">medical authorities patrolling daily Covid tests with machine guns</a>. However, without the usual verification methods used by traditional media outlets, it&#8217;s hard to be certain of the authenticity of videos. Meanwhile, anti-lockdown activists in other countries have been quick to point out that many countries suppressed anti-lockdown protests.</p>\n<p>The uprisings are being likened to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

All goes well until Grace has to deal with the seedy trading of the goods and the attentions of the local constabulary. &#8220;Saving Grace&#8221;, directed by Nigel Cole, can probably best be described as quirky feel-good English comedy with a touch of dark humour nudging the sides; it also has undertones of female liberation as Grace gains empowerment over her life. Brenda Blethyn is credible as Grace but the comedy flounders often as, despite some enjoyably anarchic moments, the narrative also calls for some dreadfully unlikely ones. Cast also includes: Craig Ferguson, Martin Clunes, Tcheky Karyo, and Jamie Forman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marihuana"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/saving-grace", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999687, "name": "Nigel Cole", "creator_id": 36740, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q365726", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999686, "name": "Mark Crowdy", "creator_id": 36739, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999683, "name": "Fine Line Features", "creator_id": 3881, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999684, "name": "Homerun Productions", "creator_id": 36738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999685, "name": "Portman Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 33541, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52680", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34160]}, {"id": 94653, "acmi_id": "318627", "title": "The Last time I saw Paris", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-time-i-saw-paris", "creator_credit": "Richard Brooks, Jack Cummings and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1954", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1954-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 43813, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1158191"}], "brief_description": "<p>Charles Wills (Van Johnson) is a GI with literary ambitions who goes to Paris and meets and falls in love with the wealthy Helen Ellswirth (Elizabeth Taylor).

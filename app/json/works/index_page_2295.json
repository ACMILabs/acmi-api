With a household as full and varied as hers, where the marginal mix with the straight, situations arise that require immediate action. For bootlegging, violence, and stealing, Rose hands out her own brand of justice. Even authority isn&#8217;t exempt: she becomes involved in a noisy dispute with a social worker over her son&#8217;s theft of a bicycle.

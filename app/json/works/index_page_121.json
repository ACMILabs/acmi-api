Based on David Steven&#8217;s award-winning play, &#8220;The Sum of Us&#8221; is a wonderful comedy about sons and fathers, a loving tribute to the tenderness and comraderie that can be found between men. Though some gay and lesbian critics disliked the film because of its obvious stage-bound script and the unashamed masculinity of Crowe&#8217;s gay son, by focussing on working class rather than bourgeois sexuality, &#8220;The Sum of Us&#8221; can also be seen as a film that radically redefines the boundaries of Australian masculinity and sexuality. Crowe makes a handsome and likeable central character and Jack Thompson is wonderful as the committed, generous father willing to do whatever it takes to make his son happy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1169874, "name": "Geoff Burton", "creator_id": 75852, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169873, "name": "Kevin Dowling", "creator_id": 79826, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169872, "name": "Hal McElroy", "creator_id": 66861, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169871, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169870, "name": "Southern Star Entertainment", "creator_id": 26294, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1169877, "name": "John Polson", "creator_id": 55317, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1169876, "name": "Russell Crowe", "creator_id": 79827, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1169875, "name": "Jack Thompson", "creator_id": 72924, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1169869, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19597, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3n1XRqAtQ7p0xW2O9J3WE1eIblx.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Sum of us  (Kevin Dowling; Geoff Burton) still", "credit_line": "Image via themoviedb.org", "alt_text": "", "width": 671, "height": 997, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49931", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [31951]}, {"id": 92458, "acmi_id": "49928", "title": "Breaker Morant [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "breaker-morant-dvd", "creator_credit": "Bruce Beresford, Matt Carroll and South Australian Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1980", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AkXj6t7ehSxqwYDRKxg7LKb8NgS.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>It is 1901, South Africa.

Features a guest appearance by Patti Smith, an artist who inspired Benjamin, and in the bonus footage, a live performance from Chan Marshall, aka Cat Power.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Arts", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ HIV (Viruses)", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Grunge music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2111667, "name": "Jem Cohen", "creator_id": 89, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6177037", "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111668, "name": "Peter Sillen", "creator_id": 80763, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111660, "name": "C-Hundred Film Corporation", "creator_id": 36305, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036043", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111663, "name": "Cowboy Booking International", "creator_id": 36306, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143584", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111665, "name": "Gravity Hill Films", "creator_id": 36307, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222536", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111666, "name": "Pumpernickel", "creator_id": 36308, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091406", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2111657, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52255", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33862]}, {"id": 96763, "acmi_id": "504758", "title": "Bending and reflecting sunlight", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bending-and-reflecting-sunlight", "creator_credit": "Warren Brown and Encyclopaedia Britannica Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Three boys, experimenting with everyday objects, discover the phenomena of refraction and reflection.

Filmed in Ireland, Canada, the United States and Italy, Part 1 contrasts the experiences of contemporary active nuns, living and working amidst poverty and crime, with the story of a young woman whose search for spirituality led her to a monastery near Rome. The film explores some of the roots of the paternalistic attitudes that have dominated the Catholic Church almost since its inception and the resultant denigration and sometimes persecution of religious women. Part 1 ends with contemporary nuns voicing their feelings about love and sexuality.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nuns", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2111565, "name": "Margaret Wescott", "creator_id": 74615, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091132", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111564, "name": "Kathleen Shannon", "creator_id": 74177, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16014183", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111561, "name": "Signe Johansson", "creator_id": 76285, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298910", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111559, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1530721", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2111555, "name": "Educational Media Australia", "creator_id": 11964, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34243", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [17937]}, {"id": 65336, "acmi_id": "320115", "title": "Behind the switch", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "behind-the-switch", "creator_credit": "Neil Howe, Shan Benson and State Electricity Commission of Victoria", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Every switch is a demand for instant electricity.

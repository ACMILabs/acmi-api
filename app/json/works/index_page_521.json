(3)&#8221;Looking for Langston&#8221; (1989) is dedicated to the black artists of the Harlem Renaissance. Writers such as Langston Hughes and James Baldwin not only celebrated the African-American history suppressed by white society but also liberated black homosexual desire. &#8220;Looking for Langston&#8221; is a beautiful and erotic essay on black men&#8217;s love for each other and the difficulty of negotiating gay love in a racist culture.

Mangrove bushes grow with amazing rapidity providing shelter to sea-birds, and assisting in the formation of marine life such as crabs, lobsters, and shell fish, all of which play their part in stabilising the growing islet. Rain helps reduce the salty content of the substratum until it is able to support other forms of plant life besides mangroves. Eventually insects and reptiles are soon represented and the ecological history of the island is complete.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:24:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Marine ecology", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Florida", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environment", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Island ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mangrove", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Marine ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Marsh ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Marine ecology", "Places&nbsp;→ Florida", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2402657, "name": "Maurice Groen", "creator_id": 30406, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2402656, "name": "DPM Productions", "creator_id": 30405, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45194", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1954", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1954"}], "labels": [27762]}, {"id": 65454, "acmi_id": "320230", "title": "Birth of a car", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "birth-of-a-car", "creator_credit": "Roland Litchfield and Litchfield Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1946", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1946-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The manufacture of the first Australian designed car, the Holden.

It is 1954, the French are still involved in Vietnam, the hardships of the war years are in the past, and for Laurent, who is endlessly pampered by his adoring mother (Lea Massari) and two oldest brothers, life is very sweet indeed. Louis Malle&#8217;s &#8220;Le Souffle au Coeur&#8221; is a surprisingly acerbic comedy about the privileges and causal amoralities of the middle class. The surprise is in how tender Malle is towards the sexual and physical experiences of adolescence. Masturbation, virginity, initiation to prostitution, incestuous feelings; all are treated with a gentle mockery that strips them of fetishism or gross perversity. In fact, it is selfishness of wealth that is the real perversity in this intoxicating film. When young Laurent finally gives expression to his sexual desire for his beautiful girlish mother, we are treated to one of the few moments in cinema history where incest is treated not with terror or with guilt but as part of the animal instincts of the human animal. Undoubtedly, Malle&#8217;s intention was to focus on the social and economic conditions that gave rise to the massive bourgeois protests of the late 1960s, however he refuses to make his wicked family monstrous or to scapegoat them entirely for the faults of their class. Laurent, his brothers and his parents are oblivious to any of the darkness that exists in the world around them. &#8220;Le Souffle au Coeur&#8221; which could be subtitled &#8220;Memoirs of a Catholic Childhood&#8221; is one of the most refreshingly secular films ever made.

Louis Malle&#8217;s &#8220;Le Souffle au Coeur&#8221; is a surprisingly acerbic comedy about the privileges and causal amoralities of the middle class. The surprise is in how tender Malle is towards the sexual and physical experiences of adolescence. Masturbation, virginity, initiation to prostitution, incestuous feelings; all are treated with a gentle mockery that strips them of fetishism or gross perversity. In fact, it is selfishness of wealth that is the real perversity in this intoxicating film. When young Laurent finally gives expression to his sexual desire for his beautiful girlish mother, we are treated to one of the few moments in cinema history where incest is treated not with terror or with guilt but as part of the animal instincts of the human animal. Undoubtedly, Malle&#8217;s intention was to focus on the social and economic conditions that gave rise to the massive bourgeois protests of the late 1960s, however he refuses to make his wicked family monstrous or to scapegoat them entirely for the faults of their class. Laurent, his brothers and his parents are oblivious to any of the darkness that exists in the world around them. &#8220;Le Souffle au Coeur&#8221; which could be subtitled &#8220;Memoirs of a Catholic Childhood&#8221; is one of the most refreshingly secular films ever made.

However, no matter how hard they try, no matter how much love they offer Solange, they are unable to bring a smile to her face or make her fall pregnant (which they believe is all that she really needs). A trip away to a summer camp leads to Solange meeting the precocious Christian, a thirteen year old boy with the IQ of a genius. At first, she attempts to mother the boy, but finds herself slowly seduced by him, and Stephan and Raoul can only stand-by and watch as the teenager gives Solange everything they cannot. This wickedly sly comedy about marriage, sexual mores, and the differences between men and women won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 1978. Though definitely absurdist in its sensibility, &#8220;Get Out Your Handkerchiefs&#8221; refuses to treat its characters cynically or cruelly. Rather, it is as if in examining the fall-out of the sexual revolution, Blier&#8217;s response is to throw up his arms, laugh at the madness of it all, and finally to celebrate the madness of the battle of the sexes.

Once roles are assigned, uniforms are put on - militaristic ones for the guards and a simple numbered smock for the prisoners - and the rules for the experiment are made clear. Like a &#8216;Lord of The Flies&#8217; but for adults locked in a cage with similarly shocking results - after only three days things go awry and the corruptible nature of power in the human psyche asserts itself. Dark and industrial setting with hard-rock sound track (&#8216;Linkin Park&#8217; are featured) add to the oppressive and harsh environment in which the story takes place. Cast includes Maren Eggert, Christian Bekel, Justus Von Dohnany and Oliver Stokowski. Bleibtreu won Best Actor for this role at two film festivals.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Journalists", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Imprisonment", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison violence", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Human rights", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Research", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Change (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Power (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychological tests", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology - Experiments", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Role playing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ German literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2347481, "name": "Oliver Hirschbiegel", "creator_id": 53183, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q60634", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347479, "name": "Fritz Wildfeuer", "creator_id": 81164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036826", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347477, "name": "Marc Conrad", "creator_id": 81163, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q17352735", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347473, "name": "Norbert Preuss", "creator_id": 81162, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q90826780", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347468, "name": "Fanes Film", "creator_id": 37217, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q78625928", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347471, "name": "Senator Film Production", "creator_id": 34075, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q29390930", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347464, "name": "Typhoon Pictures", "creator_id": 37216, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337038", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2347461, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53135", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34579]}]}

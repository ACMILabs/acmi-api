After introducing the First Amendment, three enacted sequences are presented: in the first, students in a classroom argue about the government&#8217;s foreign policies; in the second, the teacher forcefully leads the discussion, raising the question of academic freedom and the wishes of parents; the third sequence deals with an anti-war demonstration in which a threatening crowd forms, which questions the duty of the police. The film presents conflicting opinions and controversial scenes. It&#8217;s purpose: to let you find out what you think. Footage includes demonstrations for civil rights, women&#8217;s rights, African-American protest, KKK meetings.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:21:30:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police discretion", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Democracy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Forums (Discussion and debate)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Freedom of association", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Freedom of speech", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Constitution - Amendments - 1st-10th", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Foreign relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Politics and government", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Forums (Discussion and debate)", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "History&nbsp;→ United States - Constitution - Amendments - 1st-10th", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 858736, "name": "Churchill Films", "creator_id": 11924, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "28802", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [12574], "external_references": []}, {"id": 97637, "acmi_id": "506666", "title": "Speech and language disorders", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "speech-and-language-disorders", "creator_credit": "Queensland.

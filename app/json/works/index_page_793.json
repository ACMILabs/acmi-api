Deliberately provocative, and seeking to shock, this film revels in its low-budget amateurism and artlessness. Aesthetically it shares much in common with &#8220;Flesh for Frankenstein&#8221; and &#8220;Rocky Horror Picture Show&#8221; but has no hope of achieving the cult status of these enduring films, principally because its relentlessly over-the-top mood and delivery rob it of any impact as comedy or as horror. The unremitting black humour, shoddy sets, trashy costuming, bad taste themes and poor acting, make &#8220;Pandemonium&#8221; a curio of Australian filmmaking. Cast includes David Argue, Amanda Dole, Esben Storm, Ian Nimmo, Gary Foley, Haydn Keenan, Ignatius Jones, Lex Marinos.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fascism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2186625, "name": "Haydn Keenan", "creator_id": 21647, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5686458", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2186613, "name": "KFM Pandemonium", "creator_id": 36090, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035060", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2186618, "name": "Smart Street Films", "creator_id": 22349, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357849", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2186620, "name": "Tra La La Films", "creator_id": 23230, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126892", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2186609, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52062", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [33695]}, {"id": 93038, "acmi_id": "316398", "title": "Living with happiness", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "living-with-happiness", "creator_credit": "Sarah Watt and Sarah Watt Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A young mother finds herself gripped by an overwhelming pessimism that threatens to consume her.

Based on the biography of Orton by John Lahr (played in the film by Wallace Shawn), &#8220;Prick Up Your Ears&#8221; is a confronting and unsentimental examination of the tormented love relationship between Orton and his less successful, less charismatic lover, Kenneth Halliwell (played by Alfred Molina). The attractive and witty Orton uses his art and his life to confront the bourgeois class values of the English theatrical establishment, as well as mocking their hypocritical conservative sexual morality. His commitment to sexual promiscuity, as well as the meteoric nature of his success, enrages the shy Halliwell who can only respond with paranoid and violent behaviour.

It wasn’t that Konami knew what a phenomenon The Simpsons would become, it’s that they already had the blueprints for the game. Two years earlier they’d developed the successful Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles arcade game and applied the same mechanics to The Simpsons, which featured almost identical play style and two-button combat.</p>\n<p>What set The Simpsons apart was the accurate voice renditions of everyone’s favourite Springfield residents, with the TV show’s main cast voicing the characters in the game. Players control either Homer, Marge, Bart or Lisa as they use unique fighting techniques – punching, swinging a vacuum cleaner, skateboard or skipping rope – to rescue Maggie after she’s kidnapped by Smithers. Unfortunately, Lee Carvallo isn’t in the game so you can’t swing a three-wood golf club.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Games Lab&nbsp;→ GL-02.

Lugosi&#8217;s portrayal of the suave but deadly Count in this film, based on a play adaptation of Stoker&#8217;s novel, was so memorable that it influenced countless imitations, and brought the former stage actor to great prominence. The film opens with English real estate agent, Renfield (Dwight Frye), travelling to Transylvania to the remote castle of Count Dracula to close a deal on the rental of a London property. Succumbing to the Count&#8217;s sinister spell, Renfield returns to England on a ship loaded with coffins, where his deranged ramblings promptly cause him to be institutionalised. Dracula (Lugosi), meanwhile, sets up residence in his new home, Carfax Abbey, and begins prowling the misty night streets of London for new victims. Attempting to insinuate himself into high society, he attends the opera, where he meets Dr. Seward, the owner of the institution housing Renfield, who introduces him to his daughter, Mina, her fiance Jonathon, and Mina&#8217;s friend Lucy. Lucy quickly falls under Dracula&#8217;s dark spell, and becomes a vampire, preying on small children. Dr. Seward, alarmed by the number of victims exhibiting similar marks on their necks, calls in Professer Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who voices his suspicions of vampirism.

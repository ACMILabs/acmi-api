Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program&#8217;s style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture.

The works explore the fluid line between the abstract and figurative and use process both as a means and an end.

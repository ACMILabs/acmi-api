He is totally committed to the ideal of execution equipment that runs flawlessly and efficiently, that kills its victim in the most swift and painless manner. The detail and passion with which Leuchter describes the workings of electric chairs or lethal injection is jaw dropping, and reveals an individual with an extremely perverse, skewed perspective on things. His categorical oddness is revealed merely by the fact that he drinks forty cups of coffee and smokes six packs of cigarettes in one day. Leuchter&#8217;s extreme naivety finds its ultimate expression in his work for the Revisionist Historians which involves trespassing onto Auschwitz, surreptitiously removing samples from the &#8216;alleged&#8217; gas chambers, testing them to find they bare no chemical residue that would substantiate the Holocaust, and therefore declaring the Holocaust a myth. Morris reveals via interviews and documentary footage how the neo-Nazis used this eccentric somewhat disturbed &#8216;geek&#8217; for their own purposes.

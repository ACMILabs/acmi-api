Hannah still has a quick tongue and will do anything to avoid the &#8216;psychobabble&#8217; inflicted on her by people who attempt to understand her. Throughout the weekend they meet people who remind them of the events that have shaped their lives, awakening them to the realisation of where they&#8217;ve come from, and where they are headed.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Simon Channing-Williams ; director, writer, Mike Leigh ; photography, Dick Pope ; music, Marianne Jean-Baptiste ; editing Robin Sales.<br />\nCast: Katrin Cartlidge, Lynda Steadman, Mark Benton, Kate Byers, Andy Serkis.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816624, "name": "Simon Channing-Williams", "creator_id": 26252, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2606507", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889582, "name": "Channel Four Television", "creator_id": 25260, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889583, "name": "Thin Man Films", "creator_id": 32186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889584, "name": "Matrix Films", "creator_id": 32187, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889586, "name": "Mike Leigh", "creator_id": 21151, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q315756", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146379", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [55228]}, {"id": 115733, "acmi_id": "F000091", "title": "The End of violence", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-end-of-violence", "creator_credit": "Wim Wenders, Nicholas Klein, Deepak Nayar, Kintop Pictures, Road Movies Filmproduktion and CiBy 2000", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A film about conspiracy, the effects of violence in our culture, and personal transformation.

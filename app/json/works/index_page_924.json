The documentary explores each woman&#8217;s emotional and spiritual attachment to the town, to their surrounding environment and their kinship with the people of Broome and with each other. Evocative and beautifully photographed by Veronica Iacono, and sensitively scripted and directed by Lucinda Gamble, &#8220;The Nature of paradise&#8221; is stunningly rich in images and colour, of reds and blues, of the earth, sky and the ocean and is accompanied by an ambient musical soundtrack, &#8220;Free diving&#8221; written and performed by Lorrei<br />\nCoffin. Interspersed throughout the documentary are images of both Trish and Monique&#8217;s paintings which reflect their transitional journey to this place called &#8220;paradise&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:20:58:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Western Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Broome (W.A.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Western Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Western Australia - Description and travel", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Rural women", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Places&nbsp;→ Broome (W.A.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Places&nbsp;→ Western Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 730098, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 730097, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 730096, "name": "Victorian College of the Arts, School of Film and Television", "creator_id": 9066, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2322", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [48486]}, {"id": 70777, "acmi_id": "007479", "title": "The Nature of Light", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-nature-of-light", "creator_credit": "David A.

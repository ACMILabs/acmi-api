Amongst this quirky cast of characters (the likes of which were a characteristic element of Australian features of the early nineties including Parker and Tass&#8217; earlier work), they meet a young drop-out musician who finds a way to connect with Amy through music, allowing her to regain her voice through song. Despite a strong cast, the film suffers from an attempt to embrace a range of genres and styles including slapstick comedy, musical, family melodrama and gritty realism. Cast includes Alana De Roma, Rachel Griffiths, Ben Mendelsohn, Nick Barker and Kerry Armstrong.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and death", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Deafness", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief - Psychological aspects"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 914064, "name": "Nadia Tass", "creator_id": 64484, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q532307", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914063, "name": "David Parker", "creator_id": 58656, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5238384", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914062, "name": "Nadia Tass", "creator_id": 64484, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q532307", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914060, "name": "Cascade Films", "creator_id": 64483, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914061, "name": "Film Victoria", "creator_id": 68720, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 914059, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51263", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33138]}, {"id": 93634, "acmi_id": "317155", "title": "The League of gentlemen", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-league-of-gentlemen", "creator_credit": "Basil Dearden, Michael Relph and Allied Filmmakers", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1960", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 43720, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q735381"}], "brief_description": "<p>A disgruntled army colonel who has been forcibly retired decides to take revenge on England by executing a daring daylight bank robbery.

A charming, gentle, compassionate man, Arthur Boyd was born in 1920 in Murrumbeena, Melbourne, into a family of artists - a family who was known for its eccentricities and stern religious background. In this film we see Arthur chatting with his two young grandsons, providing them with a historical glimpse into their family background through old photographs and stories which have been passed down through the generations, along with his own personal memories of growing up in such a dynasty of &#8220;painters, potters, and dreamers&#8221;. Boyd was a figurative artist whose work focused on the human condition within the Australian landscape and although he did spend many years out of Australia in London and Europe, his works always retained the Australian spirit. Through stills, home movies, interviews, personal narratives and examples of his paintings, this program endeavours to give an overview of Boyd&#8217;s evolving journey through the decades, from his early aspirations to being an actor to finally becoming a serious painter and sculptor. We also see Boyd at work in 1993 as he prepares for a retrospective Exhibition to be held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Arthur Boyd has left his legacy to the Australian people by bequeathing three of his properties as a gift to the nation, including the well-known &#8220;Bundanon&#8221; property which houses artists in residence, an education centre and several of Boyd&#8217;s paintings. Arthur Boyd died on 24 April 1999. This superb documentary is a testimony to a truly great artist.

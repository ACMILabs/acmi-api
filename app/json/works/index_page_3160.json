This documentary interviews a Murray River farmer, attempts to explain why the situation has occurred, and searches for a solution for the future.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Agriculture", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Agriculture - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Agriculture - Environmental aspects", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Irrigation - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Irrigation farming - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Salinity - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Soil erosion", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Soil erosion - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Water in agriculture", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Murray River (N.S.W.-S.

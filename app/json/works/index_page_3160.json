Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program.

There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically.

Modern gambling relies on the gambler&#8217;s willingness to take a chance. Ep. 1. Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program. Gambling it seems has no limit to a person&#8217;s behaviour and just how far they are willing to go - some even to the point of death. Mark &#8220;Chopper&#8221; Read talks of his &#8220;rush&#8221; when he plays Russian Roulette, others get their excitement from betting on &#8220;dares&#8221; and playing weird games for money. There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically.

The film illustrates the School&#8217;s emphasis on &#8220;Habits of Mind&#8221; (weighing evidence; awareness of multiple points of view; seeing connections and relationships; speculating on possibilities; and assessing values). Sequences illustrating the School&#8217;s approach to learning include: classroom activities in the humanities and sciences; family conferences; discussions of race, class, and gender; faculty meetings; disciplinary problems; sex education; conflict resolution by students; and student council meetings. The film shows the students learning how to learn, how to reason and how to critique complex issues requiring collaboration, personal responsibility and a tolerance for uncertainty.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Cinema verite", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Alternative schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - Study and teaching", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education, Higher", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students - Attitudes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884412, "name": "Zipporah Films", "creator_id": 36103, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884413, "name": "Frederick Wiseman", "creator_id": 80693, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52691", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [34171]}, {"id": 96405, "acmi_id": "503855", "title": "High school geography: new insights", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "high-school-geography-new-insights", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This is a training film to show teachers how to use some parts of the High Schools Geography Project, particularly the &#8220;Geography in an urban age&#8221; unit.

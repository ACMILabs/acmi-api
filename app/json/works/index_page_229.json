they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film captures a major event in the lives of the Nixon family – daughter Karen’s wedding. The fashion on the day is a wonderful example of the late 1980s and the bridesmaids wear Karen’s favourite colour, red. Karen’s new family, the Corrys, are in the film having visited from the UK.</p>\n<p>Of interest in this film, when Karen arrives at the church there are many onlookers who are there but are not guests.

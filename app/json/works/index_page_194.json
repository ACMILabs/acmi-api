El Cid was nominated for three Academy Awards - Art Direction, Best Song and Best Musical Score - and picked up a Golden Globe award in 1962 for producer Samuel Bronston. Stars Raf Vallone as Count Ordonez, Ralph Truman as King Ferdinand, Genevieve Page as Princess Urraca, John Fraser as Prince Alfonso, Gary Raymond as Prince Sancho, and Herbert Lom as Ben Yusef, with a sweeping musical score by Milkos Rosza.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Spain", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and state", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "History&nbsp;→ Spain - History - 711-1516", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Places&nbsp;→ Spain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1974627, "name": "Anthony Mann", "creator_id": 11238, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q269975", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1974626, "name": "Samuel Bronston", "creator_id": 26638, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q706968", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1974625, "name": "DEAR Film", "creator_id": 24553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1974631, "name": "Michael Hordern", "creator_id": 80150, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1974630, "name": "Frank Thring", "creator_id": 75229, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1974629, "name": "Sophia Loren", "creator_id": 80149, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1974628, "name": "Charlton Heston", "creator_id": 80148, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1974624, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50665", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [32639], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93135, "acmi_id": "316512", "title": "The Cider House rules", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-cider-house-rules", "creator_credit": "Lasse Hallstrom, Richard Gladstein, Miramax Films and Film Colony", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>John Irving won an Academy Award for his script to the film which is based on his acclaimed novel of the same name.

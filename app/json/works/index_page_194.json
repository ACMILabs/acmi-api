Publicly humiliated during Tara&#8217;s nuptial celebrations, a vengeful Maya seduces the king prior to his wedding night. Consequently Maya is spurned and turned out into the street, despite the king&#8217;s burgeoning obsession for her.

Meanwhile the king has fallen into an opium addled, hedonistic stupor that threatens the future of the kingdom.

Living in New York, Theremin was celebrated for his invention before being kidnapped in the 1930s by Russian secret service agents. A Russian by birth, Theremin was tried for treason, and sent to a gulag or labour camp in Siberia. At the outset of World War II, Theremin&#8217;s talents became valuable to the Russians as an originator of surveillance devices - he went on to create the first &#8216;bug&#8217;, winning the Stalin Prize. The theremin, which predated the synthesiser in terms of electronic sound, can be heard on the Beach Boys classic &#8220;Good vibrations&#8221; and was also utilised in the soundtracks of &#8220;Spellbound&#8221; and &#8220;The Day the earth stood still&#8221;.

Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold) is a sensitive young poet who naively decides to leave the safety of Oslo and his girlfriend Gertrude (Camilla Martens) to embark on a fur-trapping expedition to Greenland for twelve months. It is the year 1925. On arrival at the east coast of Greenland, Henrik is teamed up with two experienced trappers, the rough and intimidating Randbek (Stellan Skarsgard) and the quieter introspective scientist, Holm (Bjorn Sundquist). Their living quarters for the twelve months is a tiny isolated hut in the bleak icy sparseness of the Greenland wastelands where tension and conflict between the three escalates to unimaginable heights, and man&#8217;s inhumanity to man emerges as more than just a threat. This is an outstanding film by Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland (The Last lieutenant) full of atmosphere and ambience and a stark beauty which underlies the ugliness and volatility smouldering beneath the surface. Stellan Skarsgard (The Unbearable lightness of being, The Hunt for Red October, Breaking the Waves, Simple minded murderer) and Gard B.

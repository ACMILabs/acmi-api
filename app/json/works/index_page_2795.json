Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton are excellent as two young lovers working out their shared dependency on each other and on heroin, and they are well supported by a supporting cast that includes Holly Hunter, Denis Leary and Dennis Hopper. Though the material is harsh and confronting, &#8220;Jesus&#8217; Son&#8221; also emerges as a deeply optimistic and humane drama. This is an excellent example of a film work that remains true to the mood and emotional intensity of its original source text, but which also creatively re-imagines and develops the story for another medium.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Heroin habit", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jesus-son", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961271, "name": "Alliance Atlantis", "creator_id": 30788, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961272, "name": "Blue Sky Studios", "creator_id": 34323, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961273, "name": "Evenstar", "creator_id": 34324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961274, "name": "Elizabeth Cutherell", "creator_id": 79985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961275, "name": "Lydia Dean Pilcher", "creator_id": 29543, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961276, "name": "David Urrutial", "creator_id": 79986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961277, "name": "Margot Bridger", "creator_id": 79987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961278, "name": "Alison MacLean", "creator_id": 7932, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961270, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50301", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32283], "external_references": [{"id": 4558, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "25636"}]}, {"id": 79327, "acmi_id": "300266", "title": "Jessye Norman: Singer", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jessye-norman-singer", "creator_credit": "Arts Council of Great Britain, BBC-TV, Harvey Kass and Cathy Palmer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1986", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The full range and diversity of Jessye Norman&#8217;s singing is captured on film at performances in London, Paris and New York.

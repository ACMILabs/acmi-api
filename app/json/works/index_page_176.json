Mehri, who shares Haji&#8217;s passion for photography, tries in her own way to assist Haji in his recovery surrounding him with positive images of life whilst also pushing for their wedding ceremony to take place against her family&#8217;s wishes who now want to cancel the marriage.

Haji&#8217;s boss, however, is not interested in social issues and refuses to print the photos leading to a tragic sequence of events for Haji and Mehri, and Haji&#8217;s eventual breakdown. Using evocative sounds and images, Makhmalbaf (Kandahar, Gabbeh) has created an amazing piece of experimental and controversial filmmaking in &#8220;The Marriage of the blessed&#8221; which for all its political and social commentary, managed to escape the religious censorship by the Iranian regime of the time.

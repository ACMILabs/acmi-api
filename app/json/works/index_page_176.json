Features two songs from Madonna on the soundtrack and cast includes Illeana Douglas and Lynn Redgrave.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Comedy", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Custody of children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1975457, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55303", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975456, "name": "Linne Radmin", "creator_id": 80343, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975455, "name": "Leslie Dixon", "creator_id": 80342, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q516252", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975454, "name": "Tom Rosenberg", "creator_id": 79394, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7817415", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975453, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975452, "name": "Lakeshore Entertainment", "creator_id": 31676, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51125", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33057], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93553, "acmi_id": "317008", "title": "Talk 16", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "talk-16", "creator_credit": "Adrienne Mitchell, Janis Lundman, National Film Board of Canada and Back Alley Film Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This is a most compelling and entertaining documentary about the personal lives of five young teenage girls aged between 15 and 16.

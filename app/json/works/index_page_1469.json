A sergeant in the British army, Cutter is a restless treasure-seeker likely to get everyone into trouble; MacChesney is a typically gruff and aggressive NCO always ready for a fight; and Ballantine is a gentleman who thinks he wants to leave the army to marry his one true love. Gunga Din is an Indian water carrier, a friend in need to the trouble-making trio - a simple man who is destined to become a hero. Based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling the film stars Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Joan Fontaine.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/gunga-din", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1985236, "name": "George Stevens", "creator_id": 22751, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51490", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1985235, "name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "creator_id": 71465, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1985234, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37027", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [20669], "external_references": [{"id": 23914, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q760012"}]}]}

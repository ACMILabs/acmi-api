The comparisons don&#8217;t end there however, as both directors also share a taste for sly black humour which Argento displays through the array of oddball characters that populate the film, including a demented artist who eats cats and a pimp with a neurotic streak. Cast also includes Suzy Kendall, Enrico Maria Salerno, Eva Renzi, Reggie Nalder and Mario Adorf.

be the Mallee stump. The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling. It always has been. And yeah, always will be.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Because we didn&#8217;t have any social club rooms at the time to store any of our memorabilia, everything was stored at the pub. And as different publicans come and go, some don&#8217;t like the memorabilia that apparently collects dust, and so he decided he&#8217;d clean the place out. And I went past one day and he was heading out to the tip with all of this football memorabilia in the back of his Ute.</p>\n<p>And so I quickly went in and grabbed the lot. And I&#8217;ve still got a fair bit of it, but it&#8217;s all there for the football club, for the future. And it&#8217;s interesting how some people just don&#8217;t value these things that others really think are fairly precious.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I just think, mainly because of where we live, in the middle of the Mallee, it was called the Mallee Footy League, and we end up with a trophy made out of a Mallee stump, you can&#8217;t get much more significant than that.

We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo. And the rest was history, I suppose.</p>\n<p>[FANS CHEERING]</p>\n<p>[OTHER SIDE BOOING]</p>\n<p>And then if you thought that was erupting over there, well, the display when I was over other side of game was something to behold.

Over four years that I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve just decided that I love it, and I love football, and that&#8217;s why I stayed.</p>\n<p>-When I first walked into the umpire fraternity, the track supervisor at the stage, he firstly said, come on, young fellow, here&#8217;s the ball. Took me over to the point pace, and he said, showed me the basics of hanging on and holding the ball. And he said, now, I want you to bounce this ball up and down at this point pace. It&#8217;s gotta be straight up and down it, and it&#8217;s also got to reach the top of it.</p>\n<p>So for two weeks or so I practiced and I practiced. After a couple of weeks, I, yeah, I mastered it. And so I went over to the track supervisor Roy. And I said, Roy, I&#8217;ve done it, where do I go next?</p>\n<p>He says, no son, come here. We&#8217;ve moved to the goal post now. And I said, what? And he said, now I want you to do it up and down the goal post and to the height of the goal post.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a skill, and we&#8217;ve lost it in the country because we throw the ball up. But for the young fellas, my mentees, it&#8217;s a case that will be taught, and I hope to pass that skill onto them.</p>\n<p>-Well, I&#8217;ll have to learn how to bounce it one day for I want to go to the AFL, which I do. It&#8217;d be a dream one day walking around the MCG with all the 100,000 people roaring. But yeah, I&#8217;ll just let it take me and enjoy the ride, I reckon.</p>\n<p>-It&#8217;s put another spring in my step doing this mentoring program, because these young fellas, I can see that possibility that I&#8217;d hope one will make it to AFL.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>-Basically, he works with me and pass on his knowledge of how to umpire and how to treat players, which is a fundamental aspect of being an umpire. I&#8217;m nervous every single game just because the fellas there, they&#8217;re another foot taller than me and just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a lot of expectations of me to perform.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>I just do it because I love it, and it&#8217;s a great game.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

In 1996 was when we affiliated with the Omeo and District Football League. We ‘ad the Seniors an’ the Juniors, we ‘ad the Junior Netball all the way through to the Senior Netball for the girls, we drafted quite a few players from other Clubs around the East Gippie an’ the Omeo League as well…there were Kooris playing in but they wished to play for Lake Tyers. I coached the Juniors in ’96 to the Grand Final. The following year I coached the Seniors to the Grand Final as well. The moral of Lake Tyers lifted through sport, kids were attending school on a regular basis, the health issues at Lake Tyers lifted an’ the Elders had somewhere to go on Saturdays where they could sit there an’ watch the boys and girls play Netball an’ Football. During those two years some of our issues were some of the players we drafted from other areas became angry on the ground. It sort of sounded like as if they wanted to be black versus white. During my coaching of those years I tried to talk to players not to be like that, that it wasn’t a racial issue. The other thing was, there was only probably four to six people running a Football Club, which wasn’t enough numbers to run a Football Club.</p>\n<p>Got time…got time…Pass…pass…pass…play on…go…go…go…</p>\n<p>When we were asked to leave the Omeo League, the moral of Lake Tyers went backwards. It’s pretty sad, you know when I get up in the morning, or go to work, you know, you see these young players that were playing footy in…some of the Senior players that haven’t played now for five or six years, I mean, they’re walking around with their heads down…um…they’re finding it hard to get out and play Football with other Clubs at the present time. Our kids become bored…there’s nothing to do for ‘em out at Lake Tyers at the moment, so certainly vandalism comes into it…you know, when kids don’t have nothing more to do than break windows or throw stones at street lights.

Archival video reproduced courtesy of Hampden FNL, Swifts Creek FC and Dawn Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT:  I got to meet Fizz through junior football. Fizz used to cart me around everywhere and play footy. And then one thing led to another and I developed into seniors, and Fizz was a senior umpire in the North Central League. And so Fizz umpired quite a few games when I was a young fellow playing.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t actually get to see Fizz play. But if you listen to the storytellers around Wedderburn, they say Fizz didn&#8217;t mind dishing a little bit out, being a rover and being small, got that small man syndrome.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  Yeah, I was a very fiery player. I was very tough and very fiery. But when I give it up, I thought, I went back and I just changed the attitude all over. And I thought, well, I&#8217;ve got to be a lot different from what I was as a player.</p>\n<p>I started in 1974, 28 years of umpiring. I umpired 560 games, and I&#8217;ve done at least 20 Grand Finals.</p>\n<p>[MAN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done all those games without any reports. I&#8217;ve sent people off and I&#8217;ve warned people. I&#8217;d rather give them a 50-meter or talk to them than things like that. Because I thought that was a lot easier. Because well, I got more respect by doing that than reporting.

PITMAN:  I do have vivid memories of the 1959 Grand Final. I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened.

But it just failed to go.</p>\n<p>After 35 minutes, cars were leaving the ground in droves and we were four goals in front. And I blame ourselves, up to a point. I think we sort of relaxed, thinking the game was won.</p>\n<p>And one bloke by the name of Gordon Byron drove into Wangaratta, through he&#8217;d switch on the wireless and see what the final score was.

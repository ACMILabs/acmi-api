It appears that 6 couples married by the celebrant were not legal as he began practicing before his legal appointment. Thus, the couples are given a second chance at deciding whether or not they&#8217;re happy with the partner they&#8217;ve chosen and their life together so far. Couples contemplating their future include the unhappy radio performers (Ginger Rogers and Fred Allen), an aspiring Mrs America and her house husband (Marilyn Monroe and David Wayne), a philanderer and his wife who have run out of things to say (Eve Arden and Paul Douglas), a gold digger already beginning divorce proceedings (Zsa Zsa Gabor and Louis Calhern), and a soldier and his pregnant wife desperate to make their first born child legitimate (Mitzi Gaynor and Eddie Bracken). The 6th couple have already divorced.

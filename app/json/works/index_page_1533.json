Whilst competing in the revived National Skateboarder Championships, the tricks performed wowed those present and the Z-Boys ruled. This documentary uses extensive stills and footage from the era (some of it quite astounding) and intersperses it with contemporary interviews with the Z-boys, who reminisce about their glory days and the forces that shaped their destiny. MTV style editing, a plenitude of vintage material and a rocking soundtrack (including Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, Led Zepplin The Stooges and Jimi Hendrix) makes for great viewing.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ California", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Closed captioning", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fame", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fame", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Outdoor recreation", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Skateboarding", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surfboards", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surfing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Youth - Recreation", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ California"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/dogtown-and-z-boys", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999354, "name": "Stacy Peralta", "creator_id": 71697, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q465229", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999353, "name": "Agi Orsi", "creator_id": 36409, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999352, "name": "Vans Off The Wall", "creator_id": 36408, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999351, "name": "AOP", "creator_id": 36407, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999350, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

Effectively utilising the confines of the barrack as an incendiary setting for pent up frustrations, Wilder successfully explores the mob mentality in a compelling manner; less compelling (at least dramatically) are the humorous moments operating as light relief which stagnate the drama, diluting the well crafted tension. &#8220;Stalag 17&#8221; was one of the first films to convey war with humour - a definite precursor to &#8220;M<em>A</em>S<em>H</em>&#8221;, &#8220;Catch-22&#8221; and the campy outlandishness of &#8220;Hogan&#8217;s Heroes&#8221;. William Holden won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the embittered Sefton - a role he apparently reluctantly played. Cast includes Don Taylor, Otto Preminger, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Peter Graves, Richard Erdman, Sig Rumann and Neville Brand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Slovenian", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers - United States", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Germany", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/stalag-17", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999334, "name": "Billy Wilder", "creator_id": 56081, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51547", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999333, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999332, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52331", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [33921], "external_references": []}]}

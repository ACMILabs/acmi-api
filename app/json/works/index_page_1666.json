Cast includes: David Hemblen, Aidan Tierney, Gabrielle Rose, Arsinee Khanjian, Selma Keklikian, Rose Sarkisyan.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Home movies and video", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/family-viewing", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1984831, "name": "Atom Egoyan", "creator_id": 22952, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q212167", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984830, "name": "Ontario Arts Council", "creator_id": 22119, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984829, "name": "Canada Council", "creator_id": 22118, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984828, "name": "Ontario Film Development Corporation", "creator_id": 63093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984827, "name": "Ego Film Arts", "creator_id": 22951, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36666", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [20326], "external_references": []}, {"id": 80834, "acmi_id": "324876", "title": "Marlene", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "marlene", "creator_credit": "Maximilian Schell and OKO-Filmproduktion", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1984", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Maximilian Schell has created a fascinating film, amusing and sad, imaginative and courageously put together.

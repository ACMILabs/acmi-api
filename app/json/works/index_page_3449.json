Purportedly the most expensive production to be shot in Europe, the film stars Jude Law, Bob Hoskins, Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes and Ed Harris.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Stalingrad, Battle of, Volgograd, Russia, 1942-1943", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Europe", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Propaganda", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Soviet Union", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961895, "name": "Mandalay Pictures", "creator_id": 8134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961896, "name": "Jean-Jacques Annaud", "creator_id": 21878, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961897, "name": "John Schofield", "creator_id": 80197, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961898, "name": "Jean-Jacques Annaud", "creator_id": 21878, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961894, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50767", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32730]}, {"id": 87739, "acmi_id": "309820", "title": "Enemy alien", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "enemy-alien", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Wolf Koenig and Jeanette Lerman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This is about a people who dared to ask: &#8220;What are they going to do with us?&#8221; The Japanese-Canadians fought long and hard to be accepted as Canadians.

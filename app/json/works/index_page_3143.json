With some truly wonderful set pieces, the animators of &#8220;Ice age&#8221; have created quite a magical netherworld where the dodo bird is depicted as too dim to ensure its survival into the next age and a persistent squirrel assiduously attempts to salvage a single acorn for a future feed. &#8220;Ice age&#8221; is very much family entertainment and should also prove interesting to those tracking the developments of computer animation. Humorously written, if at times a little twee, the film is a parable about friendship, acceptance and banding together. Featuring the voices of John Leguizamo, Ray Romano, Denis Leary, Jack Black and Jane Krakowski.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Prehistoric life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Human evolution"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 475}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 816901, "name": "Chris Wedge", "creator_id": 35566, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q185655", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816619, "name": "Lori Forte", "creator_id": 35565, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816899, "name": "Blue Sky Studios", "creator_id": 34323, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816898, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 816897, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51448", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33268]}, {"id": 70275, "acmi_id": "006908", "title": "The Meeting place", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-meeting-place-a", "creator_credit": "Catherine Duncan and Australian National Film Board", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1948", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1948-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The town of Nuriootpa - an aboriginal word meaning &#8220;the meeting place&#8221; - lies in the rich Barossa valley in South Australia, about fifty miles from Adelaide.

Arriving in New York in 1949 with his brother, the two took to New York and having bought a camera, started to document their new lives and all that unfurled around them. This work, &#8220;Three friends&#8221; is divided into two parts, &#8220;Zefrido Tonro&#8221; and &#8220;Happy birthday to John&#8221;. &#8220;Zefiro Tonrna&#8221; includes images of close friend George Maciunas from 1952, then proceeds to the 1970s, displaying Fluxus (an avant-garde art movement) events and performances and picnics with friends, including Yoko Ono, John Lennon and Andy Warhol. Narrated by Mekas (reading from his diary), who laments the physical demise of Maciunas whilst displaying the spiritedness of Mekas&#8217; involvement in New York&#8217;s art scene. &#8220;Happy birthday to John&#8221; On October 9th 1972, half of the music world gathered in Syracuse New York to celebrate the opening of John Lennon/Yoko Ono Fluxus show, designed by George Maciunas. The same day a smaller group gathered in a local hotel room to celebrate John&#8217;s birthday. Part two of &#8220;Three friends&#8221; is a record of this occasion, documenting the camaraderie of Lennon and Ono&#8217;s group of friends and associates. Soundtrack consists of singing by John, Yoko, Ringo Starr, Allen Ginsberg and Phil Oaks, among others.

Rearprojected onto a vast screen stretched like skin across the space, these human forms suggest early nineteenth-century museum exhibits: human specimens stripped of protective layers and preserved eternally in a captive vessel.</p>\n<p>Currently heading the Electronic Imaging Department at the University of Dundee, Gina Czarnecki works at the intersection of film, video and computer-generated imagery. In describing &#8216;Versifier&#8217; she explains, &#8216;I have always loved the cinematic experience and came to realise that I wanted this in an installation environment. There is something about being in the dark in a public space that focuses your eyes and attention onto small details, sounds, people in the space with you or your inner thoughts and solitude.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Once enclosed within Czarnecki&#8217;s installation, the viewer focuses on the exposed<br />\ninhabitants. With its confronting interface, Versifier challenges notions of modesty,<br />\ncandour, embarrassment, fascination. Experiences that we tend to take for granted are offered up for creepily clinical re-examination. Czarnecki has used digital technology to manipulate the figures into disquieting hybrid forms: skin tones are unusually monochromatic, limbs appear disproportionate and distended.

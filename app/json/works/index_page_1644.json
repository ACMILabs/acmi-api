Based on Bertolt Brecht&#8217;s play &#8216;Mother Courage and Her Children&#8217; the work reconstructs an immersive bushcamp environment within the gallery space, and explores the tensions between contemporary urban and traditional Indigenous lifestyles.</p>\n<p>“The installation comprises a white van housing a dual screen projection of an elderly Aboriginal woman artist and her grandson. Surrounded by paint pots, utensils and bedding, the woman (played by artist Grace Rubuntja) applies herself to her work, while the boy sits, bored, listening to loud Aboriginal rock music that blares out of a radio inside the van.<br />\n‘Mother Courage’ is inspired by Bertolt Brecht’s famous character Mother Courage. In Brecht’s 1939 play, ‘Mother Courage and her Children’, the title character, displaced by war, survives by moving and adapting to whatever life throws at her. In this way, she shares common ground with many Aboriginal people, particularly those Aboriginal women who, like Mother Courage, know what it is to lose children in a hostile world.<br />\nThornton’s ‘Mother Courage’ was first exhibited in 2012 at the prestigious contemporary art exhibition dOCUMENTA (13) held in Kassel, Germany. For the period of the exhibition, it was constantly on the move, ‘parked outside the most prestigious galleries in town, for art aficionados to peer in its grimy windows through its rear doors, to wonder at the business inside’. At ACMI, the work was reborn within the space of Gallery 2, no longer on the move, but cutting against the grain of the white cube/black box experience of the art gallery space.” [Source: ACMI Education resource kit]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social life and customs", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Urban residence", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Women", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Youth", "Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Multi-channel installation, video, monitor, van, mixed media props, paintings, colour and sound"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 91}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2659591, "name": "Warwick Thornton", "creator_id": 72838, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4461183", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659592, "name": "Scarlett Pictures", "creator_id": 72667, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "159063", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2012-2013", "notes": "Commission agreement 2012.

In the centre of each screen a performer enacts a basic spinning action over and over, each dancer representing a different language or subculture of movement.</p>\n<p>Gladwell further pushes this internal paradox with a shift in perspective from the original work, changing the camera viewpoint from a front-on to an aerial view. The black and white negative images are projected on to screens suspended in the ceiling of the gallery, appearing as spinning astral bodies – a sparkling universe of whirling figures. There is a clear connection here to the &#8220;Planet &amp; Stars Sequence&#8221; and to&#8221;‘Parallel Forces&#8221;. Are these bodies orbiting each other? Are they aware of their relationship to a wider planetary system? Are they stationary or are they turning on a still point?</p>\n<p>The performers are training rather than performing; their focus is on repetition and rotation of movements. There is Emma Magenta, a capoeira dancer, whose roughly circular movements recall her performance in &#8220;Woolloomooloo Night&#8221; (2004). Her movements are more muscular and less centred than the tight, graceful, fluid pirouettes of Vivienne Wong, ballerina with the Australian Ballet. Anthony Lawang, a break dancer from Melbourne, performs a series of floor-based manoeuvres, transitioning from a top rock position to a backspin and a windmill, climaxing in a tight backspin, disrupting any sense of how his body is oriented spatially. Simon O’Brien, a world champion freestyle BMX rider, performs a series of highly technical spins in which the bike frame and his body are linked and twisted by concentric forces. In contrast to these athletic routines, Kathryn Puie spins her body on stilts. In the overhead shot foreshortening her body, we see her body constantly shifting and shuffling in order to remain upright. Gladwell himself performs on a skateboard, spinning continuously. Contemporary dancer Lee Wilson uses his body as the pivot point for a whirling bread tray that flies above and around him. Michelle Shimmy and Maddie Schonstein, professional pole dancers, perform an improvised routine together on a pole, experimenting with movements and pushing their bodies into unrehearsed positions.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Centripetal Forces</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2011</p>", "description": "<p><i>Centripetal Forces</i> is an eight-channel video installation commissioned for the exhibition <i>Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences</i> in 2011.</p>\n<p><i>Centripetal Forces</i> is an elaboration of Gladwell&#8217;s interest in the dynamics and composition of the spinning figure, first seen in the single-channel <i>Pataphysical Man</i> (2005). <i>Centripetal Forces</i> takes the original image of the spinning figure and extends it into a series of comparative studies of gesture and movement by different performers.

During the late 1970s, the evolving structure of science and technology under the People&#8217;s Republic mostly thrived from the achievements of poorly educated civilians; hence this film significantly reflects the situation of the development of science and technology in China while the effects of Cultural Revolution slowly loosen its grip on their youngsters.</p>\n<p>My own afterthoughts:<br />\nThis is a wonderfully entertaining film which also hopes to showcase how the country continues to thrive in their development of science and technology, even though most civilian&#8217;s education and certification standards were not high.  I can&#8217;t help but also think the film also serves to boost national spirit while it shows young people full of vigor and vitality in the film.  Personally, there almost seems to be a subtextual reading which highlights to viewers that youngsters are the key to China&#8217;s future and the nation&#8217;s hopes are placed on them.  I would also like to add that the meaning of the Chinese title for this film is &#8216;Youngster&#8217; if translated directly into English.<br />\n(3 stars - Pearl Lau; November 13, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industries - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Transportation", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Urban transportation", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Transportation - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2659579, "name": "Luo Tai", "creator_id": 83950, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144057", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659578, "name": "Wang Jiayue", "creator_id": 83949, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659586, "name": "Zhou Hua", "creator_id": 83957, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271074", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659580, "name": "Lei Zulin", "creator_id": 83951, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337340", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659577, "name": "Changchun Film Studio", "creator_id": 34767, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5071736", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2659588, "name": "Chen Yixin", "creator_id": 83958, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298851", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659589, "name": "Chi Zhiqiang", "creator_id": 83959, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q9085126", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659590, "name": "Wang Qinbao", "creator_id": 83960, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222729", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659587, "name": "Wang Weiping", "creator_id": 82295, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078773", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659584, "name": "Wu Guoqiang", "creator_id": 83955, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143887", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659585, "name": "Lei Zhenbang", "creator_id": 83956, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659582, "name": "Sun Xiongfei", "creator_id": 83953, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659583, "name": "Wu Benfang", "creator_id": 83954, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659581, "name": "Zhou Yang", "creator_id": 83952, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

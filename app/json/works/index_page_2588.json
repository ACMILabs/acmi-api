The story is set on a Southern American Army Base in 1948 and is a complex web of sexual repression, military discipline and extra-marital affairs. Major Penderton (Marlon Brando) hides his homosexual tendencies behind strict discipline while his frustrated wife (Elizabeth Taylor) has an affair with a Lt. Colonel (Brian Keith). To make things more complicated the Lt. Colonel&#8217;s wife is also having an affair with her houseboy. Then there is Private Williams (Robert Foster) who likes naked horse riding. The repressed and obsessive Major Penderton has strong feelings of mixed jealousy when the young Private shows interest in his wife rather than him. This story of bad marriages and military life is both bleak and obsessive. The characters are living in a self imposed prison which they can not escape.

Her daughter has just left home on less than amicable terms and her married son is totally absorbed in his own life. When Mildred is approached by her neighbour (Marissa Tomei) to mind her young son, JJ, after her abusive husband walks out, she immediately consents. Initially quiet and tentative, JJ gradually gains confidence as the two develop a strong bond which provides them with the support they lack from their own families. The film explores the evolving relationship between Mildred and her two children, contrasting it to the unconditional friendship she shares with JJ.

Dustin Hoffman is Babe Levy, an impoverished history student living in the shadow of his father&#8217;s suicide. Daily, Babe tests himself running the streets of New York, but the ultimate test comes when his dubious brother (Roy Scheider) springboards the marathon man into an international conspiracy of diamonds, Nazis and double-crossings. Despite a stand-out performance by Laurence Olivier and some of the most well-known torture sequences in cinema history, &#8216;Marathon Man&#8217; is perhaps little more than a run-of-the-mill thriller. Accepted as such, it is nonetheless a satisfying one.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Espionage", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/le-coureur-de-marathon", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996148, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55303", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996147, "name": "Sidney Beckerman", "creator_id": 79067, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996146, "name": "Robert Evans", "creator_id": 68308, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996145, "name": "Connaught Productions", "creator_id": 34118, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49971", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1976", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1976"}], "labels": [31985], "external_references": []}]}

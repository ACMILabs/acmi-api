No noir film would be complete without the obligatory femme fatale, played with sultry poise by Kim Basinger who won an Oscar for her performance. Rather than it being mere pastiche, director Curtis Hanson treats the material in a direct, earnest fashion and in doing so delivers one of the best examples of the genre for some time. Cast also includes Danny DeVito, David Strathairn and James Cromwell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Los Angeles (Calif.)", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Los Angeles (Calif.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/l-a-confidential", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995992, "name": "Curtis Hanson", "creator_id": 69882, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q263486", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995991, "name": "Michael Nathanson", "creator_id": 79359, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995990, "name": "Curtis Hanson", "creator_id": 69882, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q263486", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995989, "name": "Arnon Milchan", "creator_id": 69886, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q697131", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995988, "name": "Regency Enterprises", "creator_id": 69843, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1995987, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49923", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [31943], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92443, "acmi_id": "315722", "title": "Abraham Valley = Vale Abraao", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "abraham-valley-vale-abraao", "creator_credit": "Manuel de Oliveira, Paolo Branco, Light Night Production, Gemini Films and Madragoa Filmes", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Portugal, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;Abraham Valley&#8217; is directed by Portuguese filmmaker, Manoel de Oliveira, who at 94, is a senior and prolific figure in contemporary world cinema.

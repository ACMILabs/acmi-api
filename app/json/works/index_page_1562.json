No noir film would be complete without the obligatory femme fatale, played with sultry poise by Kim Basinger who won an Oscar for her performance. Rather than it being mere pastiche, director Curtis Hanson treats the material in a direct, earnest fashion and in doing so delivers one of the best examples of the genre for some time.

Ray Winstone plays Carlin, an under-age offender sent from reform school to Borstal prison for assaulting a prison guard. In Borstal institutionalised violence is a way of life: the guards use it against the boys, the stronger boys against the younger boys. This is a bleak disturbing world of masculine aggression and hate, a racist world where black and white prisoners form separate &#8216;communities&#8217;, and where rape and physical coercion are accepted as currency. &#8216;Scum&#8217;, however, is not exploitative. The filmmakers&#8217; anger is firmly directed to the hypocritical and sanctimonious authorities which allow the prison system to function through brutality rather than through justice. By the end of the film, in which we have seen a young vulnerable boy kill himself rather than continue the endless cycle of brutalisation, we come to understand that the prison system as portrayed in this film damages everyone: prisoners, guards, and finally ourselves. The attempts to ban this stark social-realist work and the hysteria mounted against its representation of youth offenders speaks volumes about the unsettling truths it forces us to comprehend.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Male rape", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison violence", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth - Suicidal behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Male rape", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Suicidal behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Suicidal behavior"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 814008, "name": "Alan Clarke", "creator_id": 33527, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814007, "name": "Clive Parsons", "creator_id": 77372, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814006, "name": "David Belling", "creator_id": 80114, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814005, "name": "Boyd's Company", "creator_id": 61898, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814004, "name": "Berwick Street Films", "creator_id": 34708, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50571", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [32557]}, {"id": 72561, "acmi_id": "009526", "title": "Sculptured seal", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sculptured-seal", "creator_credit": "Frank Radd and Stanley Dalby", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1968", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Follows the work of Tom Bass on the 70-foot copper relief mural at the entrance of the National Library, Canberra, a symbolic complex embodying traditional images of learning and cultural heritage.

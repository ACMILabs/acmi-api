Moore, unbeknown to the book&#8217;s publishers, gathers a film crew to follow him as he gives public lectures, signs books and gives surprise visits to large corporations. Moore challenges some executives at large companies asking why they are &#8216;downsizing&#8217; staff in a time of record profits. He visits not only large cities but also some small towns - including one town that was listed as the worst in America. He talks to workers and townsfolk who are trying to live on minimum wage and those who have not had pay increases in many, many years. Large factories are closing down across America as companies use cheaper overseas labour in their manufacturing processes. Only one CEO agrees to an interview, the head of Nike, and he does not provide Michael with a happy ending to his film - Nike shoes are not manufactured in America and are made by teenage workers in Indonesia (minimum age of 14) - something the CEO has no problem with.

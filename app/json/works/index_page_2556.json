This episode sees filmmakers refuting the term &#8216;Poetic realism&#8217; which was coined to describe some of the films produced by the Carne-Prevert team just before the war. For the filmmakers, the productions simply reflect the ambient pessimism, the fear of an impeding war and the tragedies already occuring in Spain. Some of the outstanding works of the late 1930s comprise Renoir&#8217;s &#8216;La bete humaine&#8217;<em>, &#8216;La grande illusion&#8217;</em>, &#8216;La regle du jeu&#8217;<em> and &#8216;La Marseillaise&#8217;</em>, a film about the French revolution financed by popular subscribtion. Naturally enough, 1940 saw French film production reduced to an unprecedented low of thirty-nine films. Many film personnel were lost to the industry. A few (such as composer Maurice Jaubert) were killed in action, but most simply fled the country. Directors Jean Renoir, Rene Clair and Max Ophuls began new careers in Hollywood, while Alexandre Trauner and a number of other Jewish technicians sought temporary safety in the south (the &#8216;free&#8217; zone was later invaded by Germany). Although many personnel resettled in Nice or Marseilles, production facilities and capital remained in Paris. (&#8230;) Thanks largely to German finance and also an influx of filmmakers replacing those who had departed, after 1940 French film production began to increase, more than doubling in quantity by 1943. During the 1930s the German companies Tobis and UFA had produced many French films and they were now joined by Continental. With imports from America and Britain banned, the French film industry, censored and to some extent controlled by the Germans, could monopolise its captive audience. (&#8230;) Moreover, despite the desire of Joseph Goebbels, the German Propaganda Minister, that the French public should be fed a diet of empty and stupid films, a vibrant French film industry was a useful tool to placate the population and thus to deter resistance. The result was indeed a highly sucessful era for French cinema, albeit one characterised by escapism and fantasy, and shot almost entirely in a closed studio environment. Constrained by censorship but also reflecting a national desire for an escape from the present, Occupation cinema has been characterised as a cinema of isolation and immobility, dominated by historical subjects, lyrical fantasies and remote settings.

Episode four (1856-1868): &#8220;Death runs riot&#8221; (85 mins) - A myth had grown up about the West: &#8220;you could escape and be free&#8221;. The Americans began moving West in increasing numbers, staking claims on Indian land, clearing the land, building towns and cities. But with it came slavery, the American nation&#8217;s most divisive issue, bringing war and bloodshed and eventually the Civil War. Mexican-Americans also suffered persecution and removal by murder or otherwise at the hands of the Texas Rangers. The Cheyenne Peace Chiefs led by &#8220;Black Kettle&#8221; faced a losing battle with the whites and war and revenge would rage for many years.

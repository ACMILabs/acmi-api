Under the guidance of Mohamed Lotfi the inmates are given an opportunity to express themselves in regular studio activities where their need to be heard, catalysed by the jail environment and their experiences before and during their imprisonment, is nurtured and given form through words. A portrait of daily prison life and the inmates that participate in Lotfi&#8217;s program, a varied, sometimes tragic, sometimes hopeful picture of prison life and the circumstances that brought each person there is evoked. Through interviews with inmates, footage of the studio sessions and interviews with Lotfi and professional guests to the program this documentary investigates the drive for and discovery of freedom through language and the release of personal expression.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Radio", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Public speaking", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners - Attitudes", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners - Rehabilitation", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rehabilitation", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Activity programs in education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Public speaking", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Prison psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Rehabilitation", "Foreign language films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Public speaking", "Literature&nbsp;→ Creative writing"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2197977, "name": "Bruno Boulianne", "creator_id": 80475, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034697", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2197972, "name": "Eric Michel", "creator_id": 77368, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036053", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2197969, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1530721", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2197967, "name": "Society and Science Studio", "creator_id": 35697, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270650", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2197965, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51461", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33283]}, {"id": 95074, "acmi_id": "319119", "title": "Dogwatch", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dogwatch-dvd", "creator_credit": "Laurie McInnes, Richard Brennan, AFFC, Black Ray Films and Smile Production", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>From the director of &#8220;Broken Highway&#8221;, &#8220;Dogwatch&#8221; is a thriller set at sea aboard a rusty cargo ship with equally as dubious a crew.

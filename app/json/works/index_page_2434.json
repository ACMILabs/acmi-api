What follows is a series of tragic events and complications as Spansky and Gates attempt to retrieve the jewels, and Gabriella becomes involved with Jason. Ultimately, the deceitful are punished and the good set free. &#8220;Blood and Wine&#8221; has all the elements of film noir - lust, deceit, revenge, greed, crime, and, most importantly, the desire to escape conventional constraints. Bob Rafelson, who has carved out a reputation as a director of contemporary film noir, remaking such classics as &#8220;The Postman Always Rings Twice&#8221; (1981), and character-studies of drifting and alienation in middle-class America, continues in &#8220;Blood and Wine&#8221; his close collaboration with Jack Nicholson, making this their eighth film and the final instalment in a trilogy of films of &#8216;dysfunctional families&#8217;, including &#8220;Five Easy Pieces&#8221; (1970) and &#8220;The King of Marvin Gardens&#8221; (1972). Interweaving familial ties with criminal pursuit, &#8220;Blood and Wine&#8221; makes Oedipal themes - such as the struggle between father and son - typical of film noir more overt. Ultimately, stereotyped characters (sexy Latino, frustrated housewife, ruthless, exotic criminal) and an inability to reach the dramatic heights or transgressive thrills of classic noir makes &#8220;Blood and Wine&#8221; a rather conventional reworking of the genre.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Lust", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/blood-and-wine", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995499, "name": "Bob Rafelson", "creator_id": 24057, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q95039", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995498, "name": "Jeremy Thomas", "creator_id": 85651, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1365966", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995497, "name": "Blood and wine Productions", "creator_id": 33053, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49077", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [31184]}, {"id": 91693, "acmi_id": "314842", "title": "The Last valley", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-valley", "creator_credit": "James Clavell, ABC Pictures (US) and Season Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1970", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52457, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1171679"}], "brief_description": "<p>Set in 17th century Austria during the Thirty Years&#8217; War, &#8220;The Last valley&#8221; adapted from J.B.

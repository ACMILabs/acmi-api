Aside from these moments however, &#8220;Calle 54&#8221; fails to expand upon the potentially interesting stories behind the talent, resulting in what is essentially a performance piece celebrating Latin jazz and all its variations. Highlights include Chano Dominguez displaying his flair for merging flamenco and jazz; Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes (son of Bebe) playing a powerful solo; legendary percussionist Tito Puente and horn player Paquito D&#8217;Rivera in full swing; barefoot Brazilian Eliane Elias on piano; and the New York-based Jerry Gonzalez wigging out.

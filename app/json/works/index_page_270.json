Divine plays Rosie Velez, a voluptuous barmaid who encounters Clint Eastwood-esque gunfighter, Abel Wood (played by veteran actor Tab Hunter) in the desert. The performances of the cast of seasoned comic actors make up for the shortcomings of the script in this silly but fun, raunchy romp through a very wild Old West. Cast also includes Geoffrey Lewis, Laine Kazan, Cesar Romero and Henry Silva.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Parody", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/lust-in-the-dust", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997980, "name": "Paul Bartel", "creator_id": 28597, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1651660", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997979, "name": "Tab Hunter", "creator_id": 80355, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q725395", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997978, "name": "Alan Glaser", "creator_id": 80354, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997977, "name": "New World Pictures", "creator_id": 69197, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997976, "name": "Fox Run Productions", "creator_id": 35396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51188", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [33077], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93572, "acmi_id": "317078", "title": "La Cage aux Folles 3: the wedding", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-cage-aux-folles-3-the-wedding", "creator_credit": "Georges Lautner, Marcello Danon, Da Ma Produzione and Columbia Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1985", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Third and final installment of the &#8220;La Cage aux Folles&#8221; comedies begins with the St. Tropez nightclub of the title in serious financial trouble.

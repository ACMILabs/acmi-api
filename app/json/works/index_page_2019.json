Carpenter&#8217;s cult hit is a subversive and satirical take on a New York which was at the time (it was made in 1982), riddled with crime and corruption. The film also takes swipes at right wing paranoia by offering an alarming vision of how the average American would really like to solve escalating crime. Cast includes Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef and Adrienne Barbeau.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisons", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "People&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 36}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/escape-from-ny", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995810, "name": "John Carpenter", "creator_id": 51535, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q95008", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995808, "name": "Debra Hill", "creator_id": 51524, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262102", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995809, "name": "Larry Franco", "creator_id": 26733, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q521038", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995807, "name": "AVCO Embassy Pictures", "creator_id": 51583, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49776", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31823]}, {"id": 121920, "acmi_id": "P192782", "title": "Macolm yellow getaway car", "title_annotation": "Facsimile", "slug": "graphic-the-yellow-getaway-car-in-malcolm", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "<p>Courtesy Nadia Tass and David Parker</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1985", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2025-11-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Macolm yellow getaway car</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1985</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Courtesy Nadia Tass and David Parker</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Moving Australia&nbsp;→ MA-02.

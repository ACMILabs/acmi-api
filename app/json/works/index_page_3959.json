This program, with a 2002 update, combines television footage from ABC &#8220;Four corners&#8221; and &#8220;7.30 Report&#8221; including interviews with refugees, Philip Ruddock (Minister for Immigration) and John Olsen (the then Premier of South Australia) among others, with discussion on the situation of asylum seekers, legal and illegal, the rules for obtaining protection and temporary protection visas and the Australian Government&#8217;s position on this vexing and controversial issue. Suitable for Years 9-12 Secondary and Tertiary students.

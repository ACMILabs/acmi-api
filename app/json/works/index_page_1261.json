In 18th century London, paradoxically named the Age of Reason by the people, a popular past-time for upper classes was to visit St. Mary&#8217;s of Bethlehem Asylum - &#8220;Bedlam&#8221; - to observe its &#8220;loonies&#8221;. After the death of a young poet attempting to escape Bedlam leaves the wealthy Lord Mortimer without a commissioned play, the sinister head of the Asylum, Master George Sims, steps in and offers to stage a mask performed by the inmates of his Asylum. Intrigued, Mortimer&#8217;s young protege Mistress Nell Bowen decides to pay the Asylum a visit, but becomes rapidly disgusted and offended by Sims&#8217; brutal and sadistic treatment of the inmates. With advice from Quaker stonemason William Hannay, she resolves to stop the mistreatment and bring about reform.

Shunned by those whom she once called friends, Nell finds friendship and hope among the tortured souls imprisoned in the madhouse, and her quest to reform the system becomes more urgent. However, the inmates have their own ideas about reform, and justice is served to their cruel tormentor in a most macabre manner, in a scene lifted from Edgar Allen Poe.

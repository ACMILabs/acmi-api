Also discussed is the structure and fundamental operations of the UN.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ International agencies", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Developing countries", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - United States", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - Historical perspectives", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - History", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ International agencies", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Developing countries", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ International agencies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ International cooperation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United Nations", "History&nbsp;→ United Nations", "History&nbsp;→ War - Historical perspectives", "History&nbsp;→ War - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2405786, "name": "Marcel De Hubsch", "creator_id": 14330, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2405785, "name": "ATLANTIC FILM", "creator_id": 17444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

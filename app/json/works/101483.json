In &#8216;If Every Girl Had a Diary&#8217;, Benning trains her Pixelvision camera on herself and her room, searching for a sense of identity and respect as a woman and a lesbian.

Recorded against a backdrop of pornographic images and phone sex ads, Benning portrays the innocence of female romance, and the taboo prospect of female marriage.

Mass literacy vastly changes the political awareness of ordinary citizens and newspapers bring politics to the masses in Britain and the United States. The suffragette movement is also in full swing, while the colonies work towards self government.

Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1914: killing fields&#8221;; Europe and Germany are drawn into a new kind of war - an industrialized war in which logistics and machine guns make a devastating and significant debut. There is the first full scale project of propaganda against the Germans, as battles at the Somme, Verdun and Ypres facilitate the slaughter of thousands of soldiers on both sides of the battle. The war ends in 1918 with an armistice and no clear victor, as well as a new distrust of public figureheads who allowed the slaughter to continue.

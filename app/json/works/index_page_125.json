His wife (Blair Brown) is frustrated with Jonah&#8217;s continual life on the road and wants him to begin to take up the responsibilities that come with marriage and age. Simon wrote the music and songs for this film which forms a musical counterpart to the narrative. As much as it is about music and performance, the film is also an examination of what happened to the ideals and hopes of the hippie generation once it aged. Cast also includes Rip Torn, Joan Hackett and Lou Reed and features cameo appearances by Tiny Tim, soul legends Sam and Dave, the Lovin&#8217; Spoonful and the B-52s.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Responsibility", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ B 52's (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ B 52's (Musical group)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/one-trick-pony", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958433, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958434, "name": "Michael Hausman", "creator_id": 21896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958435, "name": "Michael Tannen", "creator_id": 79189, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958436, "name": "Robert Young", "creator_id": 12987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46718", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [29086], "external_references": [{"id": 5060, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "42157"}]}, {"id": 118039, "acmi_id": "Z000180", "title": "Jaara Nyilamum", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jaara-nyilamum", "creator_credit": "Lou Bennett AM and Romaine Moreton", "credit_line": "<p>Dr Romaine Moreton (Goenpul Yagerabul Minjungbal Bundjalung) and Dr Lou Bennett AM (Dja Dja Wurrung, Yorta Yorta)</p>\n<p>Single-channel video, 7.39 mins</p>\n<p>Filmed and edited by Dr Romaine Moreton</p>\n<p>Co-directed by Dr Romaine Moreton and Dr Lou Bennett AM</p>\n<p>Jaara Nyilamum (song composition) Performed by Dr Lou Bennett AM and the Australian String Quartet</p>\n<p>Composed by Dr Lou Bennett AM</p>\n<p>Arranged by Iain Grandage</p>\n<p>Produced by Stephen Snelleman</p>\n<p>Engineered by Russell Thomson</p>\n<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2021", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2031-02-16", "is_context_indigenous": true, "material_description": "H264 projection,16:9, colour", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2021-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>2021, Romaine Moreton (Goenpul Yagerabul Minjungbal Bundjalung), Lou Bennett AM (Dja Dja Warrung, Yorta Yorta)<br />\nFilmed &amp; Edited by Romaine Moreton, Co-Directed by Romaine Moreton &amp; Lou Bennett AM<br />\nH264 projection,16:9, colour, 7:39 mins<br />\nJaara Nyilamum (song composition) Performed by Dr Lou Bennett AM and the Australian String Quartet, Composed by Dr Lou Bennett AM, Arranged by Iain Grandage, Produced by Stephen Snelleman</p>\n<p>Dr Lou Bennett is a Performer, Songwriter, Musical and Artistic Director, Composer, Actor, Soundscape Designer and Academic.

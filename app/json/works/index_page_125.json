Unfolding as a series of thirty-second vignettes, this enigmatic essay in style is characterized by a deadpan theatricality, symbolist imagery, surrealist juxtapositions and repetition of key visual motifs. Indelible images, precisely composed &#8212; a man teetering above a waterfall, a floating chair, a winking eye, a parrot against the New York skyline &#8212; are accompanied by an &#8216;architectural&#8217; sound score that includes spoken &#8216;phonetic patterns&#8217; rather than words. Fusing his surprising visual logic and rhythms with unexpected temporal manipulations, Wilson creates a work of startling wit and poetry.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2628572, "name": "Robert Wilson", "creator_id": 5221, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q541526", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2628575, "name": "Caroline Arrighi", "creator_id": 6452, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035008", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2628576, "name": "Robert Boner", "creator_id": 6453, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299339", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2628577, "name": "Film and Video Collectif and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF)", "creator_id": 6454, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299415", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2628574, "name": "Renato Berta", "creator_id": 73174, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "lighting", "role_id": 447, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2628573, "name": "Allan Lloyd", "creator_id": 73173, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360993", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "128", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}, {"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [47457]}, {"id": 107961, "acmi_id": "B1000134", "title": "The Reflecting pool: collected work 1977-80", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-reflecting-pool-collected-work-1977-80", "creator_credit": "Bill Viola, Bruce Hutter, Mike Ballenger, Artists' Television Workshop at WXXI/TV, Rochester, Carol Brandenburg, Carvin Eison and TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "1977-1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Viola describes The Reflecting Pool as &#8216;a collection of five independent works which, taken as a whole, describe the stages of a personal journey using images of transition &#8212; from day to night, motion to stillness, time to timelessness, etc. Each work explores specific video techniques and technologies, in combination with the spatial potentials of stereo sound.&#8217; In the title work, all movement and change in an otherwise still scene is confined to the reflections on the surface of a pool in the woods.

So begins Global Groove, a seminal tape in the history of video art. This radical manifesto on global communications in a media-saturated world is rendered as a frenetic electronic collage, a sound and image pastiche that subverts the language of television. With surreal visual wit and an antic neo-Dada sensibility, Paik manipulates an emblematic pastiche of multicultural elements, artworld figures and Pop iconography. Pepsi commercials appropriated from Japanese television are juxtaposed with performances by avant-garde artists John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Allen Ginsberg and the Living Theatre; dancers moving in a synthesized, colorized space to Mitch Ryder&#8217;s Devil with a Blue Dress On are intercut with traditional Korean dancers. Charlotte Moorman, her image wildly synthesized, plays the TV Cello; Paik and Moorman play the TV Bra for Living Sculpture; Richard Nixon&#8217;s face is distorted by a magnetically altered television. In an ironic form of interactive television, Paik presents &quot;Participation TV,&quot; in which he instructs viewers to open or close their eyes. Paik subjects this transcultural, intertextual content to an exuberant, stream-of-consciousness onslaught of disruptive editing and technological devices, including audio and video synthesis, colorization, ironic juxtapositions, temporal shifts and layering &#8212; a controlled chaos that suggests a hallucinatory romp through the channels of a global TV. With its postmodern content, form and conceptual strategies, Global Groove has had a profound influence on video, television and contemporary art.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Global groove</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Charlotte Moorman, Nam Paik, Merrily Mossman and TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1973</p>", "description": "<p>`This is a glimpse of the video landscape of tomorrow, when you will be able to switch to any TV station on the earth, and TV Guide will be as fat as the Manhattan telephone book.&#8217; So begins Global Groove, a seminal tape in the history of video art.

The film is influenced by the sumptuous cinema of Visconti and Bertolluci, combining social observation with lavish tableaus of everyday life. From the opening wedding sequence to the nightmarish scenes in a prisoner of war camp, &#8220;The Deer Hunter&#8221; is a consistently astounding film that refuses to situate itself as either pro or anti War. Rather than tackling the specific history of the Vietnam war, it becomes instead a moving allegory on all war and on the destruction, it reaps on the psyches of both the victor and the conquered. &#8220;The Deer Hunter&#8221; won an Academy Award for Best Film and remains one of the best films ever made about war. With Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage and Meryl Streep. The astonishing cinematography is by Vilmos Zsigmond.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Veterans", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Vietnam War, 1961-1975", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-deer-hunter", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960613, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960614, "name": "EMI/Parlophone", "creator_id": 14659, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960615, "name": "Barry Spikings", "creator_id": 77922, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960616, "name": "Michael Deeley", "creator_id": 2787, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960617, "name": "Michael Cimino", "creator_id": 77662, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960618, "name": "John Peverell", "creator_id": 79829, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960619, "name": "Michael Cimino", "creator_id": 77662, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960612, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49935", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [31954], "external_references": [{"id": 5765, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11778"}]}]}

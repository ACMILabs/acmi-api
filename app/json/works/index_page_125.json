In a sleepy seaside resort town, Hulot is the centre of increasing chaos: deckchairs behave anarchically, a summer Ball turns into a disaster. Amidst it all Mr. Hulot wanders around oblivious to the madness. &#8220;Mr. Hulot&#8217;s Holiday&#8221; is a beautifully orchestrated piece of comic cinema and widely considered Tati&#8217;s funniest film.

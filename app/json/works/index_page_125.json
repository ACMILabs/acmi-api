Both dream of one day escaping from the mill, Sean as a tap dancer in Sydney and Mitchell purchasing a tow truck to get out of the only life their stern father has ever known. Tension arrises between the brothers when Sean quits the mill to go to Sydney to study with a well known dance troupe and Mitchell moves in on Sean&#8217;s woman, Linda (Sophie Lee), both brothers finding themselves in love with her. &#8220;Bootmen&#8221; is a feel-good movie that is similar in genre to &#8220;Strictly Ballroom&#8221; and &#8220;The Full Monty&#8221;, a touching and sweet film with wonderful tap dancing sequences. Cast also includes William Zappa, Richard Carter and Susie Porter.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Closed captioning", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Conception", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tap dancing", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1169885, "name": "Dein Perry", "creator_id": 34214, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169884, "name": "Hilary Linstead", "creator_id": 221, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169883, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1169882, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19643, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/zFvvx57ZnOiVjzyvwFlaltJa7yE.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Bootmen  (Dein Perry) still", "credit_line": "Image via themoviedb.org", "alt_text": "", "width": 960, "height": 1440, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50050", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32060]}, {"id": 92492, "acmi_id": "49968", "title": "Chopper [DVD] (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "chopper-dvd-d", "creator_credit": "Andrew Dominik, Michele Bennett and Palace Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/szuw8hufPHfIJnQCATGFQpI2SW6.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This AFI award winning film is based on the life of Mark Brandon - &#8220;Chopper&#8221; - Read, a notorious Australian criminal who became a best selling author, publishing 9 books of his life and times as a key stand man in Melbourne&#8217;s underworld.

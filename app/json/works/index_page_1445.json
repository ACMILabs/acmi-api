Along the way Flynt gets dragged to court by several exponent of the religious right, intent on defending the &#8220;decent folks&#8221;. At every turn, Larry fights back, using a tactic of high antics and retreat behind the &#8220;First Amendment&#8221;. Courted by the Pentecostal movement and Ruth Carter (Jimmy&#8217;s sister) played by Donna Hannover, he finally converts, only to give his campaign for &#8220;free speech and porn for all&#8221; the overtones of a crusade. The true life story of Larry Flynt is rich in sex, drugs, making money - and an assassination attempt. Who is Larry Flynt: a hedonistic, obnoxious pornograph or or an unlikely freedom of speech campaigner whose ardour is only tamed by drug addiction, mental illness, and Althea&#8217;s failing health? This film won two Oscar nominations to Forman and Harrelson. Winner of Golden Bear, Berlin - 1997.

Sissy is essentially a social outcast in search of a family who will accept her and her oversized thumbs. After spending time in New York as a model, Sissy finds herself at the Rubber Rose Ranch on an assignment, where she meets and falls in love with Bonanza Jellybean (Rain Phoenix). Jellybean is planning to take over the ranch from The Countess (John Hurt) and Miss Adrian (Angie Dickinson). The film is riddled with other subplots involving peyote, whooping cranes and a mountain-man prophet, The Chink (Pat Morita), with whom Sissy forms a relationship. Cast also includes Roseanne Arnold, Buck Henry, Sean Young, Crispin Glover, Keanu Reeves, Heather Graham and a cameo by William Burroughs.

With artificial intelligence (AI), Joel Sherwood Spring has created landscapes in the style of acclaimed Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira being torn apart by mining machinery, and has trained another AI to answer questions like “Who’s your Mob?” Presumably, anyone could do this – but should anyone be able to appropriate Indigenous art from the internet?

In danger of losing Phuong to the American, Fowler is drawn into a suspicious and venomous state, convinced that the American is supplying explosives to non-Communist troops. &#8220;The Quiet American&#8221; leaves the more contentious political elements of Graham Greene&#8217;s novel to languish in favour of highlighting the personal grief of a middle-aged man in crisis. Redgrave is impressive as Fowler, whose voice-over narration relays comprehension of his fate, and his disastrous attempt to fight it. Remade in 2002 by Phillip Noyce.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Vietnam", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Americans in Vietnam", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Imperialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Vietnam - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Vietnam - Social Conditions", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Vietnam - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Vietnam", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-quiet-american-1958", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963060, "name": "Figaro Films", "creator_id": 26954, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963061, "name": "Joseph L Mankiewicz", "creator_id": 22015, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51482", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1958", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1958"}], "labels": [33291], "external_references": [{"id": 980, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q431531"}, {"id": 6175, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "85514"}]}, {"id": 91443, "acmi_id": "314563", "title": "The Quick and the dead", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-quick-and-the-dead-dvd", "creator_credit": "Tri-Star Pictures, Joshua Donin, Allen Shapiro, Patrick Markey and Sam Raimi", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1995", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Ellen (Sharon Stone), a female gunslinger, arrives in the town of Redemption for a quick-draw contest.

The first Europeans to set foot in the West was in 1528 by a small group of shipwrecked Spanish soldiers lead by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca. This episode tells of the Spanish invasion and conquest, their religious fervour and hunger for land and the devastation which their wars, famine and diseases brought upon the native Indian.

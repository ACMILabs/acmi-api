We see good close ups of children’s faces as they interact with the wizard.</p>\n<p>We then see a school boy walking and running down a country road where he discovers animal tracks in the dirt and encounters a woman wearing a red coat carrying apples in a basket.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of school fashion, children’s faces and farming practices.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights (timecodes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:49:00 - Title card Story &#8216;The Bear&#8217;<br />\n00:01:05:00 - Burning off with tractor<br />\n00:02:56:00 - Title card &#8216;the wish wizard&#8217;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:09:53:12"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Farming", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fashion - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Children - Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Games", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Standard 8mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114452, "acmi_id": "B2003990", "title": "[Kirsty Sword Gusmão Film Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kirsty-sword-gusmao-film-collection", "creator_credit": "Kirsty Sword Gusmão", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, Indonesia and United States", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "30 x reels 8mm film\nSuper 8mm and regular 8mm film collection, anotated list of content provided by donor see documents references window.", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 100266, "acmi_id": "B2003991", "title": "[Kirsty Sword Gusmao Film Collection: Reel 1]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kirsty-sword-gusmao-film-collection-reel-1", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia and VIC/Australia, c. 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, {"id": 100267, "acmi_id": "B2003992", "title": "[Kirsty Sword Gusmao Film Collection: Reel 2]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kirsty-sword-gusmao-film-collection-reel-2", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia and VIC/Australia, c. 1960s", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "175802", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}, {"id": 40, "name": "VIC/Australia", "slug": "vicaustralia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1960-c. 1970", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1960-c. 1970"}], "labels": [39764]}, {"id": 100266, "acmi_id": "B2003991", "title": "[Kirsty Sword Gusmao Film Collection: Reel 1]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kirsty-sword-gusmao-film-collection-reel-1", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia and VIC/Australia, c. 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>This film shows a slice of life from a working dairy farm in central Gippsland, Victoria.</p>\n<p>We see cows being milked, the milk cans being loaded onto trucks and in to the trays of utility cars.

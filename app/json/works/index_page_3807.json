Sixteen year old Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a typical teenage girl in every respect except one, (she has been destined to slay vampires) moves to Sunnydale, California with her divorced mum. What she is unaware of however is that Sunnydale was built above the &#8216;hellmouth&#8217;, an evil dimension rife with demons and vampires. Buffy reluctantly finds herself burdened with slayer duties again while she struggles to fit into her new high school, date guys and get her homework done. Geller holds her own as the blonde wise cracking, ass-kicking vampire killer but creator Joss Whedon also surrounds her with a strong supporting cast that well and truly hold their own.

At the same time as his career appears to be crumbling apart, Jerzy&#8217;s wife has also decided to leave him for a younger colleague. Fundamentally a sympathetic character, the film follows Jerzy on his downward spiral as his whole world collapses in front of him. A story which subliminally hits out at the Polish system, but primarily a story of human relationships containing an interesting blend of drama, tragedy and humour. In Polish with English subtitles. Cast also includes Ewa Datkowska, Andrzej Seweryn, Krystyna Janda, Roman Wilhelmi.

Thus, Holmes and Watson are forced to join sides again on a case involving counterfeit 5 pound notes. All is progressing well until the appearance of Holmes/Watson&#8217;s nemesis, Professor Moriaty, then Watson disappears into the canal - presumed dead, and it&#8217;s up to the oft inebriated Holmes to solve his first case, unassisted, and prove his crime solving capacity to the dubious Inspector Lestrade. Cast also includes Lysette Anthony, Jeffrey Jones and Paul Freeman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960046, "name": "Thom Eberhardt", "creator_id": 33048, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960045, "name": "Mark Stirdivant", "creator_id": 33047, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960044, "name": "ITC Group", "creator_id": 33046, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19477, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bZWdV73Y4d98TEyrz2lqFkORkby.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Without a clue (Thom Eberhardt) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49074", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [31181]}, {"id": 88695, "acmi_id": "311292", "title": "Withnail & I", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "withnail-i", "creator_credit": "Bruce Robinson, Paul Heller and HandMade Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1987", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/32sI7M6TCbKFNftJyI5B6BXVZhM.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Screenwriter Bruce Robinson made his directorial debut with this British comedy which portrays the last throes of an eccentric friendship during the final days of the sixties.

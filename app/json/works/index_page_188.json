Exit stairs are wheeled up to plane, and the Queen and Duke step out.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The 1954 visit to Australia of newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 2 of the collection dwells on the decorations that celebrated the visit, in the streets and on the buildings of Melbourne&#8217;s CBD, then shows the officials and staff responsible for the planning and conduct of the tour at work inside the (now demolished) Geological Museum. We are shown the Victorian police reinforcements arranged for the visit being addressed by their commanders, before the scene shifts to Essendon Airport and the preparations for touchdown of the &#8216;royal&#8217; plane.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 2:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Melbourne: City decorations&#8221;, followed by footage of Melbourne CBD streets and buildings sporting decorations for the visit (Flinders Street Railway Station from Elizabeth Street, Myer Emporium, Swanston Street, the Leviathan Building, trams and cars). 00:00:54:00 shot of old Princes Bridge Railway Station (partially obscured). 00:01:15:00 The Commercial Bank of Australia. 00:01:25:00 decorated Melbourne Town Hall. 00:01:31:0 Foy and Gibson building. 00:01:35:00 emu and kangaroo diorama. 00:01:59:0 Title &#8220;Royal Visit Offices: Geological Museum&#8221; followed by footage of the exterior of the (now demolished) building in Macarthur Street, and scenes of the staff at work inside. 00:03:32:00 Title &#8220;Police Re-Inforcements: The Chief Commissioner and the Chief Secretary address 750 men prior to the visit.&#8221; followed by footage of uniformed police being addressed by the commanders. 00:04:25:00 Title &#8220;Official Landing &amp; Reception: Melbourne Airport - Overseas Terminal Wednesday, 24th.

Of particular note are the opening sequences of the reel which show Kenneth&#8217;s interest in devising creative and clever titles.

Highlights of the reel include the 1940s style of wedding and the wedding fashions of the era. Scenes at the wedding reception show some of the customs of day such as drinking an obligatory glass of sherry (usually upon arrival) and hosting the reception in the family home.

amateur cinematographer and filmmaker. This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film is comprised of two parts. Firstly, travelling on a road tour through South Gippsland from Wilson&#8217;s Promontory to Walhalla, Kenneth shows his appreciation of the Australian countryside as he shows the landscape, forests, shorelines and features around him. At times. Kenneth himself appears in the reel on the other side of camera. When at Wilson&#8217;s Promontary the footage indicates the style of camping at the time: individual cabins alongside shared facilities likely to have included bathrooms, kitchen and laundry and recreation rooms. Kenneth also shows the old goldtown of Walhalla with its deserted atmosphere. The last part of the reel shows a waterski regatta and speed boats on Albert Park Lake in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:</p>\n<p>(No title)<br />\n00:00:00:00 to 00:00:27:00 distant views and roads on the way though what we will come to know is Gippsland.</p>\n<p>00:00:32:00 &#8216;Wilson&#8217;s Promontory&#8217; sign, posted alongside the Darby Bridge, its sign and Bob Wootton standing on the bridge.</p>\n<p>00:00:38:00 Kenneth Rankine himself looking out over the Darby River.</p>\n<p>00:00:45:00 to 00:01:40:00 views of the sea over low lying hills followed by shots of teatree, country roads leading down to the sea, views of the coastline, rocky hills and flower shots.</p>\n<p>00:01:42:00 &#8216;Tidal River&#8217; camping grounds. Just before departing the Prom, there is a lovely view of what appears to be Norman Bay near Tidal River.</p>\n<p>00:02:04:00 a sign for &#8216;Port Welshpool&#8217; followed by views of an estuary at low tide, several piers and fishing boats.</p>\n<p>00:02:36:00 a fisherman appears (as indicated by thigh high galoshes) walking along a pier and chatting to Bob Wootton.</p>\n<p>00:03:01:00 a sign for the &#8216;Balook Private Hotel Excellent Accommodation&#8217;.</p>\n<p>00:03:28:00 after more hillsides and views we see a sign for &#8216;Bulga Park Shire of Alberton&#8217; (which existed 1855 to 1994; currently Shire of Wellington).</p>\n<p>00:04:28:00 sign for Tarra Valley Park appears. In this footage Kenneth has gone to some trouble to capture the Parks, framing his shots of waterfalls, ferns and trees through bracken fronds, branches or rope walks to create a lush feel.</p>\n<p>00:06:32 the Corrigan Suspension (walk) Bridge. Shortly after, we are looking down on the Thomson River. Kenneth includes several shots of bridges including the first from which he takes footage of the river below.</p>\n<p>00:07:02:00 perhaps foot bridge evident by the scratched initials on the railing. Rail and road bridges are shot from different angles from 00:06:48 to 00:07:02:00.</p>\n<p>00:07:10:00 Walhalla Post Office; some deserted and derelict buildings, a shop sign for &#8216;Agent of the State Savings Bank Guaranteed by the Government of Victoria&#8217; on the door of a derelict Teashop, the Walhalla Station sign on a building which houses old carts with a shot of ‘1903’ on one of the carts, elaborate stone walls.</p>\n<p>00:08:11:00 a working timber mill. There are more shots of overgrown brick remnants of buildings in the steep hillsides, rail tracks and old cars.</p>\n<p>00:08:41:00 Bob Wootton works a rail lever to move the old tracks. Kenneth has taken views of the town that reflect the almost abandoned state of Walhalla at the time, following the end of the gold mining boom and after the ‘Black Friday’ bushfires that ravaged the State in 1939.</p>\n<p>00:08:54:00 program for the &#8216;A Speedboat and Water - Ski Regatta assisted by the Sirocco Cherokee and Yarrawonga Water Ski Clubs&#8217;, held at Albert Park Lake (Melbourne) in 1956. Footage of speedboat racing on the lake follows.</p>\n<p>00:10:21:00 a helicopter is filmed flying and hovering overhead.</p>\n<p>00:10:30:00 men water skiing; good examples of male swimming trunks.

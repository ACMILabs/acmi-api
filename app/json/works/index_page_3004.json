Revisiting his regular themes of chance vs fate and broken hearted loners, Wong Kar-Wai and Doyle (sharing his DOP duties with Lau Wai-Keung), again have created a heightened world of neon drenched cities and smokey bars, while the soundtrack repeats it&#8217;s ethereal refrain of the Mamas and the Papas California dreaming. The first story centers around the infamous Chungking mansions as a lovelorn cop, identified as No.223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) yearns over a mysterious woman (Brigitte Lin) in dark sunglasses and a Marilyn Monroe style wig. Unbeknownst to the sombre detective, who has a peculiar nostalgic attachment to crushed canned pineapple, the woman is working on the other side of the law as a small time heroin smuggler. The second randomly linked story is set around the Midnight Express fast-food joint where cop No.663 (Tony Leung) spends most of his nights, recovering over a break up with an air hostess (Valerie Chow), unaware that the young woman who works behind the counter (Hong Kong rock star Faye Wong) is quietly infatuated with him.

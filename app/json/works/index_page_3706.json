In the early part of the 20th century, Korea was ruled by Japan until the defeat of Japan at the end of WWII in 1945 when Korea split in two - South Korea backed by the United States and North Korea by the Soviet Union. By 1948 tensions between the two Koreas began to esculate. On 25 June 1950 the North Korean Peoples Army crossed the 38th Parallel to launch an offensive against the Republic of Korea (South). Calls for ceasefire were ignored and so began the Korean War (or as it became known in Australia, &#8220;The Forgotten War&#8221;). The United Nations sanctioned action in Korea against the North Korean Army, and Australia, under Prime Minister Robert Menzies, committed forces to the conflict.

In fact, the film opens with a high-energy sequence in which a group of men are gambling with dice; it only becomes clear later that this group comprises a doctor and his patients. This underscores Mati&#8217;s &#8216;eccentric&#8217; approach toward psychic recuperation, he favours love, warmth and compassion over clinical distance; an approach, however, which gets him into conflict with his superior, makes some of his colleagues uncomfortable and even confuses his students during lectures. Above all, Mati is shown to treat his patients as &#8216;humans&#8217;, and with exactly the same warmth and affection with which he relates to his family and friends in the &#8216;normal&#8217; world. However, a gnawing sense of anxiety and paranoia leads the doctor to a crisis of confidence, triggered when one of his students questions his particular philosophy. A series of delusions and imaginings in which his approach is questioned and mocked culminates in hallucinatory madness, and it&#8217;s not until then that the doctor breaks through his crisis and re-gains a position of normality and confidence. &#8220;Beyond Reason&#8221; affirms its pro-humanity stance when it suggests how easily we can all slip into madness and how important understanding and sensitivity are at such times. Cast also includes Diana Muldaur, Laura Johnson and Marvin Laird.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental illness", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Patient care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1814039, "name": "Howard W.

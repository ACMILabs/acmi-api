Whilst competing in the revived National Skateboarder Championships, the tricks performed wowed those present and the Z-Boys ruled. This documentary uses extensive stills and footage from the era (some of it quite astounding) and intersperses it with contemporary interviews with the Z-boys, who reminisce about their glory days and the forces that shaped their destiny. MTV style editing, a plenitude of vintage material and a rocking soundtrack (including Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, Led Zepplin The Stooges and Jimi Hendrix) makes for great viewing.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ California", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Closed captioning", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fame", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fame", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Outdoor recreation", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Skateboarding", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surfboards", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surfing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Youth - Recreation", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ California"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964020, "name": "Stacy Peralta", "creator_id": 71697, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964019, "name": "Agi Orsi", "creator_id": 36409, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964018, "name": "Vans Off The Wall", "creator_id": 36408, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964017, "name": "AOP", "creator_id": 36407, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964016, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20285, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/eb02dpopuAhuThf7nXAAwKtAF88.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Dogtown and Z-boys (Stacy Peralta) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 800, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52336", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33926]}]}

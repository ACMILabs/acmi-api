The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good. The sound drops out early in the film for several seconds and is a little hard to understand at times.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 titles &#8216;The Walkabouters&#8217;, &#8216;Werribee Gorge Nov 1972&#8217;<br />\n00:01:13:00 putting up camping tents<br />\n00:01:37:00 taking a break at a picnic table near a campfire, possibly drinking wine from wine flagons<br />\n00:01;53:00 cooking sausages on a barbeque iron plate over the open flames, sitting in 1970s style folding chairs<br />\n00:02:02:00 an old utility style truck with participants packed in the back as other participants set off walking<br />\n00:02:38:00 assisting each other as hikers are traversing a rocky creek and bending under the barbed wire of a farm fence while others hold wire up<br />\n00:03:51:00 using cameras and binoculars while listening to a guide or club member talking about the Gorge, followed by precarious crossing over water by using an old fallen tree<br />\n00:04:50:00 views around the landscape<br />\n00:06:05:00 hikers rest among the trees<br />\n00:08:10:00 views around the landscape and from a higher vantage point down to the river and tents<br />\n00:09:16:00 getting rock samples<br />\n00:09:50:00 views of the Werribee River and the rocky steep banks<br />\n00:10:15:00 views along the river, rocky outcrops and trickling waterfalls<br />\n00:11:09:00 preparing a meal back at base camp<br />\n00:12:12:00 eggs and bacon cooking on the open fire and a view of the tents<br />\n00:12:49:00 clambering over a farm gate<br />\n00:12:58:00 horses and cows<br />\n00:14:12:00 a colourful bug on a leaf<br />\n00:15:12:00 soaking tired feet in the creek<br />\n00:18:40:00 sign for &#8216;Blackwood Pottery&#8217; followed by the pottery studio<br />\n00:19:15:00 views around the studio and potters at their wheels<br />\n00:20:15:00 the pottery kiln<br />\n00:21:31:00 an old cement camp fireplace barbeque with billies boiling and meat cooking<br />\n00:21:49:00 serving the billy tea at a park picnic table<br />\n00:22:08:00 eating the barbequed chops in bread, sleeping under a tree and photographing the scenery<br />\n00:23:53:00 close-ups of wildflowers<br />\n00:25:17:00 outdoor eating back at the tents<br />\n00:25:26:00 canoeing down the river<br />\n00:26:09:00 title &#8216;The End&#8217;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 28]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

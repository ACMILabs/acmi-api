Combining horror, suspense and extremely dry satire, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is a meditation on excess and the loss of personal identity. Considering the controversial nature of Bret Easton Ellis&#8217;s novel, director Mary Harron and co-script writer Guinevere Turner have transliterated the work with remarkable wit and insight. The film maintains the ambiguous balance between what may be a horrific reality or an elaborate fantasy of a desperately lost soul. Cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Bulgarian", "Czech", "English", "English", "English", "Hungarian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Materialism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/american-psycho", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1972846, "name": "Mary Harron", "creator_id": 10194, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972845, "name": "Edward Pressman", "creator_id": 23171, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q357726", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972844, "name": "Columbia Tristar", "creator_id": 32918, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1972843, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48810", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [30936], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91445, "acmi_id": "314565", "title": "Flatliners", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "flatliners-dvd", "creator_credit": "Joel Schumacher, Rick Bieber, Michael Douglas, Stonebridge Entertainment and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A group of medical students are determined to experience the afterlife by putting themselves in a near-death state and reviving themselves at the last minute.

However, the main thing that sets her apart from the others - her magical ability - soon draws the attention of fellow misfits Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell) and Rochelle (Rachel True), who try to recruit her as the fourth member of their coven. Sarah is at first unwilling to enter their world of magic and ritual, afraid of her own untapped powers and sceptical of the others&#8217; euphoric worship of the deity, Manon, but when her reputation is ruined after an encounter with the school&#8217;s most popular boy, Chris (Skeet Ulrich), she reconsiders. The four bind themselves into a formal coven one afternoon and cast their first spell as a group: Rochelle asks for revenge on a racist class-mate, Sarah asks that Chris fall in love with her, Bonnie asks for the severe burn scars that cover her body to be removed, and Nancy asks for all the power of Manon. Empowered by Sarah, a natural witch, their spells have the desired results, and the group becomes more close-knit as they continue their occult explorations. Feeling guilty about what she has done to Chris, Sarah seeks advice from the proprietor of the local occult shop, Lirio, who advises the group to be careful, as whatever they send out will return to them times three. The others ignore this advice and group leader Nancy soon becomes corrupted by the powers she is given after a midnight invocation on a stormy beach, resulting in the death of Chris. When Sarah suggests that the others practice more caution, they turn on her, tormenting her ceaselessly after she leaves their circle. Caught in a struggle between reality and illusion, Sarah is forced to invoke a greater power to help defend her against Nancy&#8217;s maliciously twisted magic.

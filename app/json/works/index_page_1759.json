Born in Budapest, Hungary, Tibor lived in Melbourne, Victoria with his family. His wife Merna Koller was a frequent collaborator on these films, showing a shared interest in filmmaking.</p>\n<p>Tibor captured suburban family life in Melbourne, including family celebrations, urban scenes and regional holidays. Tibor was actively engaged in the lapidary society of Australia. Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller. The films were made on Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains footage of a visit to the Gresswell Sanatorium in Mont Park, Victoria, which at the time housed and treated male patients with tuberculosis. Mont Park was an area north-east of Melbourne comprising several health institutions, including the Gresswell Sanatorium which was named after Dan Gresswell, a public health administrator. The film provides an insightful look at life in the sanatorium, including recreational activities and health care.</p>\n<p>This film was made on Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 great example of a handpainted sign reading &#8216;Repatriation Sanatorium, Drive Slow, Gresswell Sanatorium&#8217;<br />\n00:00:13:00 a 1940s style bus with logo &#8216;Heidelberg Motor Omnibus Service Pty.

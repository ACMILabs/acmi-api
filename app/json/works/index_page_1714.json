is a beautifully scripted and directed film about a sixteen-year-old boy, David (Jacob Tierney) and his reminiscings of his childhood in the bible belt of rural Georgia during the 1940s. An abusive and overbearing father (Denis Leary), a mother (Diana Scarwid) struggling to maintain normality under bleak and impoverished conditions and Aunt Mae (Gena Rowlands), a former glamorous nightclub singer, make up David&#8217;s immediate family but it is Aunt Mae who provides the excitement in David&#8217;s otherwise lonely, sometimes, harsh life. The recollections are made up of fragmented images, poignant and melancholy, rich in their intensity and atmospheric in mood.

Gardens - literally, pieces of land removed from their natural environments - have existed as sites of refuge, worship and meditation, served as accessories to political power, and provided humans with new ways of expressing art. From the cloistered medicinal gardens of medieval Europe to modern open parklands enclosed by cityscapes, gardens document &#8220;as much of the spirit of a period as its literature, its paintings or its sculpture&#8221;. Some of the stunning gardens explored in more detail include those at Villandry (France), Vaux-le-Vicomte (France), Hadrian&#8217;s Villa (Tivoli, Italy), Villa Garzoni (Collodi, Italy) Queen Eleanor&#8217;s Garden (Hampshire, UK), Hampton Court Palace (Surrey, UK), and the Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew, UK).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Botanical gardens", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Gardens - England", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Gardens - France", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Botanical gardens", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Cottage gardens, English", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Flowers", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - Design", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - England", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - France", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - History", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Landscape gardening", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Medicinal plants", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Trees", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Renaissance - Italy", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Sculpture", "Documentary", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicinal plants", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Medieval", "History&nbsp;→ Renaissance - Italy", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Switzerland"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1807907, "name": "Philippe Guerdat", "creator_id": 33339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 911340, "name": "Libraprim S A", "creator_id": 33338, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 911342, "name": "Philippe Guerdat", "creator_id": 33339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 911343, "name": "Luc Weber", "creator_id": 79710, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 911339, "name": "AFI [au]", "creator_id": 9711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49554", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 26, "name": "Switzerland", "slug": "switzerland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [31630], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92192, "acmi_id": "315413", "title": "The West.

For this animated version, Geoff Dunbar has invented a brutal graphic style and &#8216;language&#8217; of sounds to re-create the explosive impact of Jerry&#8217;s original production. Animated by Geoff Dunbar, Annabel Jankel, Ian Lewis, Ginger Gibbons and assisted by Tony Barnes and Gail Wright. Based on the play &#8216;Ubu Roi&#8217; by Alfred Jarry.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:18:25:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 860054, "name": "Geoff Dunbar", "creator_id": 16220, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q41330312", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 860053, "name": "Arts Council of Great Britain", "creator_id": 11978, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 860052, "name": "Grand Slamm Animation", "creator_id": 18525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29867", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [13629]}, {"id": 76527, "acmi_id": "014555", "title": "U.S.A.", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "usa", "creator_credit": "Henry Strauss Productions and Ideal Pictures (US)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1955", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1955-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A visual account of the life, industries, environment and history of the USA.

The Palatine Chapel in Aachen (Germany), an octogonal building modelled on a Byzantine church, was to be his final resting place in 814. It remains a potent symbol of the wealth and power of the Carolingian dynasty. The influence of Byzantine art in Roman imperial art is also illustrated with the example of San Pedro de Roda (Spain). Other main works profiled in this first episode include: Tournus (Burgundy), the Bayeux tapestry, monastries of Reichenau, Echternach, Bamberg, Hildesheim and Liege.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny.<br />\nCast: Narrated by Georges Duby.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 891313, "name": "Roland Darbois", "creator_id": 83313, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "147142", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [55902]}, {"id": 116085, "acmi_id": "X000267", "title": "L'etrange Monsieur Victor = the Strange Mr. Victor", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "letrange-monsieur-victor-the-strange-mr-victor", "creator_credit": "Jean Gremillon, Albert Valentin and Raoul Ploquin", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1938", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1938-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A respectable businessman during the day, Monsieur Victor is also the boss of gang of thieves.

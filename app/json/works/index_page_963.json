In &#8216;Extrasensory perception&#8217;, watch sharks use electrosensors to track prey, and see a flight over the Sydney Opera House through the eyes of a parrot using ultraviolet light as a guide. &#8216;Outer limits&#8217; explores incredible feats of endurance; lungfish burrowing into mud to escape droughts, and red sided garter snakes &#8220;defrosting&#8221; themselves after a cold snap. &#8216;Hidden forces&#8217; looks at the internal magnet which draws green turtles back to the beaches of their birth to breed, and how fire ants are attracted to electric currents. &#8216;Time warp&#8217; investigates how animal size and heart-rate are linked to lifespan. &#8216;Paranormal&#8217; looks at the more bizarre side of nature; lizards who squirt blood from their eyes to deter predators and chickens and crocodiles who play dead when hypnotised. &#8216;Close encounters&#8217; looks at the role enhanced senses play in animal life, using the story of Whisky, a truck-driver&#8217;s dog, and his six month journey to track down his owner.

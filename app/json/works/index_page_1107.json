Lonely and desperate she boards the first train heading south. Aboard, she meets vineyard heir Bertrand Meyrand and his wife Patricia, also 8 months pregnant. During the night, the train is derailed.

When Helene wakes up at the hospital, she realises that everyone mistakes her for Patricia, including Bertrand&#8217;s parents who offer her shelter at their wine growing property.

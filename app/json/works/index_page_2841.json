Benjamin is an underground musician, speed freak, occasional drag queen and HIV+ homosexual man playing punk, fronting the queer-core band Opal Foxx Quartet before forming the blues-oriented band Smoke. Benjamin is from Cabbagetown, Atlanta, home of the go-cart and a mill town where, in Benjamin&#8217;s youth, people were poor and drugs and hustlers were in abundance.

This compassionate portrait is quite riveting and fairly down-beat but is also an inspiring chronicle of the human spirit.

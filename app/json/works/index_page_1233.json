The pressures of friendship, family, identity and blackfella versus whitefella lifestyles, almost jeopardise Doug&#8217;s chances of achieving his dream. He goes back to his old ways, but unexpectedly the tables turn and it is Floyd who acts to save Doug&#8217;s dream, and give him hope for the future. BLACKFELLAS is based on the book &#8220;Day of the dog&#8221; by Archie Weller, a Perth writer who grew up with the Nyoongah people from the Perth area and James Ricketson, the writer/director of BLACKFELLAS, consulted extensively with the Nyoongah community during the development of the script. It is a moving and powerful study of Aboriginal society which is shown from an insider&#8217;s perspective, producing a sensitive and compassionate drama.

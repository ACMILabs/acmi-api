Rogerson and Smith&#8217;s activities are threatened when a young police officer, Michael Drury (Steve Bastoni), declines a bribe offered to him by Rogerson. From that moment on, &#8220;Blue Murder&#8221; depicts how Drury&#8217;s involvement in acting as an informer on Rogerson&#8217;s activities led to increasing desperate and murderous acts by both police and crims. Acclaimed internationally as a landmark television mini-series, &#8220;Blue Murder&#8221; was for years unable to be screened in NSW or available for view on video in Australia due to elements of the story being seen as prejudicial to legal trials in NSW and Federal Courts. Apart from the leads, the mini-series features excellent performances by Alex Dimitriades, Peter Phelps and John Hargreaves.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television - Censorship", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Biographical", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic - Investigation", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police - New South Wales", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New South Wales - Politics and government", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2121225, "name": "Michael Jenkins", "creator_id": 68594, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16107356", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2121223, "name": "Rod Allan", "creator_id": 22423, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2121221, "name": "Southern Star Entertainment", "creator_id": 26294, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2121220, "name": "AFFC", "creator_id": 24545, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2121219, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2121217, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50526", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [32509], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65508, "acmi_id": "001341", "title": "Blue mould of tobacco", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blue-mould-of-tobacco", "creator_credit": "Eric Thompson and Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1961", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1961-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Recommended methods of controlling the Blue Mould disease which is a fungus living on tobacco plants.

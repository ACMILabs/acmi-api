Commissioned by the Federation Square Public Arts Program (with financial assistance from ACMI), the artists were asked to create a work that<br />\nspecifically responded to the labyrinth (the built-in passive air-conditioning system) underneath Federation Square. The resulting work, Undertow 1999, is a four-screen installation depicting a slow and weightless navigation through the interior of the Square&#8217;s functionary maze.Through the use of Steadicam technology and archival footage sourced from ACMI&#8217;s film collection, viewers move weightlessly through the space as though peering through their own viewfinder. Accompanied by an enveloping and complex soundscape, we encounter strange and abstract apparitions, levitating objects, mysterious air turbulence and other unstable<br />\nphenomena, which appear to seep, rupture and bounce throughout this subterranean world.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["PG", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1889184, "name": "Scott Horscroft", "creator_id": 6508, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1889183, "name": "Joyce Hinterding", "creator_id": 6507, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1889182, "name": "David Haines", "creator_id": 6506, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1889185, "name": "Emma Crimmings", "creator_id": 6328, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "189", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "12 SEP 2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "12 SEP 2000"}], "labels": [47477], "external_references": []}, {"id": 121789, "acmi_id": "B2000933", "title": "Don't really know how I feel about this movie...", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "is-blonde-a-fictionalised-look-at-marilyn-monroes-life-by-melbourne-director-andrew-dominik-honouring-or-exploiting-the-stars-legacy-reviews-are-divided-but-iconic-images-from-monroes-life-and", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "01 OCT 2022", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Digital screen recording of @cinerobz's Tik Tok", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Is Blonde, a fictionalised look at Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s life by Melbourne director Andrew Dominik, honouring or exploiting the star&#8217;s legacy?

Rather than being a sweeping epic, this film examines the fight of a small group of Protestants for survival in the mountainous Cevennes region. Some of the story is told using excerpts from the diary kept by an actual participant in the conflict. The movie is notable for its period authenticity and historical accuracy.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Rene Allio ; writers, Jean Jourdheuil, Rene Allio ; photography, Denys Clairval ; music, Philippe Arthuys.<br />\nCast: Francois Marthouret, Dominique Labourier, Rufus, Isabelle Sadoyan, Jacques Debary, Genevieve Mnich, Maurice Benichou, Suzy Rambaud, Jean Benguigui, Christine Laurent.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890676, "name": "Rene Allio", "creator_id": 82966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146784", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [55554], "external_references": []}, {"id": 86049, "acmi_id": "307650", "title": "Les Beaux souvenirs", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "les-beaux-souvenirs", "creator_credit": "Jean Dansereau, ONF | NFB and Francis Maikiewiez", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A middle-class wife leaves her husband with two young daughters.

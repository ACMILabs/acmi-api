As they are bathed in the glow of the dreamer&#8217;s imaginary, as they sway to the pulsing of the engulfing soundtrack and feel the dimensions of their own body altering in response to the shifts of scale and variations of weightlessness, they sense a slow but profound shift in their consciousness.</p>\n<p>Time passes in an unaccustomed manner, basic emotions like fear and attraction seem to offer themselves for fresh consideration. There is no pre-defined, &#8216;right&#8217; duration for an encounter with this work. Visitors tend to stay for as long as it takes to feel an alteration; this can be ten seconds, or it can be hours. The Passing might have a beginning, middle and end mapped into its 52-minute linear duration, but the installation is best regarded as an endless loop that circulates like an enormous conceptual mantra, always available for engagement and orientation. No matter where in the timeline a viewer first submerges into The Passing, they will almost instantly find themselves attuned to rhythms and<br />\nglimmers that can guide them along their own passage through memory and self-examination to enlightenment.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:54:19:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["M (15+)", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reflection (Philosophy)", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Birth, Hour of"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Musical soundtrack only"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, black and white and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816735, "name": "Artists' Television Workshop at WXXI/TV, Rochester", "creator_id": 6446, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816734, "name": "TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen", "creator_id": 6411, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1765545, "name": "Bill Viola", "creator_id": 6438, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1765553, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1765550, "name": "Thomas Pilgin", "creator_id": 73172, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "engineering", "role_id": 477, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1765549, "name": "Robert Campbell", "creator_id": 73171, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "assistant", "role_id": 450, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1765548, "name": "Donna Matorin", "creator_id": 73170, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "assistant", "role_id": 450, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1765547, "name": "Donna Matorin", "creator_id": 73170, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production manager", "role_id": 934, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1765546, "name": "Kira Perov", "creator_id": 72741, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production manager", "role_id": 934, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "127", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [47456], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115845, "acmi_id": "Z000139", "title": "Flames of love on the ice", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "flames-of-love-on-the-ice", "creator_credit": "Deng Yuan and Beijing Salon Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Roller skating expert Lin Jia Jun is involved in a traffic accident which forces him into prison as a result of killing a Hong Kong traveller.

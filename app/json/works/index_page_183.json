The history of the stone began in the seventeenth century when French merchant, Jean-Battiste Tavernier - travelling the world in search of exotic jewels - purchased a 112 carat diamond coloured an exquisite shade of blue. Tavernier sold this stone to King Louis XIV of France in 1668, who ordered it to be recut, and wore it on ceremonial occasions suspended from a ribbon.

During the French Revolution, the diamond was stolen during the looting of the crown jewels, and disappeared for several years before surfacing in the gem collection catalog of Henry John Hope, from whom the diamond takes its name. Following his death in 1839, the diamond passed through many hands, finally being bought by famed jeweler Pierre Cartier in 1909. Cartier showed the Hope Diamond to Mrs Evalyn Walsh McLean, an eccentric but wealthy patron, in 1910, but she disliked the setting, so Cartier had it reset, and offered it to her again.

Filmmaker John Walker investigates the continued appeal of fairy lore in a world obsessed with materialism and rational thinking in this beautifully filmed documentary filled with the stunning landscapes that have fuelled tales of fairy folk for generations. He travels to the moors of England, the Highlands of Scotland, and sacred sites within Ireland and Cape Breton, discussing the origins of fairy lore, sightings of &#8220;the little people&#8221; and modern attitudes to the fairy faith. Walker interviews artist Brian Froud and reveals the inspiration for his fairy artworks, discusses the reality and physical possibility of fairies with scholar in seeing the paranormal Dr. Mark Fox, and meets Eddie Lenihan, a storyteller who saves an old fairy thorn tree from being destroyed by town developers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Folklore", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Legends", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ Legends", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Literature&nbsp;→ Folklore", "Literature&nbsp;→ Legends", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2347525, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 86449, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347521, "name": "Kent Martin", "creator_id": 77370, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347519, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 86449, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347515, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347512, "name": "John Walker Productions", "creator_id": 36024, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2347507, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51998", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33633], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91383, "acmi_id": "314494", "title": "The Fair go: winning the 1967 referendum", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-fair-go-winning-the-1967-referendum", "creator_credit": "Pat Laughren, Open Learning Agency of Australia and Canute Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This documentary commemorates the 10 year campaign that won an unprecedented 90.77% Yes vote in the 1967 Referendum about Indigenous citizenship.

This semi-autobiographical musical drama is framed by Gideon&#8217;s conversations with a mysterious figure of nemesis the &#8220;Lady in White&#8221;. Following Gideon&#8217;s heart attack, the film assumes a surreal hallucinatory logic. Not only does Fosse borrow freely from the European classics &#8220;8 1/2&#8221; and &#8220;The Seventh seal&#8221; but he inverts the showbiz and life affirming &#8220;That&#8217;s entertainment&#8221; ethos of the traditional musical. Cast includes Roy Scheider, Jessica Lange, Ann Reinking and John Lithgow.

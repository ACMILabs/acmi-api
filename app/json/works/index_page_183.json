Makhmalbaf&#8217;s film, made before the terrorist bombing on the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001, is a deeply moving indictment of war.

Often &#8220;Kandahar&#8221; shows the limitations of being filmed in hazardous, difficult circumstances: the acting is not always consistent, some scenes are truncated and ragged.

Cast includes Dennis Haysbert, Michael Harris, Mel Harris, Sab Shimono and Dina Merrill.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;â†’ Sundance Film Festival - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;â†’ Ethnicity", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;â†’ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;â†’ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;â†’ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;â†’ Ethnicity", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;â†’ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;â†’ Amnesia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;â†’ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;â†’ Twins"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/suture", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998243, "name": "David Siegel", "creator_id": 80431, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5239781", "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998242, "name": "Scott McGehee", "creator_id": 80430, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3476266", "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998241, "name": "Kino-Korsakoff", "creator_id": 35561, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998240, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51357", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [33201], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93693, "acmi_id": "317234", "title": "My life in pink = Ma vie en rose [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "my-life-in-pink-ma-vie-en-rose-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Alain Berliner, Carole Scotta and Haut et Court", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This is a tale about a seven-year-old boy, from a loving family, happy and healthy, who has decided that when he grows up he wants to be a woman.

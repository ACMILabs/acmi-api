Morris reveals how these obsessions reflect not only their personalities and values but also elemental emotions and thoughts: fear and survival for the lion tamer; nature and its human manipulation for the topiary; the Other and the act of confronting something completely foreign for the mole-rat specialist; and the interface between machine and man, technology and life for the robot scientist. Morris interweaves early cinema footage with present-day material in a dreamlike, musical manner that emphasises the connections between each individual&#8217;s obsessions. Ultimately, what these individuals obsessions come to represent is less an eccentricity or weirdness and much more an act of attempting to come to a genuine understanding of the world, society and human life.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Rats", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Wild animals", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardening", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Portraits", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Individuality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Garden structures", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments", "People&nbsp;→ Portraits"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fast-cheap-and-out-of-control", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1975179, "name": "Errol Morris", "creator_id": 4115, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q977546", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975178, "name": "Fourth Floor Pictures", "creator_id": 35129, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50964", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32911], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93407, "acmi_id": "316836", "title": "Night of the living dead (1968)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "night-of-the-living-dead-1968", "creator_credit": "George A.

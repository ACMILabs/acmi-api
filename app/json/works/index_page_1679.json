Faithful to the original strip, in the first episode The Phantom is killed by the evil Dr. Bremmer and his equally evil henchmen. As the story continues, we see his son (Tyler) adopting his father&#8217;s costume and perpetuating the myth that The Phantom is back from the dead. Eventually scientists (evil) try to kill The Phantom for good so they can take the Lost City of Zoloz and replace The Phantom with an imposter to trick the natives into slavery. Will The Phantom survive? Will the natives succumb to evil? Cast includes: Kenneth R.

In 1985, he received international renown with &#8220;Tangos: the exile of Gardel&#8221; which was awarded the Special Prize of the Jury in Venice. &#8220;The Journey&#8221; (aka &#8220;The Voyage&#8221;) continues the strong political theme, albeit in a somewhat satirical way. The plot centres around 17 year-old Martin (Walter Quiroz) who sets out on his bicycle to find his long lost father, an anthropologist who was last reported as working in Brazil. His epic journey from Tierra del Fuego to Peru, the Andes highlands to the Amazon and finally to Brazil proves to be a life-changing, mind-opening experience revealing the political exploitation, environmental and cultural destruction and the sometimes absurd contradictions which exist in this unique and precious part of the world known as Latin America. Cast also includes Franklin Caicedo, Fito Paez, Carlos Carella, Ricardo Bartis, Angela Correa.

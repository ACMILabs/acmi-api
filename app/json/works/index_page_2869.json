Closing in 1989 after more than 30 years of business, the history of Maud&#8217;s parallels the the evolution of the lesbian community and the gay rights movement in the United States. Through the reminisces and coming out stories of some of the bar&#8217;s long standing patrons, and the use of personal and public archival footage, a largely repressed history of lesbian social life emerges, beginning with the secret world of lesbian bars in the 1940s, through to the frightening vice raids of the 1950s, the colorful gay counter culture of the 1960s and the golden era of gay and lesbian life in San Franscisco in the 1970s and ending with the a reflection on the profound shifts in queer culture that took place in the 1980s. A witty and informative look at the emergence of a distinctly lesbian cultural life with its own unique codes through the eyes of the lesbian women who contributed to its shape.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Counterculture - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Counterculture - United States", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Counterculture - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gay liberation movement", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay liberation movement", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Counterculture - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815683, "name": "Karen Kiss", "creator_id": 35302, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883099, "name": "Waterbearer Films", "creator_id": 35301, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883101, "name": "Paris Poirer", "creator_id": 35303, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51100", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [33032], "external_references": []}, {"id": 69511, "acmi_id": "321924", "title": "Last bus", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "last-bus", "creator_credit": "Ronald Smedley and BBC-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1969", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;BBC Scene&#8221;.<br />\nA docudrama featuring a group of teenage boys who attack a bus conductor on a late night journey.

This film allows great insight into the life of the reclusive composer and is a fitting tribute to the man who revolutionised musical performances by bringing vaudeville to the people in the streets.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composition (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Gershwin, George, 1898-1937", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Gershwin, Ira, 1896-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Vaudeville", "People&nbsp;→ Gershwin, George, 1898-1937", "People&nbsp;→ Gershwin, Ira, 1896-", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 222135, "name": "BBC-TV", "creator_id": 11912, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 222136, "name": "American Masters", "creator_id": 24768, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 222137, "name": "WNET (Television station : New York, N.Y.)", "creator_id": 12342, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 222138, "name": "Unitel", "creator_id": 21610, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 222139, "name": "Peter Adam", "creator_id": 21843, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38399", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [21994]}, {"id": 67997, "acmi_id": "320852", "title": "George Bernard Shaw", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "george-bernard-shaw", "creator_credit": "Triangle Productions, Theodora Olembert and Jan Read", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Using newsreel interviews and conversation with such people as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Kingsley Martin the film presents the personality of Shaw, the social critic whose plays cast a brilliant light on the political ideas struggling for expression at the turn of the century.

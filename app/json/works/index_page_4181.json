Iren Zemann (Cecilia Esztergalyos) is a thirty something kindergarten teacher who is forced to move from her apartment when her elderly landlady dies. At the same time she is also mistress to Attila (Pal Hetenyi), a married man with children who has just told his wife Anna (Judit Pogany) about his affair with Iren. Attila, through his friend Hevesi, decides to find Iren a new apartment but all manner of complications ensue as Hevesi becomes involved in some rather underhanded dealings in securing Iren her new apartment, including a forced marriage in name only to Gabi (Janos Derzsi), a much younger single man, who would very much like to take advantage of his situation with Iren. An eventual meeting between Iren and Attila&#8217;s wife Anna provides a resulting ironic twist to the story. Set in 1970s Hungary, this is quite a poignant story reflecting the bleakness and the bureaucracy of the times.

In this dual-channel video, two separate scenes of the artist with a parent are juxtaposed. Chang faces her mother and, in the adjacent frame, appears face–to–face with her father. Simultaneously both images show the artist’s and respective parent’s faces pressed together in what at first appears to be a deep kiss. Gradually it becomes evident that the video is running in reverse time, and that they share not a kiss but rather an onion from which they both eat. They bite into it slowly, pausing as they take turns offering it to each other, as if it suggests the proverbial, forbidden fruit. Parent and child swallow before they take additional bites, blinking hard to hold back tears from the onion’s sharpness and pungency. However, in the video’s reversal of time, the onion is reconstituted and the tears disappear—wholeness is thus regained. Held in the collection at the Guggenheim.</p>\n<p>&#8216;In this video, I share eating an onion with my mother and my father.  The video is played backwards so that we begin in a kissing embrace with tears in our eyes.  As the video plays, the tears roll back up and an onion emerges from our mouths.  As the title suggests, the video is about the abstract boundaries of love, sacrifice, familial relations and inheritance.&#8217; Patty Chang</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 97, "name": "Time to rewind (The Gardens Between)", "description": "This constellation explores media works that manipulate time, specifically by utitlising a reverse play structure to tell a story."}], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>In Love (2001)</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "<p>A 2-channel video installation work that plays in reverse.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A 2-channel video installation work that plays in reverse.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Patty Chang</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["4:00"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 18}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 365, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/in-love-mom-1.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 876, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": null, "source_identifier": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [544]}, {"id": 94967, "acmi_id": "53025", "title": "In limbo", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-limbo", "creator_credit": "Dai Le, Jessica Douglas-Henry, SBS Independent and Iris Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In limbo follows the story of an Australian -Vietnamese lawyer who is determined to see 2000 Vietnamese boat people stranded in the Philippines regain the lives, identities and homes.

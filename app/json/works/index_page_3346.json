Ginsberg continues to write and to be active in radical politics including lending strong support to the peace movement. In the eighties he has concentrated on exploring Eastern philosophies and critiquing the consumerism of American society. The video includes interviews with Ginsberg&#8217;s step-mother, Timothy Leary and Joan Baez. The poet himself reads &#8220;Howl&#8221;, &#8220;Kaddish&#8221; and other poems straight to camera. Not only a documentary on Ginsberg and the Beats but a fascinating survey of the turbulent intellectual history of the United States over four decades.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hippies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Literature&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-", "Literature&nbsp;→ Kerouac, Jack, 1922-1969", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "People&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-", "People&nbsp;→ Ginsberg, Allen, 1926-", "People&nbsp;→ Kerouac, Jack, 1922-1969"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 868000, "name": "Jerry Aronson", "creator_id": 75159, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 867999, "name": "Jerry Aronson Film", "creator_id": 26271, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 867998, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40112", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [23661]}, {"id": 61377, "acmi_id": "xos-61377", "title": "The Life and Death of a Shadow 2015-16", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-life-and-death-of-a-shadow-2015-16", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "<p>Presented in Telling Tales: excursions in narrative form, 2016 (MCA)</p>", "headline_credit": "", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Exploration of the art of Wayang shadow play</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 138, "name": "Storytelling through shadow play", "description": "Shadow play has brought stories to life for thousands of years and is still used today."}], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Life and Death of a Shadow 2015-16</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "<p>Working between Sydney and Yogyakarta, Indonesian artist Jumaadi has created a new shadow puppet theatre especially for the exhibition.

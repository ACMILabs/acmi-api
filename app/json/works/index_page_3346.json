Liam Neeson stars as Doctor Peyton Westlake, a devoted partner to his soon to be wife (Frances McDormand) and a kindly scientist working on a synthetic skin that will revolutionise the process of skin grafting. There is only one draw back to the procedure; it melts after 99 minutes in the sun. One night there is an attack on Westlake&#8217;s laboratory and he is beaten, tortured and placed in a vat of acid. Against all odds Westlake survives, Doctors remove his neurons to alleviate the pain, and Westlake discovers he now has increased strength with a rage to match. Using this newfound energy, he escapes from the hospital to the remains of the lab, makes use of his synthetic skin, calls himself &#8220;Darkman&#8221; and vows to seek revenge.

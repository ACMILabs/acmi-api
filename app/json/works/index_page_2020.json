Klezmer musicians are born, not made, and this rich cultural tradition which originated in pre-World War II Poland and almost disappeared during the second World War because of the Holocaust and the Jewish migration out of Europe, has gone through a revival in America, particularly in New York. Leopold Kozlowski is one of the last remaining original klezmer musicians trained in the prewar tradition and through this documentary film, we journey with Leopold into his sometimes painful and tragic past to discover the inspiring and vibrant Jewish culture which he is so desperately trying to keep alive in Poland. Born in a small village near Lvov (Poland) called Przemyslany (now in the Ukraine) into a family of accomplished klezmorim - Leopold&#8217;s father was one of twelve brothers, all of whom were musicians - Leopold makes the return to his home and where his family were killed by the Gestapo. Here he visits his father&#8217;s grave, but also finds himself reunited with a friend he has not seen for fifty years. Leopold Kozlowski spent most of the war in concentration camps where his music became his inspiration for survival.

Spike Milligna, the well-known typing error, script-writer and voice of Eccles, Moriarty, Little Jim and Minnie Peter Sellers, alias Major Bloodnok, Bluebottle, and Henry Crun, practising his comeback by whistling a soliloquy from Hamlet. Harry Secombe, bald, toothless, Welsh and weighing 37 stone, the brains and the brawn behind Neddy Seagoon, dressed in a floral cretonne frock. The Goons take their final bow, in their last performance after 12 years of silence. From 1952-1960, The Goon Show spawned a cult of quickfire humour as radios&#8217; most influential clowns, driven by an inspired lunacy which wrenched conventional comedy into a new era.

As a result of the ongoing displacement of First Peoples, Amoonguna was established as a government reserve 21kms from Mparntwe (Alice Springs) in 1963. Known as town camps today, reserves like Amoonguna make up the Alice Springs Aboriginal housing associations. These town camps are home to many artists who are extremely proud of their communities. English is often the third language of Amoonguna residents with the major language groups being Arrernte (pronounced Arenda), Warlpiri and Pitjantjatjara.</p>\n<p>Mparntwe is a place where government policy and intervention in First Peoples communities has distinct and obvious implications. The Australian media often portrays this part of the nation negatively, without showing the historical narratives at play or the strength, beauty and talent that comes from the Central Desert. At the centre of the exhibition Two Girls From Amoonguna, is the animated video work Arrkutja Tharra, Kungka Kutjara, Two Girls, which reminds audiences that Mparntwe is filled with joy and laughter. From camping and travelling to town to finding bush tucker, this place is home.</p>\n<p>Tangentyere Artists and Yarrenyty Arltere Artists are akin to community hubs. Not only are they gallery and commercial spaces, but they are also places for young ones to learn and spaces for important community discussions.</p>\n<p>For Sally M Nangala Mulda (Arrernte and Southern Luritja) and Marlene Rubuntja (Arrernte and Western Arrarnta), their art centres reflect their artistic practices. The soft sculpture, sewing and bush dyeing seen in Marlene’s works are synonymous with Yarrenyty Arltere Artists. Tangentyere artists like Sally are renowned for figurative paintings, which are often autobiographical and depict scenes in and around Mparntwe. These centres provide culturally safe places for artists and community. With the success of both artists, they have become prominent figures in their communities and teach many young people within their kinship structure.

Two Girls From Amoonguna tells the intertwined story of Sally M Nangala Mulda and Marlene Rubuntja, from their childhood years to now as two of Australia’s leading artists, through paintings, sculptures and a newly commissioned animated video.</p>\n<p>The animation Arrkutja Tharra, Kunkga Kutjara, Two Girls was inspired by a conversation between Sally and Marlene, held on the steps of the Sydney Opera House, where they reminisced about their shared childhood at the Amoonguna settlement, outside of Mparntwe (Alice Springs), in the early 1960s. Figures from Marlene’s soft sculptures and Sally’s acrylic-on-linen paintings come to<br />\nlife, depicting life as they know it to create a portrait of two friends and the communities that made them.</p>\n<p>Arrkutja Tharra, Kungka Kutjara, Two Girls was made in collaboration with Ludo Studio, the Emmy-award winning production company behind Bluey, Robbie Hood and The Strange Chores.

As a result of the ongoing displacement of First Peoples, Amoonguna was established as a government reserve 21kms from Mparntwe (Alice Springs) in 1963. Known as town camps today, reserves like Amoonguna make up the Alice Springs Aboriginal housing associations. These town camps are home to many artists who are extremely proud of their communities. English is often the third language of Amoonguna residents with the major language groups being Arrernte (pronounced Arenda), Warlpiri and Pitjantjatjara.</p>\n<p>Mparntwe is a place where government policy and intervention in First Peoples communities has distinct and obvious implications. The Australian media often portrays this part of the nation negatively, without showing the historical narratives at play or the strength, beauty and talent that comes from the Central Desert. At the centre of the exhibition Two Girls From Amoonguna, is the animated video work Arrkutja Tharra, Kungka Kutjara, Two Girls, which reminds audiences that Mparntwe is filled with joy and laughter. From camping and travelling to town to finding bush tucker, this place is home.</p>\n<p>Tangentyere Artists and Yarrenyty Arltere Artists are akin to community hubs. Not only are they gallery and commercial spaces, but they are also places for young ones to learn and spaces for important community discussions.</p>\n<p>For Sally M Nangala Mulda (Arrernte and Southern Luritja) and Marlene Rubuntja (Arrernte and Western Arrarnta), their art centres reflect their artistic practices. The soft sculpture, sewing and bush dyeing seen in Marlene’s works are synonymous with Yarrenyty Arltere Artists. Tangentyere artists like Sally are renowned for figurative paintings, which are often autobiographical and depict scenes in and around Mparntwe.

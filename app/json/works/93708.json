The story begins with the birth of Mewtwo, a bio-engineered Pokemon created from the DNA of Mew, the rarest of all Pokemon. On discovering that he has been created for reseach purposes, Mewtwo becomes angry, breaking out of captivity. His mission is to eliminate all Pokemon and humans and let super clones rule the world. It is up to Ash Ketchum to save Earth, along with his human and Pokemon friends, including Pikachu. A battle like never before takes place, with original Pokemon fighting super clone Pokemon, Mewtwo fighting Mew, and Ash valiantly trying to put an end to the fighting. Themes such as friendship, loyalty, and non-violence are expounded and yet visually in terms of the fighting, the opposite takes place until near the very end of the story. Created by Satoshi Tajiri, written by Takeshi Shudo, with English adaptation directed by Michael Haigney. Dubbed in English.

Dr Hess Green, an esteemed anthropologist, is assigned a new assistant of unstable disposition, George Meda. When Hess is stabbed with an African relic, he becomes obsessed with blood, being possessed by an ancient curse. Hess infects his wife, Ganja, granting them both eternal life. With an elliptical structure the film is imbued with a dreamlike quality that is frequently menacing but never predictable. This blaxploitation work is considered iconic by many modern American filmmakers, including Spike Lee. At 110 minutes, this version is the restored director&#8217;s cut. Cast includes Marlene Clark and Duane Jones. Also known as Double Possession, Blood Couple, and Black Vampire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Blaxploitation films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African American women", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African American women", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ African American women", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ African American women", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Allegory", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964281, "name": "Kelly-Jordan Enterprises", "creator_id": 36645, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964282, "name": "Chris Schultz", "creator_id": 36646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964283, "name": "Bill Gunn", "creator_id": 36647, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52552", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [34085]}, {"id": 92348, "acmi_id": "315597", "title": "Gangster no. 1", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gangster-no-1", "creator_credit": "FilmFour, Pagoda Productions, Norma Heyman, Jonathan Cavendish and Paul McGuigan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Told mainly in flashback, &#8220;Gangster No.1&#8221; chronicles the bloody rise and unceremonious fall of the oddly named Gangster 55 (Malcolm McDowell/Paul Bettany).

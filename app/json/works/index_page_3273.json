Though the violence in the film is extreme, &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; is a highly satirical commentary on machismo and masculine insecurity. On its release &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; was severely criticised for its elusive and contradictory politics; but contradiction is the essence of the society that the film examines. So this is a virulently anti-Capitalist movie financed by one of the world&#8217;s largest media multinationals; this is a feminist film that exalts in masculine aggression; this is a film that postulates that materialism has gone too far while utilising every state-of-the-art digital special effect available. It is always, however, exhilarating and provocative. Cast includes Meat Loaf, Jared Leto and Helena Bonham Carter (terrific as Jack&#8217;s resilient chain-smoking s ometimes-girlfriend, Marla).

Jack&#8217;s life is turned upside down when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to the &#8220;fight club&#8221;, a secret society of men who meet in underground clubs to beat the pulp out of each other.

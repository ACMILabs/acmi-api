With a loyal gang and always two steps ahead of the law, Michael plans numerous heists, such as a daylight robbery of a precious Caravaggio, along with pulling ordinary bank jobs and robbing his own dole office. Michael&#8217;s unusual home life consists of two partners, who are sisters, and numerous children, a delightful arrangement for one and all. Enraged by Michael&#8217;s elusiveness and brazen disregard for authority, the police place him and his lot under unyielding surveillance, but the scallywag gives them the slip every time. &#8220;Ordinary decent criminal&#8221; is a reworking of the true to life Martin Cahill story as told in &#8220;The General&#8221; (John Boorman, 1998), a far more cynical film about crime. O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s film has a certain incongruity in tone - it is mostly jaunty with a hip soundtrack, but occasionally cuts to violent encounters.

Broadhurst was brutally murdered on 15 October 1977 at her Paddington premises; and the killer has never been identified. Broadhurst was renowned for her flamboyant clothes, antique jewellery and coiffed, hennaed hair. &#8220;Unfolding Florence&#8221; explores her life in a vibrant and unconventional style, with more than a touch of humour and irreverence; a fitting approach to this unusual woman&#8217;s story. Cast includes Judi Farr (as Florence) and Felicity Price (as the young Florence).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Designers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Interior design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Textile design", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interior design", "People&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 975885, "name": "Katherine Thomson", "creator_id": 81376, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975884, "name": "Gillian Armstrong", "creator_id": 214, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975883, "name": "Charles Hannah", "creator_id": 81375, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975882, "name": "Sue Clothier", "creator_id": 30348, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975881, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975880, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975879, "name": "Becker Entertainment", "creator_id": 81374, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 975878, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 975890, "name": "Felicity Price", "creator_id": 81381, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 975889, "name": "Judi Farr", "creator_id": 81380, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 975888, "name": "Paul Grabowsky", "creator_id": 81379, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 975887, "name": "John Radel", "creator_id": 81378, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 975886, "name": "Nicholas Beauman", "creator_id": 81377, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 975877, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 15653, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/319767_UnfoldingFlorence.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Unfolding Florence: the many lives of Florence Broadhurst (Gillian Armstrong) still", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 438, "height": 327, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

Nick Nolte plays Jack Benteen, a Texas Ranger with an incendiary attitude (that apes Dirty Harry), driven by the lawlessness and brutality that has invaded his hometown since the drug trade has escalated there. Heading a key operation is former friend, Cash Bailey; Cash and Benteen are in love with the same sexy Mexican woman, currently Benteen&#8217;s girlfriend, which incenses their conflict. Benteen&#8217;s success in disarming his former friend is limited and he is countered by a crack team of mercenaries, all ex-army and officially dead or missing, who have been engaged to eliminate Cash and his merciless crew. The bloodshed in this film is quite relentless, lots of bullet-riddled bodies and big guns, interspersed with numerous high tech crimes.

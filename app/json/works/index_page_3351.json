A fatal car accident has caused the reverend to prohibit music, because of the corruptive influence it has over teenagers. His daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is opposed to her father&#8217;s views and is drawn to Ren because of his life in another place where music isn&#8217;t banned, and for the possibility that he could take her away from Bomont.

The most notable black heroes are Sylvester (Don Cheadle), a music teacher and Mann (Ving Rhames), a stranger on horseback who becomes the focus of white hatred and black resistance. The adulterous town grocer John Wright (Jon Voight), one of the few white residents, also plays a key role in saving lives, but before he does, he must resolve painful racial issues and make a difficult personal choice.

Memo is a journal-like collection of imagery, text and observations that looks at the permeation of the mediascape, technology and popular culture with the everyday. Intrigued by how this convergence shapes and influence what we perceive as self, experience, memory and identity I have examined and re-presented visual and verbal material derived from daily life-sounds, samples, imagery, text and language.<br />\nA subtle and very beautiful piece of interactive design and visual patina. Selected for exhibition at MILIA&#8217;s &#8220;New Talent Pavilion&#8221; 2001, Cannes, France.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation&nbsp;→ 2-D computer animation"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2711534, "name": "Matthew Riley", "creator_id": 9279, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2711535, "name": "David Atkinson", "creator_id": 6531, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2711536, "name": "Jeremy Parker", "creator_id": 6612, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2711537, "name": "Animation and Interactive Media (AIM) RMIT", "creator_id": 6535, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production facilities", "role_id": 442, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "CD ROM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2738", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 337, "name": "Victoria, Australia", "slug": "victoria-australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [48739]}, {"id": 109245, "acmi_id": "B1006118", "title": "The Effects of fire", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-effects-of-fire", "creator_credit": "Amiel Courtin-Wilson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 10 OCT 2003-30 NOV 2003", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This proposed public imaging piece shows a series of close up portraits of domestic objects being burnt to abstraction, creating an inventory of domestic combustion in this piece.

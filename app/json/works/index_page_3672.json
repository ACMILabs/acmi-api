Tormented by guilt, he becomes a Reverend upon his return home. However, his efforts remain in vain and he is unable to guide others when he continues to feel engulfed by grief and hopelessness. Hess&#8217;s only way to reconcile the past is to face the horror of war once again. Within the first scene of &#8220;Battle hymn&#8221;, Dean Hess, played superbly by Rock Hudson, decides to return to war. It is 1950 and the Korean War has just begun; Hess heads a training camp in South Korea, and is once again amidst the drama of war, forging ties with the &#8216;locals&#8217;, facing the act of killing, helping his buddies deal with the war and so on. When loads of young Korean children appear at the training base, Hess, along with a Korean woman, En Soon Yang (Anna Kashfi), establish an orphanage using US navy equipment and food. Through key events, Hess learns to overcome the past: he witnesses his colleagues learning to deal with the act of killing, he encounters an old Korean sage, he forges a poignant relationship with Yang, and he gives the children he saves hope and, above all, a future. Sirk is known for his expressive melodramas that transpire in an urban setting. However, in &#8220;Battle hymn&#8221;, he takes melodrama to the battlefield and achieves a fine, poignant, and well-crafted war film.

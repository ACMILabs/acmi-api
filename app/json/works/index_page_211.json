Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 14 contains footage of the royal tour visiting Warragul and the Latrobe Valley, followed by a visit to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 14:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Warragul&#8221;, followed by footage of Queen and Duke exiting railway station (?) and at 00:00:20:00 entering car. 00:00:30:00 flag-waving crowd of children, Queen and Duke mounting dais and waving to crowd. 00:00:43:00 Queen making speech. 00:00:55:00 child presents flowers. 00:01:09:00 locals presented. 00:01:38:00 footage is of crowd along tracks from moving train. 00:01:45:00 footage is of train itself moving along tracks and a distance shot as train moves through very flat grasslands. 00:02:04:00 Title &#8220;Visit of His Royal Highness to the University of Melbourne&#8221;, followed by very brief footage of flag flying over (presumably) a Melbourne University building. 00:02:17:00 Title &#8220;Visit of His Royal Highness to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research&#8221;, followed by shots of the Institute buildings at Royal Melbourne Hospital. 00:03:12:00 the Duke arrives in open car, and greets waiting crowd and children before entering building, where we see some Institute equipment and staff at work.

Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>In Reel 11, we see the Queen dedicating the forecourt and eternal flame additions to Melbourne&#8217;s Shrine of Remembrance. The Queen and other audience are seen arriving at Melbourne&#8217;s Princess Theatre. The Duke visits the Flinders Naval Depot (now HMAS Cerberus).</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 11:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Shrine of Remembrance Dedication of Additions&#8221;, followed by aerial shots of Shrine of Remembrance with waiting crowds, and Queen&#8217;s car driving along St. Kilda Road. 00:00:35:00 car arrives at the Shrine, driving slowly through waving crowds. 00:00:41:00 Queen and Duke exit their car and are greeted (by an official party including Governor Brooks). 00:01:00:00 the party walk across the Shrine forecourt with Government House and Melbourne Observatory buildings visible in the background. Party climb steps and enter Shrine; at 00:01:34:00 an entertaining shot of a collective bow and curtsey at top of Shrine steps. The National Anthem is played and speeches made (NOTE: this footage does NOT include footage of Queen lighting Eternal Flame contained in Reel 1). There is a break in the film before a shot of the Eternal Flame smoking. Official party walk down steps and across the forecourt to the Eternal Flame. 00:03:18:00 Queen and Duke re-enter car and leave. 00:03:38:0 Title &#8220;Arrival at Princess Theatre Monday, 1st.

"brief_description": "<p>The 1954 visit to Australia of newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne.

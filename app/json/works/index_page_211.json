In French with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Lucien Lacombe (Pierre Blaise) is a young peasant trying to make ends meet in Nazi-occupied France. Bored with his job cleaning in a country hospital, he first tries joining the Resistance, then the Gestapo, in his search for excitement and to earn some extra cash. He puts his own success as a collaborator at risk, however, when he finds himself falling in love with, and then exploiting, the daughter of a Jewish tailor (Aurore Clement). Using an almost detached camera, Louis Malle&#8217;s controversial film is a verite-style drama of corruption, apathy and amorality. Young Lucien&#8217;s succumbing to the allure and promises of the Nazis&#8217; is not an isolated act but a response to the casual war profiteering, prostitution and opportunism that he sees the adults around him engaging in. What is truly shocking is the ease with which people are shown becoming accustomed to the most vile and extreme acts of torture and genocide. Malle&#8217;s discreet and circumspect mise-en-scene resists manipulating the viewer through sensationalism or moral self-righteousness; Lucien&#8217;s descent is all too identifiably human.

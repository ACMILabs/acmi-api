The Tracker (David Gulpilil) is a First Nations policeman during a time in which trackers were employed to find suspects. He answers to The Fanatic (Gary Sweet), a cruel bigot who is hell bent on catching The Fugitive, a First Nations man accused of murdering a white woman. The Follower (Damon Gameau), is a naive young colonial policeman new to the job while The Veteran (Grant Page) is a world weary man whose kind nature is overridden by what he must do and how society expects him to treat First Nations people. The three white men are ultimately dependent on the silent, ever watchful tracker. When an interrogation turns into a massacre, the balance of power shifts and assumed notions of truth and justice are thrown into question. While the film tackles the brutal treatment of First Nations people by white police, De Heer avoids a realist portrayal of graphic violence by cutting to paintings (by South Australian artist, Peter Coad) that represent the scenes of brutality and bloodshed. With its sparse use of dialogue, much of the film&#8217;s thematic content - about the displacement of First Nations peoples by white settlers, and the conflict between different systems of justice - is conveyed through songs written by Graham Tardif and performed for the film by Archie Roach.

The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddenly there is a change - a way out for a &#8216;lucky&#8217; four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town.

Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp), also known as Joe the Jeweller, befriends Mafia small man and former assassin Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino). Lefty sees in the young Donnie a chance to rise in the Mafia ranks, something the aging Lefty, with his drug addicted son and passive wife is no longer capable of. Unbeknown to Lefty, Donnie Brasco is an under cover special agent, working with the FBI to infiltrate the New York Mafia underworld. What at first seems a simple case of undercover work is complicated by Donnie&#8217;s genuine feelings of friendship towards Lefty and Lefty&#8217;s loyalty towards Donnie. Based on the book by Joseph D. Pistone with Richard Woodley.

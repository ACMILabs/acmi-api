The transitions from one book cover to another intensify the viewer&#8217;s awareness of the power of the gaze. The heroine pivots and turns, knowing she is watched by the predator male (always lurking behind her), as she also seduces the paperback consumer. The viewer&#8217;s gaze is held captive as she beckons, sashaying from left to right, right to left, with every gesture emphasising the formulaic signifiers of beauty: the button nose, the downcast eyes, and the lips - poised, pensive, tremulous, waiting.</p>\n<p>Always the waiting. This &#8216;waiting&#8217; is the basic form - the topic requiring a morphology - of romantic desire. The lover waits for the return of a half-hallucinated, half-remembered state when all existence seemed to be suffused in unconditional devotion and satisfaction. Perhaps this perfect state is remembered from infancy or from an interlude before a crushing betrayal or disappointment, when bliss seemed real and within reach. Anyone with the slightest romantic inclination (and isn&#8217;t that just about everyone?) is forever lured on by this fantasy that feels like a neverending quest to capture a memory.</p>\n<p>Robert Arnold completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture at the University of Illinois in 1977, and attained his Master of Arts in Sculpture at the University of Iowa in 1980. It was then that he began his foray into experimental films and videos, and ever since he has combined an academic career with experimental work.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["PG", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815659, "name": "Robert Arnold", "creator_id": 73333, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1786060, "name": "Robert Arnold", "creator_id": 73333, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1786059, "name": "Robert Arnold", "creator_id": 73333, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1786062, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 108198, "acmi_id": "B2001051", "title": "Robert Arnold compilation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "robert-arnold-compilation", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "1998-2000", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 108197, "acmi_id": "B1001844", "title": "Triptych", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "triptych", "creator_credit": "Robert Arnold", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Poland and United States, 1999-2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Screen Gallery", "last_on_display_date": "2003-08-31", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "410", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [47692], "external_references": []}, {"id": 108022, "acmi_id": "B1001086", "title": "Trepang", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "trepang", "creator_credit": "Andrish Saint-Clare", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Every wet season between the early 1600s and 1906, when the Australian government outlawed the practice, Macassan sailors from Indonesia would sail to Arnhem Land to collect and harvest the sea slug or &#8216;trepang&#8217;.

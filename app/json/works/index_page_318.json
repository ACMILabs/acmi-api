A critical analysis of Sydney and the initial lack of city planning. Despite the surrounding beauty and the opportunity for wise planning, Sydney became a crowded and poorly serviced city. Many houses were built on narrow, cramped and dimly lit streets which contributed to the escalation of crime and disease. Those responsible for constructing roadways rarely considered the impact on residents. Many schools and shopping centres were built on major thoroughfares resulting in a high rate of school children and housewives being killed by cars. Considering the harbourside location, many of the views became obstructed by buildings housing the privileged. The &#8216;Town and Country Planning Act of 1945&#8217; was introduced to provide an opportunity to remedy the mistakes of the past by planning for future improvements.

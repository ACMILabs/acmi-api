Finally, &#8216;In a cup of Tea&#8217;s&#8216; grimly surreal coda of a publisher&#8217;s frustration with the inconclusiveness of many Japanese ghost stories, aptly completes this remarkable anthology. Kobayashi&#8217;s meticulous direction, (Kobayashi&#8217;s obsessive aesthetic control drove him to hand paint all the sets himself) along with the unsettling soundtrack by Toru Takemitsu make this a unique film experience. In Japanese with English subtitles.

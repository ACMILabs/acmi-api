The thief, Ismael (Karra Elejalde) is interrupted during a robbery when the woman of the house unexpectedly returns. Without any hesitation, Ismael proceeds to cold-bloodedly kill the woman and only as he makes his escape does he realise that the murder has been silently witnessed by the woman&#8217;s young daughter, Leire. Many years later Leire (Ana Alvarez) and Ismael&#8217;s paths cross. Terrified that he may be exposed by the truth, Ismael decides to kidnap Leire and hold her prisoner in his derelict squat, much to his girlfriend Maite&#8217;s (Lio) annoyance and frustration. Leire, however, having been traumatised by the witnessing of her mother&#8217;s murder, has grown up as a mute. As Ismael&#8217;s interest in Liere turns from fear to an almost obsessive attraction, Liere unwittingly finds herself becoming part of a complex and dangerous love triangle, which can only lead to a twisted and violent conclusion, particularly in light of Maite&#8217;s extreme jealousy towards Leire. A film of suspense and intrigue peppered with moments of dark humour and acted by a superb cast including Silvia Marso, Elena Irureta, Ramon Barea. Winner of many international film festival awards (Montreal, Stockholm, Sao Paulo etc) including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress (Ana Alvarez) and Best Actor (Karra Elejalde).

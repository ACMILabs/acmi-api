Ada McGrath (Hunter) can hear and communicates in sign language through her young daughter, Fiona (Anna Paquin), but she can&#8217;t talk. Apart from her child, Ada&#8217;s most treasured possession is her piano. She marries a man she&#8217;s never met, a pioneer settler (Sam Neill) in New Zealand. The marriage starts badly when Neill refuses to transport Ada&#8217;s piano to his settlement. Later, he allows George Baines (Keitel), who has &#8216;gone native&#8217; to have the piano.

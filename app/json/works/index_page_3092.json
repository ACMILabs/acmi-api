But Lucy&#8217;s passion comes at a cost: life on the fringe, the dangers of drugs, and the continual question of where the rent money is going to come from. The final moments of this film, in which Syd faces what is really of value in the world of &#8220;high art&#8221;, are shattering. Music by Shudder to Think. Sheedy and Mitchell are outstanding.

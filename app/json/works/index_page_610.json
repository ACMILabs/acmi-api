With the commencement of season four, this has ominously changed to &#8216;everything dies.&#8217; This foreboding phrase, spoken by the murderous alien bounty hunter that Mulder and Scully were pursuing at the end of season three, resonates throughout the fourth season. The uneasy sense of darker things to come commences in episode one (Ep. 1 &#8216;Herrenvolk&#8217;) with Mulder&#8217;s mother still in a life threatening coma and the murder of the agent&#8217;s government informant; the mysterious X. The dread soon begins to accumulate with the return of Krycek and the parasitic alien black oil (Ep. 9 &#8216;Tunguska&#8217;). However, the biggest shock the season has in store is Scully discovering she has cancer that might also be related to her abduction (Ep. 15 &#8216;Memento Mori&#8217;). Season four saw the show at the height of its popularity with its biggest US ratings so far, even surpassing die hard fans&#8217; expectations with some of the most creepiest episodes of the series (Ep. 3 &#8216;Home&#8217; ; Ep. 2 &#8216;Unruhe&#8217; ; Ep. 4 &#8216;Teliko&#8217; ; Ep. 14 &#8216;Leonard Betts&#8217;) and its most compelling (Ep. 15 &#8216;Memento Mori&#8217; ; Ep. 13 &#8216;Never again&#8217; ; Ep. 24 &#8216;Gethsemane&#8217;).

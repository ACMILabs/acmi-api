This was the third collaboration between Jack Nicholson and Roger Corman (Little shop of horrors, The Raven), the first with Nicholson in the lead role and features the usual Corman tenets of a busty female lead, skeletons in the closet and cut price special effects. A touch of &#8220;The Birds&#8221; is evident, with birds circling ominously and providing a tangible link between the witch and her puppet Helene. Cast includes: Sandra Knight, Richard Miller, Dorothy Neumann.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 928801, "name": "Filmgroup", "creator_id": 22138, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928802, "name": "Roger Corman", "creator_id": 76748, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q318292", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 928800, "name": "MRA Entertainment", "creator_id": 80709, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52160", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [33779], "external_references": [{"id": 1359, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1968139"}]}, {"id": 73627, "acmi_id": "010731", "title": "The Terrible twos and the trusting threes [Colour version]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-terrible-twos-and-the-trusting-threes-colour-version", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB and Judith Crawley", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1950", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A study of child behavior at two and three years, showing what to expect and how parents can deal constructively with the problems they present.

Considering the controversial nature of Bret Easton Ellis&#8217;s novel, director Mary Harron and co-script writer Guinevere Turner have transliterated the work with remarkable wit and insight. The film maintains the ambiguous balance between what may be a horrific reality or an elaborate fantasy of a desperately lost soul. Cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Bulgarian", "Czech", "English", "English", "English", "Hungarian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Materialism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959894, "name": "Columbia Tristar", "creator_id": 32918, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959895, "name": "Edward Pressman", "creator_id": 23171, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959896, "name": "Mary Harron", "creator_id": 10194, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 959893, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48810", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [30936]}, {"id": 64716, "acmi_id": "000330", "title": "American music: from folk to jazz and pop", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "american-music-from-folk-to-jazz-and-pop", "creator_credit": "McGraw-Hill Films, Stephen Fleischman and Jonathan Donald", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Looks at the &#8220;musical explosion&#8221; by tracing the roots of popular music or jazz in American history.

Mark&#8217;s big dream, however, is to be an American filmmaker. A horror film buff, he has been making no-budget gore flicks on 8mm since an early age, all of which starred his friends and some of which include sequels that run up to the fourth instalment.

The gap between Mark&#8217;s suburban reality and his dream is all too obvious, and the filmmakers milk a lot of laughs from his &#8216;loser&#8217; existence: his drugged out friend, Mike; his relationship with Uncle Bill, a senile old man from whom he derives financing; his home life; his eccentric personality; the &#8216;nobodies&#8217; who help him on his film and so on. But the documentary also shows a great deal of compassion for Mark and recognition of both his earnestness to make films and the many hurdles and obstacles this dream involves.

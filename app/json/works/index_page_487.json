She learned the piano and studied music at school, attending the University of Melbourne Conservatorium where she graduated with a Bachelor of Music in 1930. Alice Moyle&#8217;s first experience of Aboriginal music was listening to recordings made by Professor Elkin when she was attending courses at the Faculty of Music at Sydney University. These recordings were to prepare teachers for work in the outback. In 1959 Alice made the first of many field trips into the outback to continue the process of recording and archiving Aboriginal music. She has continually tried to inspire others with her experiences and knowledge in Aboriginal music and culture and is adamant that music be included as an essential component in the study of Aboriginal culture.

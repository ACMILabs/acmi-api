She is happy at first and has brought  all kinds of toys from Europe, but gradually mum finds herself upset by the myriad little differences that have accumulated since she went away. One day, Chenchen and his pappi return home to find all his toys thrown out on the lawn. When they opend the door they find the entire place reorganised. &#8220;Have we entered the wrong house?&#8221; asks Chenchen. Mum is on a mission to re-habituate, and in the process has accidentally dropped her son&#8217;s pet guinea pigs off the balcony and killed them. Chenchen is distraught. He buries them and curses his mother, telling her that grandpa was a better mother than she.</p>\n<p>When mother prepares pizza for dinner Chen Chen brings out the guinea pig cage as always, only this time it is empty. He then goes about breaking up pieces of bread to put in the cage bowl, urging the invisible pet to eat up.</p>\n<p>Chen chen continues to experience difficulties in adjusting to his mother, but grandfather realises his dilemma, that he needs to leave in order to avoid the two of them becoming too reliant upon each other. He decides to go. When he asks his mother where grandpa went Chenchen accuses her of driving him away. He tears up the place and runs off to find his grandfather and, bursting into tears, pounds against his door. Later the two celebrate grandpa&#8217;s birthday by going out and flying kites. His daughter bakes him a huge delicious cake, and when she has come back out with a blanket for him she realises he&#8217;s dead.</p>\n<p>She does not tell Chen Chen and they celebrate his birthday with the lighting of hundreds of red candles which fill the room. This cinematic gesture of the red candles was extremely interesting from the point of view of a maternal force using deception in order to joyfully memorialise a powerful bygone influence. Above the red candles is a classic Communist Era family photo portrait of their grandpa and grandmother. This is in some respects a symbolic gesture to say that with the passing of the grandpa&#8217;s generation is the passing of that chapter of China&#8217;s history and a step toward an embrace of the new.</p>\n<p>The film is quite slow.<br />\n(1 star - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:28:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grandparents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Parenthood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Parenting", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889807, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889808, "name": "Wang Junzheng", "creator_id": 82433, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889809, "name": "He Guofu", "creator_id": 82434, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889810, "name": "Yan Junsheng", "creator_id": 82435, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889811, "name": "Liu Fang", "creator_id": 82436, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889812, "name": "Shi Chen", "creator_id": 82437, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889813, "name": "Li Ding", "creator_id": 82438, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889814, "name": "Xiao Xiong", "creator_id": 82439, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889815, "name": "Zhang Qianyi", "creator_id": 82440, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146415", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [55263], "external_references": []}, {"id": 109392, "acmi_id": "B1006491", "title": "A Letter for Marie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-letter-for-marie", "creator_credit": "Tom Valenta", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2003", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>South African born Marie has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.

Between 1950 and 1980 a huge range of quality films were produced with many gaining top awards at various film festivals. This is a compilation of a selection of four films, digitally remastered by the British Film Institute, demonstrating the diversity and high calibre of BTF as a production company. Elizabethan express: From King&#8217;s Cross Station, London, to Waverley Station, Edinburgh, is 393 miles. The Elizabethan - a summertime express - does this journey in six and a half hours non-stop - the longest daily non-stop run in the world to be timed at over 60 mph in 1954. This film is about one of those runs and the people behind the service. (See also Title Code 003232 16mm) Snowdrift at Bleath Gill: A freight train becomes snowbound in the West-Morland hills in Northern England. The Motive Power, Operating and Engineering Departments of British Transport go to work with snow-ploughs to reach the trapped train. Working through the night the team dig clear, and thaw out moving parts, and finally two engines help to clear the line.

This is a compilation of a selection of four films, digitally remastered by the British Film Institute, demonstrating the diversity and high calibre of BTF as a production company. Elizabethan express: From King&#8217;s Cross Station, London, to Waverley Station, Edinburgh, is 393 miles. The Elizabethan - a summertime express - does this journey in six and a half hours non-stop - the longest daily non-stop run in the world to be timed at over 60 mph in 1954. This film is about one of those runs and the people behind the service. (See also Title Code 003232 16mm) Snowdrift at Bleath Gill: A freight train becomes snowbound in the West-Morland hills in Northern England. The Motive Power, Operating and Engineering Departments of British Transport go to work with snow-ploughs to reach the trapped train. Working through the night the team dig clear, and thaw out moving parts, and finally two engines help to clear the line.

Scenes are filmed on the piers and from the piers, capturing all the activity. There are lovely scenes of yachts sailing, people watching boat races, adults and children fishing and dockside workers undertaking their jobs on the piers.</p>\n<p>The film also contains wonderful scenes of the celebration parade for the &#8216;Centenary of Essendon Municipal Government&#8217; from 1961.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 a large ship<br />\n00:00:20:00 yachts on the bay with a pier in the foreground<br />\n00:01:03:00 a large 3-sail yacht tacking in the bay<br />\n00:01:19:00 a fishing rod in the foreground<br />\n00:01:20:00 children and adults fishing off the pier<br />\n00:01:28:00 men working with a tractor and pulley on the pier<br />\n00:02:02:00 pulleys being operated to take up large chains and an anchor on a pier<br />\n00:02:57:00 closer up to some yachts<br />\n00:02:05:00 motor boats on the bay<br />\n00:03:50:00 large yacht and passengers close up<br />\n00:04:07:00 a military ship<br />\n00:04:26:00 yachts racing on the bay<br />\n00:04:42:00 an older man, wearing a classic 1940s – 1950s style hat, standing on the pier looking out across the bay<br />\n00:05:00:00 a boy wearing rolled up trousers, fishing off the pier and more lovely yachts sailing by before we see a man and another boy who is lying down on the pier alongside his fishing rod<br />\n00:05:34:00 a motor boat goes by<br />\n00:05:42:00 a young man rowing a small rowboat<br />\n00:06:12:00 women wearing wide floral skirts, sitting on beach chairs on the pier, boys fishing and a bicycle<br />\n00:06:19:00 a tugboats travels past the pier<br />\n00:06:25:00 small cars on the pier<br />\n00:06:46:00 a large ship sails into the bay<br />\n00:06:55:00 two young boys collect a wicker fishing basket and rods<br />\n00:07:24:00 large passenger ship sails close by the end of the pier where some small cars are parked<br />\n00:07:40:00 seagulls flying by<br />\n00:07:46:00 program for the ‘Centenary of Municipal Government in Essendon 1861 – 1961, official Centennial Celebration program.

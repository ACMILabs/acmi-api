Berlin was blockaded and threatened with starvation by Stalin - the West&#8217;s response was the Berlin airlift. Meanwhile, to keep up with America&#8217;s nuclear capabilities the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb on 29 August 1949.

The film is structured around the recollections and self-justification of four men involved in the massacre as they await trial in 1946. Stark black and white photography conveys an atmosphere of coldness and remoteness, visually linking the emotional detachment and denials of the perpetrators with stark images of the massacre itself.

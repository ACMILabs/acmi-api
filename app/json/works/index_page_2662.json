Features frequent musical interludes and the voices of Jeff Bennett, Rob Paulsen, Aria Noelle Curzon, Thomas Dekker, Robert Guillaume, Susan Krebs and Kenneth Mars.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dinosaurs", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Prehistoric life", "Motion picture sequels", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2358239, "name": "Charles Grosvenor", "creator_id": 27508, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5078465", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2358236, "name": "Universal Studios", "creator_id": 23708, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2358233, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51648", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33365]}, {"id": 88669, "acmi_id": "311265", "title": "The Lady from Grey County", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-lady-from-grey-county", "creator_credit": "Janice H Brown, Margaret Wescott and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1977", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>On March 8, 1922, Agnes Campbell Macphail became Canada&#8217;s first woman Member of Parliament.

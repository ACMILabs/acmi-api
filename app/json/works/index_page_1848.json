As they begin to sweep up the remains of the dinner the father stops them in a moment of brilliant irony:</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t clean it.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Why?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sweeping out all our fortune with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(This is a reference to a tradition of the Spring Festival where it is a taboo to throw anything out or clean anything for fear of sweeping out the good luck to be invested in the coming year).</p>\n<p>The ending of this movie is superb, with both Grandma and Grandpa high-tailing it on a sleigh, ploughing through the snow to Shenyan&#8217;s Imperial Palace, leaving the family to deal with the aftermath and inherit their &#8220;fortune&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While the film is left open ended in its conclusions, the moral seems to be that, just like every generation, the youth place constant demands on their parents until they themselves become old and realise that the only &#8220;fortune&#8221; one can gain in life is through taking responsibility for one&#8217;s own life.<br />\nDing Jiali is a famous Chinese actress, also starring in the collection&#8217;s film &#8220;Fatherless Village&#8221;.<br />\n(4 stars - James Donald;

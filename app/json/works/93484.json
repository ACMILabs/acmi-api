American minimalist composer John Adams represents the Christmas story, in light of the dawn of a new millennium, by interpreting the story described and prophesied in the New Testament of the Bible, as translated by American Richard Latimore. Adams has fragmented this text, added Old English and utilised the Apocrypha, while focusing on the work of female Latin American poets. Adams&#8217; desire is to depict the birth of Christ simultaneously from several different, largely female, points of view.

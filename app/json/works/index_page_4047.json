In these five documentaries Christo and his wife&#8217;s work habits are laid bare including their ambitions and conflicts with bureaucrats which constitute a significant portion of their work. Works include: &#8220;Christos Valley Curtain&#8221; Academy Award nominated film that celebrates the hanging of a huge orange curtain between two Colorado mountains. &#8220;Running Fence&#8221; An engrossing document of the efforts to build a 24 and 1/2 mile long, 18 foot high fence of white fabric across the hills of Northern California. &#8220;Islands&#8221; Christo and Jean-Claude fight to surround eleven islands in Miami&#8217;s Biscayne Bay with 6.5 million square feet of bright pink fabric. &#8220;Christo in Paris&#8221; The wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris and a portrait of the artists lasting love affair. &#8220;Umbrellas&#8221; Thousands of umbrellas are simultaneously opened in rice-farming valley in Japan and across a cluster of cattle ranches in southern California. This is great collection about an iconic artist at work that is accompanied by fascinating commentaries, a glossy booklet and an extensive interview with the artists.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["04:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, European", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 20th century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artistic collaboration", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Christo, 1935-", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Conceptual art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Plaster sculpture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Public art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Sculpture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Sculpture, Modern", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Sculpture, Modern - 20th century - History", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Women artists", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Creative ability", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Creative thinking", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Christo, 1935-", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1766340, "name": "Grahame Weinbren", "creator_id": 81107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766339, "name": "Susan Froemke", "creator_id": 76714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766338, "name": "Deborah Dickson", "creator_id": 81106, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766337, "name": "Charlotte Zwerin", "creator_id": 65442, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766336, "name": "Ellen Hovde", "creator_id": 65384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766335, "name": "David Maysles", "creator_id": 65388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766334, "name": "Albert Maysles", "creator_id": 65387, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766333, "name": "Maysles Films, Inc.", "creator_id": 31997, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1766332, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53047", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [34495], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90317, "acmi_id": "313265", "title": "5 colours of France = Five colours of France", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "5-colours-of-france-five-colours-of-france", "creator_credit": "TV Color Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1970", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Cinemagazine items:  1.

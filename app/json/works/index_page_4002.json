This film is based on an original story by Masamune Shirow, who published the first book in the Appleseed series &#8220;The Promethean Challenge&#8221;, in 1985. In 1986, the Appleseed books won him the Galaxy Award for the best sci-fi manga. In general, Shirow&#8217;s inspiration derives from reading extensively, particularly in the areas of science, medicine, the supernatural, military strategy, biology, nanotechnology, and mythology, which is particularly apparent in Appleseed.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:08:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Manga", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Manga", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Literature&nbsp;→ Japanese literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Cyborgs", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959562, "name": "Manga Entertainment", "creator_id": 27485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959563, "name": "Taro Maki", "creator_id": 79460, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959564, "name": "Atsushi Sugita", "creator_id": 79461, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959565, "name": "Masaki Sawanobori", "creator_id": 77984, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959566, "name": "Kazuyoshi Katayama", "creator_id": 32579, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 959561, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48290", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [30460], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95825, "acmi_id": "325483", "title": "Apples in Tasmania", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "apples-in-tasmania", "creator_credit": "Cine Austral Productions and Fred Whatham", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1963", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Traces the development and locations of the apple-growing industry in Tasmania.

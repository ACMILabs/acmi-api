They have their thermos flask, sandwiches, and cordial.</p>\n<p>The film shows people being towed uphill and past a building with “ski lodge” signage.</p>\n<p>There are various scenes of skiers congregating together on the slopes and wide shots of them skiing in across and down the slopes.</p>\n<p>The final part of the film shows what could be accommodation Bogong Village. The village was originally constructed by the Victorian State Electricity Utility Commissions (SEC) from the 1930s and 1950s to house workers on the Kiewa Hydro Electric scheme.</p>\n<p>We see historic vehicles c1950/ 1960 with Victorian registration plates beginning with HEW: 4, parked in the street at the front of the houses. There are images of people as they walk down the street with the mountains in the background.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of fashion, ski wear, and ski techniques in the 60s. Ski Lodge architecture, Bogong Village architecture, vehicles and Falls Creek and Bogong Village landscapes are also a great historic reflection of the era.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:02:00:00 Title “Falls Creek 1960”<br />\n00:00:32:00 Snow-capped mountain with tree covered slopes in the foreground<br />\n00:01:26:00 A young boy struggles to get to his feet after a fall<br />\n00:01:35:00 A young boy stands with his skis over his shoulder in the snow<br />\n00:02:09:00 A young boy plays in the snow beside his stocks.

The film is based on the pamphlet &#8220;Races of Mankind&#8221;, written by Dr.Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish, anthropologists of Columbia University USA, and published in 1943. &#8220;Brotherhood of man&#8221; explodes a number of commonly held fallacies which lead to racial discrimination and group persecution. It gives a clear scientific exposition of a number of basic biological and historical facts, which demonstrate the fundamental identity of humanity, stressing the need for tolerance and co-operation between all groups and races since human beings are always dependent on other human beings.

Takeshi himself plays an exiled yakuza hitman who lands in Los Angeles with a bag of stolen money and resentful of his banishment from the home country. He finds his half-brother (Omar Epps) and together they attempt to take over the drug trade in Los Angeles. A return to highly kinetic crime fiction, &#8220;Brother&#8221; finds Takeshi Kitano in a much more playful mood after the personal reflections of &#8220;Hani-Bi&#8221;. Whipping furiously across the genre tropes of the gangster film and the Yakuza film, &#8220;Brother&#8221; emerges as a highly satisfying ride with deftly executed sequences of violence and warrior mayhem. The cultural differences between the two brothers - one being Japanese and the other being African-American - allows for some genuinely funny reflections on cultural and ethnic misunderstandings, but nothing allows the action to stop for a moment. In Japanese and English with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Los Angeles (Calif.)", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ Los Angeles (Calif.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924506, "name": "Takeshi Kitano", "creator_id": 7712, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924505, "name": "Masayuki Mori", "creator_id": 78820, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924504, "name": "Jeremy Thomas", "creator_id": 62126, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924503, "name": "Bac Films (France)", "creator_id": 26575, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924502, "name": "Film Four International", "creator_id": 23614, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924501, "name": "Recorded Picture Company", "creator_id": 22966, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924500, "name": "Office Kitano", "creator_id": 30312, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 924499, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51521", "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33313]}]}

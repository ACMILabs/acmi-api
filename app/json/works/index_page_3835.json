Along with Whiteley&#8217;s comments on his personal philosophies, the focus of the discussion delves into his fascinations and experiences, expressed through the form of his paintings, in terms of the alchemist notion of transmutation, and the ideal of a journey towards bursting through the boundary to dreams. This is exemplified in the work &#8220;Alchemy&#8221;, where the mind on its meanders, an order lost in detail and an eye to the spiritual is presented in the form of a paneled mural. The program contains footage of the opening of the exhibition of this work with its reception analysed through interviews and sound bytes of Whiteley&#8217;s colleagues, friends and family, art critics and curators, providing a close to this meditative outline of Brett Whiteley&#8217;s artistic process from original concept to exhibition.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Landscape painting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Landscape painting - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Mural painting and decoration", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Painting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Surrealism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Whiteley, Brett, 1939-1992", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "History&nbsp;→ Alchemy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Alchemy", "People&nbsp;→ Whiteley, Brett, 1939-1992", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 812513, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812514, "name": "Dale McCrea", "creator_id": 15724, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 812512, "name": "Video Classroom", "creator_id": 20016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50205", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [32199], "external_references": []}, {"id": 75311, "acmi_id": "012671", "title": "Brett and friends stick to a job: Brett and Greg", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "brett-and-friends-stick-to-a-job-brett-and-greg", "creator_credit": "Film Australia and Bruce Moir", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This tape contains two programs entitled &#8220;Brett and Friends - Why stick to a job?&#8221; and &#8220;Brett and Greg - what are the options?&#8221; Brett and friends sets the context for Brett and Greg and should be viewed first.

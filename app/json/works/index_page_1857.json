In the 1998 series, various members of Northern Access TV assisted in the production of the programs. The programs were all made using volunteers from Northern Access TV on Mini DV cameras.<br />\nThis episode looks at the SteamRail Workshops, located in the former Newport Railway Workshops. It consists of an interview where David McLauchlan interviews Keith Finlay, secretary of SteamRail Victoria Inc. This non-profit volunteer based association aims to preserve Victoria&#8217;s steam powered rail heritage and keep examples of them running for public tours to many destinations on Victoria&#8217;s Rail Network. In addition to preserving the days of steam-powered trains, the group also has sections that are dedicated to preserving Diesel and Electric rolling stock as well. During the interview, we see examples of the work undertaken on the carriages and associated equipment.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroad trains", "Documentary", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2619541, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337225", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2619542, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337225", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2619540, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337225", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2619539, "name": "Michael Costello", "creator_id": 8907, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035297", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2619543, "name": "Northern Access TV", "creator_id": 8909, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036002", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2307", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [48454]}, {"id": 108951, "acmi_id": "B1005478", "title": "[Release prints compilation]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "release-prints", "creator_credit": "Victoria.

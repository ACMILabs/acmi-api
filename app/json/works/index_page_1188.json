The three boys escape, aided by Lilica&#8217;s lover, and get involved with a homosexual drug dealer and an aging alcoholic prostitute. The performances by actual street kids are horrifyingly natural.&#8221; Babenco&#8217;s film was one of the first to address the problem of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s street kids, and with the combination of stark street images and symbolic imagery, the film plays out as a hallucinatory nightmare. A startling critique of third world conditions and societal indifference to the plight of individuals, in particular children, forced to live in appalling conditions. A child&#8217;s life crushed by economic depression, and an astounding performance from Fernando Ramos da Silva, make &#8216;Pixote&#8217; an emotionally gut-wrenching film.

He watches forlornly as the ute disappears into the distance, completely alone save for his little pink toy mouse. Meanwhile, the others have reached the picnic site, and are enjoying the beautiful day. It is only when Mother mouse is distributing glasses of milk that she notices Baby mouse is missing. Baby mouse, still standing in the middle of the road, is frightened by a fly, and flees into the undergrowth, only to stumble upon a raspberry bush, which he quickly strips of fruit. Back at the picnic site, the family are starting to panic when Grandpa mouse has an idea. Packing up the picnic, they all pile into the ute, and slowly drive back along the track, calling out to Baby mouse. Hearing their voices, Baby mouse runs to the car and is reunited with his family once again. They return to the picnic site to resume their outing.

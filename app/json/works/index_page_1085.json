This tribute to his life and work will make people remember his life and work and to think about the poem that meant so much to the people who fought and died in that awful war.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "People&nbsp;→ McCrae, John 1872-1918", "Places&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427660, "name": "Robert Duncan", "creator_id": 76023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427659, "name": "Barbara Shearer", "creator_id": 78498, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427658, "name": "Jonathon Desbarats", "creator_id": 78497, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427657, "name": "International Documentary Television Corporation", "creator_id": 78496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427656, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427655, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43792", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26848]}, {"id": 87353, "acmi_id": "309290", "title": "Wildfire!", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wildfire", "creator_credit": "Jeff Myrow, Ronox Productions and Films Incorporated", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The tragic saga of the Wenatchee forest fire, one of history&#8217;s worst, and the heroic efforts to combat it, is documented hour-by-hour and day-by-day. 8,500 fire fighters faced the flames and dense smoke for 16 days, and bulldozers, aeroplanes and helicopters were also used.

Lonely and desperate she boards the first train heading south. Aboard, she meets vineyard heir Bertrand Meyrand and his wife Patricia, also 8 months pregnant. During the night, the train is derailed. Bertrand and Patricia die during the accident. When Helene wakes up at the hospital, she realises that everyone mistakes her for Patricia, including Bertrand&#8217;s parents who offer her shelter at their wine growing property. Helene settles uncomfortably in her new family, until the day Frank comes back to blackmail her. The plot is based on a story by Cornell Woolrich and was filmed twice before as &#8216;No Man of Her Own&#8217; in 1932 and 1949 in the U.S.A. In 1996 it was remade again as the romantic comedy &#8216;Mrs. Winterbourne&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Alain Sarde ; director, Robin Davis ; writers, Robin Davis, Patrick Laurent ; photography, Bernard Zitzerman ; music, Philippe Sarde.<br />\nCast: Nathalie Baye, Francis Huster, Richard Bohringer, Madeleine Robinson, Guy Trejean, Victoria Abril, Veronique Genest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2162562, "name": "Robin Davis", "creator_id": 83006, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3437057", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2162561, "name": "Alain Sarde", "creator_id": 23743, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q712827", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146622", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [55397]}, {"id": 115902, "acmi_id": "X000060", "title": "Les Maries de L'an II", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "les-maries-de-lan-ii", "creator_credit": "Jean-Paul Rappeneau and Alain Poire", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 1404, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q753122"}], "brief_description": "<p>A few year before the French Revolution, Nicolas kills one of his wife&#8217;s lover and must flee to America in order to avoid police prosecution.

She toys with murdering him, but kills herself instead. With the introduction of colour in his films, beginning with &#8216;Une femme douce&#8217;, Bresson&#8217;s vision darkened, his growing pessimism disclosed in an increasingly voluptuous rendering of the world. (One might say sobriety invites intoxication.) The flatness of Bresson&#8217;s compositions and his emphasis on dedramatization places Bresson in the tradition of modernism, yet his universe often seems archaic.&#8221; Reference: James Quandt.

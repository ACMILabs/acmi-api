Shot entirely on location in Spain, this film is an extravagant tribute to one of history&#8217;s greatest military leaders, a man who earned the respect of Christians and Muslims alike with his compassion and courage, and whose legend was further magnified in an epic twelfth century poem, El cantar del mio Cid. Charlton Heston offers his usual charismatic performance in the lead role, while Sophia Loren is luminous and restrained as the tortured heroine, Ximena. Director Anthony Mann, best known for his Westerns and noirs (and for having directed the first hour of the biblical epic Spartacus before personal differences with star Kirk Douglas forced his replacement) recreates the turbulent grandeur of medieval Spain with spectacular results, filling just over three hours of screen time with huge sets, lavish costumes and weaponry, and impressive and realistic battle sequences. El Cid was nominated for three Academy Awards - Art Direction, Best Song and Best Musical Score - and picked up a Golden Globe award in 1962 for producer Samuel Bronston.

Interviews include Hugo Sanchez and Alfredo di Stefano. &#8220;Football cultures&#8221; Each nation that has embraced football has done so in unique and idiosyncratic cultural ways. This program follows football&#8217;s role within international cultures. Spotlights include: the 1998 World Cup match between US and Iran; acceptance of soccer in Iran; conflicts between Iran and Iraq, on the field and off; the history and meaning of football in Africa - where football remains a hugely popular sport, despite the frustrations of making an impact at the World Cup level.

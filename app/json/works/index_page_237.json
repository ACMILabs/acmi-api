Presented by Dr Kathryn Johnson, Assistant Curator for the &#8216;David Bowie is&#8217; Exhibition from the V&amp;A Museum.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Speaking to the BBC in 1976, Bowie claimed that his career was built on the desire to “be the instigator of new ideas&#8230;.to turn people on to new things and new perspectives&#8230;to be that sort of catalytic kind of thing.“ He described rock music as a medium through which he could achieve this impact and speculated that he would move from using rock in this way to becoming a medium himself, saying, “hopefully that&#8217;ll happen one day&#8230;that&#8217;s really why I do it&#8230;to become a medium.” This talk takes Bowie&#8217;s characteristically self-aware and oblique statement as a starting point for an exploration of his extraordinary creative impact and cultural status. Sharing insights gained during the making of &#8216;David Bowie is&#8217; at the V&amp;A, it explains how the exhibition was devised to perpetuate the catalytic and inspirational power of Bowie&#8217;s art, style and music.

Though he partakes in the Dogme tradition - which seeks to strip away the complete artifice of cinema and usher in the &#8216;real&#8217; through only &#8216;natural&#8217; means - Von Trier also reworks and questions it. He does so by juxtaposing documentary-style, almost &#8216;home-video&#8217; footage, with extremely dazzling, technologically sophisticated, emotionally delirious musical numbers. By throwing together opposite cinematic styles, pushing the characters, the story and the audience to absolute limits of emotional intensity and melodrama, Von Trier not only brings out the essence of the musical as a boundless, overwhelming force, but also asks questions about cinema itself and its powers of storytelling in a post-modern, digital age.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Denmark", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Blindness", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/dancer-in-the-dark", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996177, "name": "Lars Von Trier", "creator_id": 28810, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q133730", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996176, "name": "Vibeke Windelov", "creator_id": 28808, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3556804", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996175, "name": "Trust Film Svenska", "creator_id": 34128, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996174, "name": "Arte France", "creator_id": 32232, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996173, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996172, "name": "Zentropa Entertainment", "creator_id": 34127, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996171, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49981", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 34, "name": "Denmark", "slug": "denmark"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31995], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92503, "acmi_id": "315791", "title": "The End of violence", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-end-of-violence-dvd", "creator_credit": "Wim Wenders, Nicholas Klein, Deepak Nayar, Kintop Pictures, Road Movies and Ciby Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Mike Max (Bill Pullman) is a leading Hollywood producer, whose triumph has come from a string of extremely violent action films.

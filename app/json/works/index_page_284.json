In fact, Czarnecki&#8217;s disturbing yet beautiful parade calls into question everything - past, present and future - that makes us human in the most basic, naked way.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Gina Czarnecki&#8217;s &#8216;Versifier&#8217; places the viewer alone in a room with nine naked figures.<br />\nVarying in age, race and gender, &#8216;Versifier&#8217;s&#8216; pale figures are without identity or voice, like spectres of people with a hidden past that has occurred long before our arrival. Rearprojected onto a vast screen stretched like skin across the space, these human forms suggest early nineteenth-century museum exhibits: human specimens stripped of protective layers and preserved eternally in a captive vessel.</p>\n<p>Currently heading the Electronic Imaging Department at the University of Dundee, Gina Czarnecki works at the intersection of film, video and computer-generated imagery. In describing &#8216;Versifier&#8217; she explains, &#8216;I have always loved the cinematic experience and came to realise that I wanted this in an installation environment. There is something about being in the dark in a public space that focuses your eyes and attention onto small details, sounds, people in the space with you or your inner thoughts and solitude.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Once enclosed within Czarnecki&#8217;s installation, the viewer focuses on the exposed<br />\ninhabitants. With its confronting interface, Versifier challenges notions of modesty,<br />\ncandour, embarrassment, fascination. Experiences that we tend to take for granted are offered up for creepily clinical re-examination. Czarnecki has used digital technology to manipulate the figures into disquieting hybrid forms: skin tones are unusually monochromatic, limbs appear disproportionate and distended. The body itself - the medium through which we all experience the world - takes on disturbing new definitions inside the specimen room that is Versifier.</p>\n<p>Czarnecki&#8217;s mutant characters gesture forward to contemporary anxieties about the looming new frontier of genetic modification, manipulation and experimentation. But they also point backward to personal memories of vulnerability or exposure, and to communal memories of the Holocaust and genocide in which bodies were lined up and exposed in ways that were an affront to all accepted definitions of humanity. In fact, Czarnecki&#8217;s disturbing yet beautiful parade calls into question everything - past, present and future - that makes us human in the most basic, naked way.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "M (15+)", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Multi channel moving image installation"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2368980, "name": "Gina Czarnecki", "creator_id": 7145, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2368981, "name": "Emma Crimmings", "creator_id": 6328, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "530", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [47760]}, {"id": 79836, "acmi_id": "300808", "title": "Double concerto: a film about the pianist Roger Woodward", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "double-concerto-a-film-about-the-pianist-roger-woodward", "creator_credit": "Angela Catterns, Abstract Productions, Endeavour Film Productions and Hugh Piper", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The star of &#8220;Double Concerto&#8221; is the brilliant Australian pianist Roger Woodward.

At the cetnre of the exhibition <i>Two Girls From Amoonguna</i>, is the animated video work <i>Arrkutja Tharra, Kungka Kutjara, Two Girls</i>, which reminds audiences that Mparntwe is filled with joy and laughter. From camping and travelling to town to finding bush tucker, this place is home.</p>\n<p>Tangentyere Artists and Yarrenyty Arltere Artists are akin to community hubs. Not only are they gallery and commercial spaces, but they are also places for young ones to learn and spaces for important community discussions.</p>\n<p>For Sally M Nangala Mulda (Arrernte and Southern Luritja) and Marlene Rubuntja (Arrernte and Western Arrarnta), their art centres reflect their artistic practices. The soft sculpture, sewing and bush dyeing seen in Marlene’s works are synonymous with Yarrenyty Arltere Artists. Tangentyere artists like Sally are renowned for figurative paintings, which are often autobiographical and depict scenes in and around Mparntwe. These centres provide culturally safe places for artists and community. With the success of both artists, they have become prominent figures in their communities and teach many young people within their kinship structure. Intergenerational knowledge sharing is integral to First Peoples’ ways of life – you can even hear the voices of the artists’ nieces and nephews in the animated work.</p>\n<p><i>Arrkutja Tharra, Kungka Kutjara, Two Girls</i> was made in collaboration with Ludo Studio, the Emmy-award winning production company behind <i>Bluey</i>, <i>Robbie Hood</i> and <i>The Strange Chores</i>. It is the third ACMI + Artbank Commission.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Sally M Nangala Mulda and Marlene Rubuntja </p>\n<p>Script: Courtney Collins with Sally M Nangala Mulda and Marlene

The mysterious and arrogant Ahmed immediately halts proceedings, and discovering her true identity, abruptly escorts her to the door. Irritated but intrigued by this brief encounter, Diana struggles to focus on her main goal, dismissed as &#8220;madcap&#8221; by horrified society women: to tour the Sahara desert alone, with only a native man, Mustapha Ali, for a guide. She soon realizes her folly when one day into her adventure she is spirited away by Ahmed and taken to his luxurious desert camp, where his amorous advances drive the despairing but feisty Englishwoman to plot an escape. However, she soon comes to the notice of Omair the bandit, who hatches a plot to steal her from his enemy. Ahmed, tortured by his love for Diana and overcome with guilt over his savage behaviour toward her, risks his life to liberate his one true love from Omair&#8217;s harem. Valentino later made a sequel, &#8220;Son of the sheik&#8221; (1926), the last film he completed before his untimely death. &#8220;The Sheik&#8221; is based on the sensational and exotic 1919 novel of the same name by E. M. Hull. Cast includes Rudolph Valentino as Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, Agnes Ayres as Lady Diana Mayo, Adolphe Menjou as Raoul de St. Hubert, Lucien Littlefield as Gaston, and Walter Long as Omair.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Middle East", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tribes", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Deserts", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Historical films", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Middle East", "Romance", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 815219, "name": "Famous Players-Lasky Corporation", "creator_id": 14122, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 815220, "name": "George Melford", "creator_id": 35087, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50921", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1921", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1921"}], "labels": [32871], "external_references": []}]}

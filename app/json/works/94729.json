Through interviews and personal commentary, the filmmakers present the many and varied viewpoints held by all those involved from all sides of the fence including ERA workers and management, protesters, Aboriginal traditional owners, police officers, tourist operators, and residents of the nearby town of Jabiru. Uranium mining has social, economical and political consequences for Australia and the Australian population particularly in light of the government&#8217;s intention to allow other mining companies to further develop our uranium industry.

Living on the Earth presents a problem for astronomers, as our atmosphere distorts the light which reaches our telescopes from stars. However with technological advances in fibre optics and computer technology, the level of distortion to produce clear images has been reduced. As we near the end of the 20th Century, the wonders of the universe are less of a mystery with the advances in telescopy.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode number 6 of Series &#8220;Universe: the infinite frontier: an introductory astronomy telecourse&#8221;.<br />\nSearching the sky has been a fascination for humans since time began. The challenge was how to make distant objects more visible, and the invention of telescopes made this possible. This episode looks at a variety of telecopes such as reflecting and refracting telescopes, radio telescopes and those which operate in satellites and measure x-rays or gamma rays.

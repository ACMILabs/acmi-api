Cast includes Nicole DeBoer, Nicky Guardagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Julian Richings, Wayne Robson and Maurice Dean Wint.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Imprisonment", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Autism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Change (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Power (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychological tests", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology - Experiments", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/cube-1", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1977941, "name": "Vincenzo Natali", "creator_id": 37208, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q610764", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977940, "name": "Betty Orr", "creator_id": 81159, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977939, "name": "Mehra Meh", "creator_id": 81158, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977938, "name": "Cube Libre", "creator_id": 37205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977937, "name": "Feature Film Project", "creator_id": 35329, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977936, "name": "Trimark Pictures", "creator_id": 26486, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1977935, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53129", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [34573], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95066, "acmi_id": "319111", "title": "The Maids", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-maids-dvd", "creator_credit": "Christopher Miles, Robert Enders, Cinevision Ltee and Ely Landau Organization", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1974", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection&#8221;.<br />\nAdapted from French playwright, Jean Genet&#8217;s absurdist play, &#8220;The Maids&#8221; is about a pair of sisters caught up in a twisted play-acting game whereby their antipathy for their mistress and for each other, is revealed.

Michael has to make decisions in the complex but permissive world of today. His friends have followed a relatively straight and narrow path of conformity. Michael has more or less taken this course, but knows that other ways exist. He is prepared to listen to the prophets of change and revolution and is taken on an excursion into the world of the young radical. In which world does Michael belong?. Features Grahame Bond. Homesdale: Mr. Malfry is having his first vacation at Homesdale - an expensive, private guest house on a remote island near Sydney. The guests are encouraged to live out their fantasies, and have accustomed themselves to the atmosphere with ease. Mr. Malfry emerges as the odd man out and his efforts to mix in are unsuccessful, until a solution occurs to him. Treading a perilous line between horror and farce, &#8220;Homesdale&#8221; deliberately eschews plot and character development. Isolation, eccentricity and mad authority are the ingredients for this loosely woven depiction of life in a mysterious sanatorium. Three directions in Australian Pop Music: Australian Colour Diary 43: Three songs performed by three Australian artists from 1971; Wendy Saddington and Teardrop; The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band and Indelible Murtceps. Long hair, mime and psychodelic lighting are part of the experience! Incredible Floridas: This is composer Richard Meale&#8217;s homage to the French poet, Arthur Rimbaud. Scored for woodwind, percussion and string instruments, it was written for the &#8220;Fires of London&#8221; and their conductor, Peter Maxwell Davies, and premiered in London in 1971 to an enthusiastic reception. Richard Meale is a leader in contemporary music in Australia. Released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment and The AV Channel.

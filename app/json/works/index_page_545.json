She marries the honourable merchant, Cassard (Marc Michel), but when she meets her first love years later, she has to choose between the safety of marriage and the passion and magic of her true love. Featuring glorious sets and art design, this musical has been honoured as one of the greatest of all movie musicals, winning the Palme d&#8217;Or in Cannes in 1964. The ravishing Deneuve has never been more beautiful and Castelnuovo is the epitome of Latin good looks - together they are one of the screen&#8217;s loveliest couples.

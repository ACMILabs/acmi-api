The emotion and tension builds slowly over the time he maintains this charade, with the film&#8217;s dramatically restrained direction and performances getting across the internal struggle he faces daily and the growing suspicions of his family. &#8220;Time Out&#8221; is not just a personal, internal drama but also a commentary on the role of work in contemporary society and its effect on middle-class family life. Written and directed by Laurent Cantet, &#8220;Time Out&#8221; is also winner of best film awards in Venice and Montreal.

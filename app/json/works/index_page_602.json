Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This Penington family trip, captured on film, focuses mainly on dams visited in Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales including dams of the Kiewa Hydroelectric scheme, the Hume Dam in Albury and the old Cotter Dam in Canberra.</p>\n<p>Also shown is the Tronoh dredge in Harrietville, which was active from 1942 to 1954 and was one of the largest bucket drenches to operate in Victoria collecting 53,814 ounces of gold.</p>\n<p>There is a scene of the Clover Dam under construction and views of the town of Mount Beauty before the addition of the Mount Beauty pondage (circa 1946-1950).</p>\n<p>Of historical interest is the Gundagai Timber Rail Bridge and steam train. The bridge spanned 819.4 metres, opening 12th Oct 1903 and closed March 1985.</p>\n<p>Also seen is the original Snows Shopping Arcade in Sydney.</p>\n<p>Monuments seen are the Captain Charles Sturt expedition monument in Gundagai, Corowa’s First and Second World War monument clock, and the J.B Patterson Monument in Castlemaine, Victoria.</p>\n<p>Penington family members seen include Edith and her daughters Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:23:00 views of the Kiewa river and kids playing<br />\n00:00:37:00 old bulldozer moving logs – view of a lady with a vintage pram<br />\n00:01:27:00 Tronoh Dredge, Harrietville (1942–1954)<br />\n00:02:40:00 scenic view of Mount Beauty and beginnings of the township at the foot<br />\n00:02:50:00 Clover Dam under construction circa 1945–1950<br />\n00:03:42:00 the Bogong Dam<br />\n00:04:33:00 view of Mount Beauty<br />\n00:07:18:00 Margaret and Vivienne Penington collecting milk from the milkman<br />\n00:08:05:00 the Hume Dam and Murray River, Albury<br />\n00:08:54:00 Bethanga Bridge<br />\n00:10:24:00 Gundagai Timber Rail Bridge and steam train<br />\n00:10:48:00 monument for Captain Charles Sturt, built in 1829<br />\n00:11:13:00 men hauling machinery off a truck that has crashed off a bridge<br />\n00:12:26:00 Snows Shopping Arcade, Sydney<br />\n00:12:42:00 old Cotter Dam, Canberra – before the extension was added in 1951<br />\n00:13:30:00 Corowa First and Second World War monument clock<br />\n00:13:35:00 street in Corowa showing many cars of the era<br />\n00:14:18:00 J.B.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia.

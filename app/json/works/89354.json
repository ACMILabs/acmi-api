This shattering film is uncompromising in its depiction of the &#8220;new&#8221; urban poor, refusing to allow sentimentality or romance to compromise the ambiguities and complexities of its central character.

Winner of the Palme d&#8217;Or in 1999, &#8220;Rosetta&#8221; created such a controversy that the Belgium government was forced to change industrial relations legislation that penalised young workers (such as Rosetta).

It would be an interesting exercise to compare this film with &#8220;Dr. Strangelove&#8221; as both films deal with the same premise, which led to claims of plagiarism when &#8220;Failsafe&#8221; was originally released.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Atomic bomb", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nuclear warfare", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fail-safe-1964", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2225306, "name": "Sidney Lumet", "creator_id": 72312, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51559", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2225302, "name": "Max Youngstein", "creator_id": 77710, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6794712", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2225300, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2225291, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40629", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [24158]}, {"id": 84667, "acmi_id": "305999", "title": "Ball of fire", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ball-of-fire", "creator_credit": "Howard Hawks, Samuel Goldwyn and Samuel Goldwyn Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1941", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1941-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 48191, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q391452"}], "brief_description": "<p>Gary Cooper takes centre stage in &#8220;Ball of fire&#8221; together with Barbara Stanwyck in Howard Hawks&#8217; deliciously funny, and delightful romantic comedy.

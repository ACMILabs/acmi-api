Joining the human Lister and hologram Rimmer, are computer Holly and Rimmer&#8217;s cat who has now come to life. &#8220;Future echoes&#8221;: The Red Dwarf breaks the light barrier and Holly is having trouble navigating. Cat&#8217;s having trouble narrowing down the number of suits he can take into stasis in preparation, and Lister and Rimmer are subjected to future echoes - visions of what lies ahead. &#8220;Balance of power&#8221;: Lister reminisces about Saturday nights gone past carousing with fellow crew members. He threatens to pass the officer&#8217;s exam so that Rimmer will no longer wield power over him and give himself the authority to achieve everything he desires; cigarettes and a holographic Kochanski.

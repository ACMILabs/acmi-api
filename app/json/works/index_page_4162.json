It elaborates a technique developed in her previous film &#8216;At Land&#8217; in which fresh contiguities of shot relations were achieved through the device of photographing a movement begun in one place, and concluding it by photographing the completion of the movement in another place, thus creating a cinematic time and place which enabled unrelated persons, place and objects to be related and brought into harmony, resulting in a new complexity of meaning and form. &#8216;A Study in Choreography for Camera&#8217; features a leap by the dancer Talley Beatty, in which he begins his leap in the woods, continues it against the background of the Metropolitan Museum&#8217;s Egyptian Hall, and finishes it on the cliffs overlooking a river. Slow motion is used to prolong and dramatise the movement. John Martin, dance critic of the &#8216;New York Times&#8217; called this film &#8220;virtually the beginnings of a new art, choreocinema, in which the dancer and the camera collaborate on the creation of a single new work of art.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Experimental", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Modern dance", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 754567, "name": "Cinema 16", "creator_id": 18129, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 754568, "name": "Maya Deren", "creator_id": 12694, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q450382", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "29045", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1945", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1945"}], "labels": [12816], "external_references": [{"id": 1610, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q27966908"}]}, {"id": 73292, "acmi_id": "010348", "title": "A Street is witness", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-street-is-witness", "creator_credit": "Ifage Filmproduktion (DE)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1963", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The film includes a general history of the erection of &#8220;The Wall&#8221; separating East and West Berlin and focuses on Bernauer Strasse where the street, although part of West Berlin, contains houses down one side which belong to the Soviet sector.

Val Kilmer is engaging as Morrison, a young film student who becomes attracted to the promise and liberation of acid-tinged Haight-Ashbury. The formation of The Doors coincided with the LSD experimentation and the counter-cultural revolution in the American underground. Stone traces the band&#8217;s increasing popularity, their acceptance by the New York avant-garde, including Warhol&#8217;s Factory and Morrison&#8217;s decline through drug-abuse. As the band falls apart, only Morrison&#8217;s identification with Native American spirituality offers an escape from the materialist Hell he is in. This intense and kinetic film is both a celebration of counter-cultural revolution and a sad lament for its corruption.

It is a tale of three lost souls in the equally soul-less modern city of Taipei whose lives repeatedly and unwittingly cross paths in the same uptown luxury, albeit sterile, apartment: Hsaio-kang (Lee Kang-sheng), a gay salesman of crematorium niches coming to terms with his own homosexuality, Ah-jung (Chen Chao-jung) a street hawker of imitation designer goods and Mai Lin (Yang Kuei-mei) a struggling real estate agent.

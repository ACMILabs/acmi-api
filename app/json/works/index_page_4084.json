&#8220;Bring it on&#8221; impresses with its take on teenage values, mores and sexuality, even whilst pandering to the cinematic tropes of the teen flick. Set amid the milieu of an affluent middle class California high school, the protagonists are a predictable blend of bitchy girls who, immersed in their white-bread bubble world of lean torsos and good-hair days, are hyped on competitive spirits and a morally corrupted urge to win. One however learns the values of friendship and loyalty via the &#8216;outsiders&#8217; who invade her naive world and expand her limited experience, providing her with some essential pre-College life lessons. Lead actress Kirsten Dunst emits trademark goofy, sexy charisma in the role of head cheerleader Torrance - a potentially odious character who, in the hands of Dunst, becomes actually likeable.

Spending the summer in the bourgeois surrounds of a borrowed flat, the students become immersed in the doctrine of Chairman Mao&#8217;s Little Red Book, discussing methodologies (which include terrorism and assassination) to overthrow governmental systems. Heralded by some as groundbreaking cinema that subverted popular notions of filmmaking (recall Godard&#8217;s famous quote: &#8220;A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order&#8221;), &#8220;La Chinoise&#8221; also confounded many Godard admirers with its obscure polemic. Cast includes: Juliet Berto, Jean-Pierre Leaud, Anne Wiazemsky and Blandine Jeanson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism and social sciences", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fanaticism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ France - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political science", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Socialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Student movements", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Students - Political activity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - France", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fanaticism", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Student movements"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930530, "name": "De La Gueville", "creator_id": 37356, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930531, "name": "Anouchka Films", "creator_id": 71470, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930532, "name": "Parc Film", "creator_id": 71482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930533, "name": "Jean-Luc Godard", "creator_id": 69995, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930529, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53226", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [34670]}, {"id": 89521, "acmi_id": "312325", "title": "The Chinese connection = Fist of fury", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-chinese-connection-fist-of-fury", "creator_credit": "National General Pictures, Raymond Chow and Lo Wei", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Hong Kong, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This martial arts action film stars Bruce Lee as Chen Chen, returning to his former school in early 20th Century Shanghai to learn that his beloved teacher has been murdered.

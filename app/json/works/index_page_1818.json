Cast also includes Vicki Lewis, Eric Christmas and Maury Chaykin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "Dutch", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "German", "German", "Norwegian", "Norwegian", "Swedish", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Mice", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Pests", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Pests", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pests"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mousehunt", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998516, "name": "Gore Verbinski", "creator_id": 80027, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998515, "name": "Bruce Cohen", "creator_id": 72524, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998514, "name": "Tony Ludwig", "creator_id": 80518, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998513, "name": "Alan Richie", "creator_id": 80517, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998512, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998511, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51637", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33354]}, {"id": 93844, "acmi_id": "317532", "title": "Jesus Christ superstar (2000)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jesus-christ-superstar-2000-dvd", "creator_credit": "Gale Edwards and Really Useful Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#8217;s rock opera, &#8220;Jesus Christ Superstar&#8221; is one of the most successful theatrical musicals of all time.

Christmas for Fred included showing the trains of Flinders St and a W-Class Tram in the City of Melbourne, along with the famous &#8216;Foy&#8217;s Corner&#8217;, corner of Bourke and Swanston St.  There are some amusements in the gardens and some &#8216;Viking&#8217; boats rowing on the Yarra. A Santa in the back of a truck can only mean the office Christmas party. The family relax at a swimming pool and have a picnic in a bush setting. Back to a brief sequence of a helicopter landing on the helipad on the Yarra River, then there is a road trip.

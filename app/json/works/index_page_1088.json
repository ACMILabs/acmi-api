This episode deals with the so-called &#8220;Third Force&#8221;, an unknown force which appeared determined to destabilise and divide the ANC in order to prevent peaceful negotiations between the ANC and the National Party Government. Following Mandela&#8217;s release, South Africa erupted into even further violence as the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (and also with the support of FW De Klerk&#8217;s Government), began attacking and killing pro-ANC villages and communities. Between 1990 and 1992 these attacks by the Inkatha resulted in the death of thousands of innocent black people - the De Klerk Government claiming it was a &#8220;black on black&#8221; conflict. However the ANC leadership, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and even a few ministers in the Government, felt that there was an unknown force behind the Inkatha attacks. Allegations of police involvement, Government military training and weapons supplies to Inkatha members and a political alliance between Inkatha and the Government were put to De Klerk by Mandela but were strongly denied. Mandela resolved to unite his people and as in the 1980s, 1992 began to see the rise of people power. Strikes, rallies, demonstrations and rolling mass action over a period of weeks by the ANC and its supporters saw the Government gradually back down with its repressive law and order regime and break its ties with the Inkatha Freedom Party. By September 1992 ANC and the Government began negotiations towards uniting South Africa and bringing the country to free and democratic elections.

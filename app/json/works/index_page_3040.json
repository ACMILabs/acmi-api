Disney, &#8220;Fantasia 2000&#8221; is a realisation of Walt&#8217;s dream to reissue his marriage of music and animation that was &#8220;Fantasia&#8221; (1940). The brief introduction also covers Disney milestones in animation innovation. &#8220;Fantasia&#8221; was a grand experiment in film-making, a concert film and homage to animation. Stylistically speaking, it prescribed the use of Fantasound which included 64 speakers. Disney originally intended the film to be periodically re-released with the inclusion of new scenes; due to poor audience response and various other factors, this wish never eventuated - until now.

Mr. Qin listens to the matchmaker’s advice and wants his daughter to marry a young man from a well-off family. However, Qin’s daughter, Li Mei, is already in love with another man, Li Shangyou, whose family is quite poor. Li Mei asks her father to give Shangyou a chance, who promises to Qin that he will prepare enough money in three months to marry his daughter. Li Mei, Shangyou and Shangyou’s mother all work hard day and night to make money for the marriage. Just by the time they had the money ready, Shangyou’s mother fell sick but refused to use the money for her illness. Li Mei is moved and determined to marry Shangyou. However, Li Mei’s father severely blames his daughter and forces her to marry the other man. Li Mei seeks support from the director of the Women’s Association, who firmly stands on Li Mei’s side. At Qin’s elder son’s wedding banquet, Li Mei disappears. Shangyou’s mother finds a scarf of Li Mei and sends it to Qin, who is shocked and thought his daughter must have died.

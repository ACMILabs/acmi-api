His mother has been working overseas for so long that he does not even remember her. Grandpa is getting on in years, and finds it harder every day to climb those stairs on his rounds as a Beijing postal worker. But things are about to get really complicated with the return of his mother after so many years apart.</p>\n<p>While a grandpa and grandson fly kites together in the Forbidden Kingdom, suddenly the grandson looks up at and asks if there is a heaven. But grandpa isn&#8217;t feeling so well, and has to rest while little Chenchen peddles them both home on their tricycle.</p>\n<p>They do everything together, and Chenchen often asks to skip kindergarden so that he can spend the day helping grandpa do his rounds. They share a warm and intimate relationship, often acting as though they were two children; playing games, quarreling and sharing toys. Over these past years the kid has taken on many of the household chores and drives pappi around in the pedicab. Everyone on the street remarks on the grandpa&#8217;s great luck to have such a good grandson. Later that night the Chenchen will do all the dishes while the grandpa hangs up the clothes.</p>\n<p>One day while the two are delivering the mail they discover that the elevator of the receiving address is broken, forcing them to climb 12 stories. The upward clamber takes a visible toll on the old man, and when they arrive at the top an old man answers named Zhou Menglan.  He reads the letter and and says they have the wrong person, leading to an arduous ride around Beijing. They eventually stumble across the correct addressee in the cemetery, so they tie the letter and send it up into the heavens. Grandpa is tired after this, grandson notices and gives him his pill, a gesture which warms the old man&#8217;s heart.</p>\n<p>Flash to the kid Chen Chen who arrives at the hospital holding a red balloon to take his grandfather home.

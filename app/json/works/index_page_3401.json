Despite this, Xin Tianxi proceeds to purchase the brass set.<br />\nThey head to the Town Offices to ask the Town Leader for permission. At the offices, Xin Tianxi appears to be attracted to the Township Head Miss Li, and he requests her help in starting the band. Showing her the instruments, he suggests that the band play during Town Meetings, to promote culture.

Miss Li tells the band to stop playing, afraid of the growing familial repercussions for its members. The rift in communication is resolved, and the band members are all happy.<br />\nThe band performs well to a responsive audience at a local awards ceremony, and they demand an encore. Xin Tianxi, knowing that they are now in high demand, tells the village to &#8220;line up&#8221;. The peasant band has changed the village forever.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nThe film has strong Communist overtones. Characters refer to each other as &#8220;comrade&#8221;, wear plain, practical clothing and work in factories. They are told not to &#8220;boast&#8221;, and maintain that they could not afford the instruments if it were not for &#8220;the Party&#8221;. There is a struggle between culture and agriculture, and a reference to Maxim Gorky, founder of Socialist Realism, a Soviet style of art, its purpose the furtherance of the goals of socialism and communism. &#8216;Fascinating Musical Band&#8217; is great example of this style of filmmaking.<br />\n(3 stars - Aleena Glentis; August 9, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:49:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Big band music", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889879, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889880, "name": "Wang Haowei", "creator_id": 34751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889881, "name": "Fang Chunru", "creator_id": 82492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889882, "name": "Yang Shuhu", "creator_id": 82493, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889883, "name": "Li Zhensheng", "creator_id": 82494, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889884, "name": "Jia Wenjing", "creator_id": 82495, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889885, "name": "He Wei", "creator_id": 82496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889886, "name": "Mi Tiezen", "creator_id": 82497, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889887, "name": "Zhao Ziyue", "creator_id": 82498, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889888, "name": "Liang Guanghua", "creator_id": 82499, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146423", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [55271]}, {"id": 94532, "acmi_id": "318440", "title": "Farrebique", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "farrebique-dvd", "creator_credit": "Films Etienne Lallier, Ecran Francais and Georges Rouquier", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1946", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1946-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Farrebique is the first feature-length work for French documentary filmmaker Georges Rouqier.

He flees into the Newton house where he is discovered by the youngest child, Emily. Her siblings Ryce and Ted, and their mother, Alice (Bonnie Hunt), join forces to convince family patriarch George (Charles Grodin) that they should keep the puppy. Despite not being an animal lover, George agrees, and Beethoven becomes a member of the Newton family. Helping Ryce get the attention of the boy she likes, saving Ted from bullies and Emily from drowning are just some of the adventures the over-sized destructive dog gets up to. When an evil vet (Dean Jones) needs a big dog for one of his experiments, Beethoven is his first choice and the family have to race against time to stop the vet from experimenting on their beloved pet.

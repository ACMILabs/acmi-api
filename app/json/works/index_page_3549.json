Initially it is the story of two women: Maya, a rebellious servant girl and Tara her mistress and future queen who are childhood friends. After being publicly humiliated during Tara&#8217;s nuptial celebrations, a vengeful Maya seduces the king prior to his wedding night. When this indiscretion is revealed Maya is spurned and turned out into the street, despite the king&#8217;s burgeoning obsession for her. After falling for a sculptor of erotic deities, Maya trains to be a courtesan, eventually returning to the palace. Nair&#8217;s film operates as a critique of the class system and is a tract about self-determination and sexual politics, but it is overwhelmed by a simplistic script that supports predictable plot and character developments. Nair may have been reaching for a feminist interpretation of the erotic text as well as a narrative about spiritual awakening, but the pretension of the four main protagonists who embody stock Eastern archetypes, distracts from this agenda.</p>\n<p>Producers, Mira Nair, Lydia Dean Pilcher ; director, Mira Nair ; writers, Helena Kriel, Mira Nair ; photography, Declan Quinn ; music, Mychael Danna ; editing, Kristina Boden.<br />\nCast: Indira Varma, Sarita Choudhury, Ramon Tikaram, Naveen Andrews, Rekha, Arundhati Rao.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816645, "name": "Lydia Dean Pilcher", "creator_id": 29543, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16734532", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816644, "name": "Mira Nair", "creator_id": 72766, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q466320", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889598, "name": "Mirabai Films", "creator_id": 24813, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6872285", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889599, "name": "NDF International", "creator_id": 35975, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091233", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889600, "name": "Pony Canyon", "creator_id": 29117, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889601, "name": "Pandora Filmproduktion", "creator_id": 31876, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889604, "name": "Mira Nair", "creator_id": 72766, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q466320", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146383", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 50, "name": "India", "slug": "india"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [55232]}, {"id": 108458, "acmi_id": "B1003091", "title": "Kam Yan Series 2 - Thursday Island", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kam-yan-series-2-thursday-island", "creator_credit": "ABC-TV (Australia).

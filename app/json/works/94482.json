In the Jewish Seeling family, Mum and Dad struggle to come to terms with their gay daughter, who has brought her girlfriend home for the holiday. Heading a traditional African-American family, Ronald works for a racist senator, whilst his visiting mother mercilessly criticises her daughter-in-law&#8217;s every move. Having fled Vietnam the Nguyens live in LA as an extended family, where the teenage children encounter difficulties with assimilation. Lastly, the Avila family celebrate their Latino roots, whilst feeling conflicted by the absence of their ostracised father. A common thread that runs through the film is tolerance and the difficulties inherent in accepting diversity - particularly in relation to the offspring&#8217;s choice of partners.

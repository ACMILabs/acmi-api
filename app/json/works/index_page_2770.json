Contains six segments from the operas: Carmen, Barber of Seville, Turandot, Magic Flute, Rigoletto, Das Rheingold. Traditional puppet animation (by Natalia Dabizha) is used for the Barber of Seville (Rossini) applying a suitably comic tone to the excerpt. Mario Cavalli utilises live action footage, and then paints over the images for his animated segment from Carmen (Bizet). For Rigoletto (Verdi) the dark themes of the opera are ably evoked with stop action puppet animation by Barry J.C. Purves.

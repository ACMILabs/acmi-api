While Technicolor was decades away, the French production company Pathé Frères had developed a technique of stencil-colouring films around 1908. This process used a template for each colour – usually between three and six – and applied it frame by frame. Pathé continued innovating, developing mechanical devices to make the process faster and easier for the more than 400 women colourists working at the company.

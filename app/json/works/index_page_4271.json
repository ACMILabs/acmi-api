This early news bulletin (from 1958) conforms to this rather stilted style of presentation considered appropriate by the ABC. The minimal use of graphics and live news footage, as well as the newsreader&#8217;s accent, are in striking contrast to the way news and current affairs have been presented on television in the decades since the 1950s.</p>\n<p>In this bulletin, the news includes reports of conflict between the Indonesian government and Sumatran rebels, an Australian High Court taxation law ruling, cleaning-up after a big storm in Sydney, the discovery of a World War II mass grave in Poland, elections in Sudan, and a report on the state of the international television industry in 1957.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:14:39:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Australian Broadcasting Commission", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Broadcast journalism", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television broadcasting of news", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1169981, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169982, "name": "ABC", "creator_id": 84432, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1169983, "name": "James Dibble", "creator_id": 74325, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam;

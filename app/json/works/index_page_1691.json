And so their relationship was born. It gets stronger each day with a combination of true friendship and utmost professional admiration. The large shed, surrounded by beautiful native bushland in the Adelaide Hills, has many different projects underway: from old steam engines, dismembered motor bikes to pneumatically controlled guillotines and prototype lathes. We witness this teamwork, as Ramy and his older counterpart design, test and just generally find things to perfect in their shed, never losing their energy to find a solution.

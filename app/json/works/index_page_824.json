The Tracker (David Gulpilil) is a native policeman during a time in which trackers were employed to find suspects. He answers to The Fanatic (Gary Sweet), a cruel bigot who is hell bent on catching The Fugitive, an aboriginal man accused of murdering a white woman. The Follower (Damon Gameau), is a naive young colonial policeman new to the job while The Veteran (Grant Page) is a world weary man whose kind nature is overridden by what he must do and how society expects him to treat blacks.

With its sparse use of dialogue, but much of the film&#8217;s thematic content - about the displacement of Aboriginal peoples by white settlers, and conflict between white and indigenous systems of justice - is conveyed through songs written by Graham Tardif and performed for the film by indigenous musician, Archie Roach.

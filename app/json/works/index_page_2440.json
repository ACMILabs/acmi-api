The plot centres around multi-millionaire Stephanie Harper (Rebecca Gilling), orphaned age 23 and inheriting her father&#8217;s mining fortune as well as the palatial estate, Eden. Two unsuccessful marriages later and dowdy Stephanie is about to walk down the aisle for the third time with smooth, gold-digging tennis champion, Greg Marsden (David Reyne). Loyalties are divided between friends and lovers when Stephanie&#8217;s best friend Jilly (a devilish Wendy Hughes) and her smarmy husband commence an affair. In the now infamous scene, Greg pushes Stephanie into the jaws of a crocodile. Surviving the attack with mainly facial injuries, Stephanie undergoes reconstructive facial surgery to look, remarkably, like her former self. Returning to Sydney, Stephanie reinvents herself as a glamorous model called Tara and introduces herself to the lives of Jilly and Greg who no longer recognise her thanks to the canny use of make-up, a change of wardrobe and a natty new hairdo. Stephanie/Tara manages to convince Greg to take her back to Eden, her old home and the scene where it all began.

The film is a homage to American cinema, namely John Huston, through the underlying motif of failure. For instance, the ending of &#8216;Bob le Flambeur&#8217; is very similar to &#8216;Beat the Devil&#8217; and the scene where one of the protagonist dies in a horse enclosure is reminiscent of &#8216;The Asphalt Jungle&#8217;. What is astonishing is how much the gritty, free-wheeling camera style predates the French New Wave. Everything is already here, the jump-cuts, jazzy score and visual quotes. This is the kind of film that we want to make! exclaimed the young and rebellious Francois Truffaut in 1955. Godard acknowledged Melville&#8217;s influence, giving him an extended cameo in &#8216;A bout de souffle&#8217; (&#8216;Breathless&#8217;). Melville&#8217;s influence has also been acknowledged by foreign filmmaker such as Quentin Tarantino and John Woo. Melville only had a small budget for this film and could only afford three lights. The lack of lighting being a hindrance for depth of film, most of the backgrounds appear soft on the screen.

Three episodes on this one cassette. &#8220;Sixth sense&#8221;: Animals showing special powers have often been regarded as &#8216;supernatural&#8217; but this film reveals that creatures which possess a sixth sense are very much a part of the natural world. &#8220;Seeing sense&#8221;: Vision may be man&#8217;s best sense, but four-eyed fish which see above and below water simultaneously teach us that our sight is not the most sophisticated. &#8220;Sound sense&#8221;: Until now, we have been unable to hear the high-pitched squeaks of mice or the low-frequency calls whales use to communicate across hundreds of miles of sea. This episode opens our ears to a whole register of sounds. A natural landmark in natural history filming, this video is an extraordinary viewing experience.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Zoology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hearing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Senses and sensation", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Vision", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Hearing", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Senses and sensation", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Vision"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816389, "name": "John Downer", "creator_id": 22857, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427267, "name": "BBC Enterprises", "creator_id": 15613, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427266, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39607", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [23169], "external_references": []}]}

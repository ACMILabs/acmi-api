And really, it looks like it&#8217;s a cycle of about every 10 years that someone decides, well, it&#8217;s time that we had another go, so. I&#8217;ve been involved in the three premierships that we have won and involved again at the moment. Balranald&#8217;s a town of 1,400 people. Virtually impossible to keep the young people here. So it makes it pretty hard that way.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>-To get the success&#8212; and I mean, the great form of success&#8212; you&#8217;ve got to bring some players in. And I&#8217;m not being derogative to our boys, but we just haven&#8217;t got the overall talent and the numbers of talented players to win a flag.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>All Central Murray clubs would be spending, at the moment&#8212; the majority of them, anyway, the successful ones, say, 6 or 8 of the top 12, would spend in excess of $100,000 a year on players alone.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>GRAHAM &#8220;JOCK&#8221; CAMPBELL:  It&#8217;s not unreasonable to pay players, $700, $800, $900, or $1,000 a game to be competitive. I have contributed large sums of money. But we&#8217;ve certainly done our homework. We&#8217;ve gone around metro Melbourne and Mildura and hand-picked the players that we reckoned wood do the job.</p>\n<p>[PLAYERS SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>MERV NEAGLE:  I think after the &#8216;94 Premiership, this club won 14 games in 10 years. You know, I mean, and you get sick of it. You don&#8217;t want to go along and the players get sick of it. The all the supporters get sick of it.</p>\n<p>So when all of a sudden, they decided, OK let&#8217;s have another crack at it, it&#8217;s just like a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? OK, we&#8217;ve got a good side. We&#8217;re going to win. Let&#8217;s go to the footy.</p>\n<p>And the whole town on a Saturday when the team plays away&#8212; like we went to Tooleybuc on Saturday. You could have fired a gun up the Main Street of this town and you wouldn&#8217;t have hit anyone. There&#8217;s just a different hype around the place when your football side&#8217;s winning. That&#8217;s how important it is to the town, you know?</p>\n<p>So at the moment, all&#8217;s&#8212; well, we were runners-up last year. And hopefully we have a side good enough to go one step better this year.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>ROB BARRETT: A lot of people don&#8217;t like what we do. And I mean, that&#8217;s the jealousy thing comes into it. And yeah, each time that we&#8217;ve one a premiership, there&#8217;s been money involved. So you do tend to get that.

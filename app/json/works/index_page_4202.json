In an extended flashback sequence Jan first tells of his harassment at the hands of taunting schoolboys, and a disastrous spell at boy scouts. Despite living with his dismissive and draconian father, Jan senses the tide has turned when he falls for a student he is tutoring. But alas it is not to be - his romantic life is marred by accidental involvement in student fascist politics and he is harassed continuously when mistaken for a Jew. Jan joins the army, in the hope of impressing women but is called up when WWII erupts, erroneously arrested when he dons another&#8217;s uniform, and mercilessly ridiculed and ostracised when taken for a spy by fellow POWs. Jan&#8217;s failure at adaptation, in a rapidly changing world, leads to increasing alienation from his fellow man and a continuous lament at his fate or &#8216;bad luck&#8217; that dogs him. With an episodic structure, and utilising an inventive soundscape, not dissimilar to that of Jacques Tati, the film establishes a gently mocking tone that is not only humorous but also decidedly sardonic.

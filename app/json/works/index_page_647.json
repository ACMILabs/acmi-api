An ambient soundtrack along with two discrete soundscapes including dialogue from a group of characters and original music, will also inform the atmosphere of the installation, itself furnished as a room in a generic designer home.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["two-channel video, projection, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1911958, "name": "David Rosetzky", "creator_id": 9248, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1911959, "name": "David Rosetzky", "creator_id": 9248, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "visual artist", "role_id": 493, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2719", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "This work is a commission for the Exemplary Works Collection and is be exhibited in the ACMI + NGV 2004 Exhibition.", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [53675], "external_references": []}, {"id": 108687, "acmi_id": "B1004071", "title": "Burnout 2001", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "burnout-2001", "creator_credit": "Ben Morieson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Burnout 2001 is an interactive game which allows users to use a catalogue of authentic burnout movements to create various markings on the screen.

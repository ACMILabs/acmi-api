The main protagonist is Antoine Sesterain, the mayor of the village and farmer. Antoine is a widower with three sons, all deeply attached to the mountains: Henri, a resort manager, Francois, a skiing instructor engaged to Martine and Pierre, a restless student. Pierre is causing havoc at the boarding school he attends in the valley and where his uncle, Abbe Bonnevie teaches. Following a prank, Pierre is denied permission to leave the school to attend his brother Henri&#8217;s wedding. During the wedding, Lauzon, a local saw-mill owner approaches Antoine with the idea of turning Le Miroir into a skiing resort.

Much of our collection is contained on 16mm film and domestic videotape formats but we also handle 35mm, 9.5mm and 8mm film, early commercial video formats such as 2” and 1” tape, various other commercial and semi-professional videotapes, born digital works on hard drives, games cartridges, thumb drives and audio formats. Preserving such a wide variety means we must also maintain the legacy equipment associated with each format.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→  Foyer&nbsp;→ Entry &nbsp;→ 03.

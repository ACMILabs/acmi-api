Ruan (Maggie Cheung) is already an established star at age 20 when her world starts to collapse. First married to an immature, pleasure seeking play boy, she obtains a costly divorce in order to set-up house with Tang Chi Shan (Tony Leung Ka-fai), a producer at Lienhua who is also a married man. Tired of playing melodramatic characters, Ruan accepts a role in film directed by an up and coming director titled &#8216;New Woman&#8217;.

The press retaliates so violently that massive cuts are ordered to appease the anger of the opinion makers.

Jody is the sweet natured ingenue outclassed by the elite students of the school; Maureen is the child protegee dealing with bulimia and a domineering stage mum; Eva is the African-American rebel seeking validation from her peers. The students struggle with the demands of the school and their personal relationships that at times threaten to thwart the achievement of their exacting goal. Most characters are drawn from stock stereotypes (from the &#8220;Fame&#8221; repertoire), but the drama is affective in its evocation of the young protagonists&#8217; qualms about their uncertain future. Real dancers play most of the main characters, which explains some of the wooden acting, and although the narrative progression is far from unpredictable, the dance sequences are quite stunning and fun to watch. The narrative also touches on body image among female dancers and old style choreography and teaching methods, versus a modern approach.

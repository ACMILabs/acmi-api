This pivotal novel raised awareness of the miners&#8217; plight as they struggled to survive inhumane and dangerous conditions for the profit of the mine owners. Maheu, (Gerard Depardieu) is a miner. He and his wife (Miou Miou) and family eke out a miserable existence in the mines. Their lives are changed when Etienne Lantier (Renaud) enters the district and orginises a miner&#8217;s union. Nevertheless, the quest for profit at all costs causes a further disintegration of conditions and results in a terrible mining accident. Despite the almost unrelieved harshness and pessimism of the subject matter, the film is an excellent historical document of an era; vividly contrasting the squalidness of the miners&#8217; lives to the opulent lifestyle enjoyed by the mine owners.

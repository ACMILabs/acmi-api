This is director Kasdan&#8217;s tribute to the great and much-loved tradition of the Wild West.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:08:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Frontier and pioneer life", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/1985-silverado", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993758, "name": "Lawrence Kasdan", "creator_id": 23995, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q240872", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993757, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1993756, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46618", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [28993]}, {"id": 89500, "acmi_id": "312299", "title": "The Big chill [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-big-chill-dvd", "creator_credit": "Lawrence Kasdan, Michael Shamberg and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46824, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1198794"}], "brief_description": "<p>The archetypal &#8220;Baby Boomers&#8221; movie of the 80&#8217;s which focuses on a group of college friends from the 60&#8217;s who have exchanged their radical ideals for Mercedes&#8217; and &#8220;Yuppiedom&#8221;.

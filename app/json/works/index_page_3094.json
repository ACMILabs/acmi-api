Following the German occupation of Crete, Lind was imprisoned in a POW camp from which he escaped with three other soldiers. This film uses interviews with Lind during his return to Crete in the 80s and re-enactments of the wartime experiences of Lind and fellow soldier, Dick Plant, who were sheltered by the Cretans from the Nazis. A notable feature of the program is the archival German newsreel footage on the invasion of Crete.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Australia - Armed forces", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers - Australia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Crete", "History&nbsp;→ History", "People&nbsp;→ Lind, Lewis"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1097756, "name": "Media World", "creator_id": 22193, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1097757, "name": "Colin South", "creator_id": 22812, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1097758, "name": "John Tatoulis", "creator_id": 22811, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1097755, "name": "SBS", "creator_id": 73033, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115201, "acmi_id": "S00983", "title": "Warriors", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "warriors", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 81631, "acmi_id": "302738", "title": "I Hope the war will be over soon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-hope-the-war-will-be-over-soon", "creator_credit": "Juniper Films, John Tristram, I.

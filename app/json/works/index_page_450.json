Narrated by Leonard Cohen, Part 1: &#8220;A Way of life&#8221; is a path-breaking documentary containing remarkable footage of the rites and liturgies surrounding and following the death of a Ladakhi elder. The Dalai Lama explains his own feelings about death, while other scenes within a palliative care hospice in San Francisco depict the use of the texts to counsel dying patients. This film, by revealing ancient teachings on how to think about death and dying, can be a valuable source of counsel and comfort.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Counseling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Zen buddhism", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Counseling", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alternative medicine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Counseling", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Health", "History&nbsp;→ Religions", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 905217, "name": "Nihon Hoso Kyokai", "creator_id": 13056, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905218, "name": "Mistral Film", "creator_id": 27993, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905219, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905220, "name": "Atsunori Kawamura", "creator_id": 78139, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905221, "name": "David Verrall", "creator_id": 74890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905222, "name": "Yukari Hayashi", "creator_id": 78140, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 905223, "name": "Barrie Angus McLean", "creator_id": 14569, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 905216, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42032", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [25458], "external_references": []}, {"id": 85129, "acmi_id": "306498", "title": "Tibet: the roof of the world", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tibet-the-roof-of-the-world", "creator_credit": "Movie Master", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Passport travellers&#8217; guides&#8221;.<br />\nFor many years, Tibet was a land shrouded in mystery, shadowed by the mighty Himalayas and closed to western travellers.

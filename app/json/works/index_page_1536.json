In Dogtown, twelve teenage friends, many from broken homes, zealously surfed their dilapidated well-protected turf. Known as the Zephyr Boys - or Z-Boys for short - these teenage boys and one girl, applied their well-honed surfing skills to skateboarding and a fad that had all but died out was reborn. Fuelled by competitive drive and pushing each other to perform increasingly daring feats, the crew were inspired when a chronic drought left innumerable swimming pools empty. It was in these empty pools that the Z-Boys skated (illegally) and devised unheard of manoeuvres, revolutionising the sport. When &#8220;Skateboarder&#8221; magazine chronicled their audacious adventures, fame and notoriety beckoned. Whilst competing in the revived National Skateboarder Championships, the tricks performed wowed those present and the Z-Boys ruled. This documentary uses extensive stills and footage from the era (some of it quite astounding) and intersperses it with contemporary interviews with the Z-boys, who reminisce about their glory days and the forces that shaped their destiny.

Effectively utilising the confines of the barrack as an incendiary setting for pent up frustrations, Wilder successfully explores the mob mentality in a compelling manner; less compelling (at least dramatically) are the humorous moments operating as light relief which stagnate the drama, diluting the well crafted tension. &#8220;Stalag 17&#8221; was one of the first films to convey war with humour - a definite precursor to &#8220;M<em>A</em>S<em>H</em>&#8221;, &#8220;Catch-22&#8221; and the campy outlandishness of &#8220;Hogan&#8217;s Heroes&#8221;. William Holden won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the embittered Sefton - a role he apparently reluctantly played.

In the throes of a dead-end career, the cynical Jack is particularly embittered by their lack of success and thwarted dreams of glory that has resulted in a slew of bad gigs at sleazy dives. Frank, a responsible father of two who worries for their finances, is willing to take any gig for a buck. But Jack is resentful of Frank&#8217;s passivity and inability to defend his honour or art. Increasingly unemployable, the brothers hire a singer to spruce up their act - and Susie Diamond, ballsy, rough, lower class but talented, transforms them into a classy act. The alluring presence of the sexy Susie creates tensions for the brothers who are forced to address the inequities and rivalry that mars their relationship.

Bobbie, coming from a seriously dysfunctional family (with hints of physical abuse from his father), begins to form a strong familial bond with the childless Mel and Sid. The &#8216;happy families&#8217; scenario begins to come apart however when the crew begin to get more reckless with their crimes, while falling heavier into drug use. Larry Clark (whose past photographic essays on teenagers inform most of his film work), adopts his usual languid style as the camera casually drifts over young bodies, their boredom only slightly elevated by sporadic bursts of violence. In contrast, James Woods gives his familiar intense performance, while Melanie Griffith imbues her role with a unselfconscious charm as the junkie substitute &#8216;mother&#8217; for this ill-fated family. Cast includes: Lou Diamond Philips, Peter Sarsgaard.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "French", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999033, "name": "Larry Clark", "creator_id": 71719, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999032, "name": "Larry Clark", "creator_id": 71719, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999031, "name": "James Woods", "creator_id": 80713, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999030, "name": "Stephen Chin", "creator_id": 80712, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999029, "name": "Chinese Bookie pictures", "creator_id": 36176, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999028, "name": "MRA Entertainment", "creator_id": 80709, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52152", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33771], "external_references": []}]}

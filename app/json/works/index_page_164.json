Features cameo appearances by Madonna, Quentin Tarantino, Debi Mazar, Naomi Campbell and Halle Berry.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Telephone", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Telephone sex", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Assertiveness (Psychology)", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Acting"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1971277, "name": "Spike Lee", "creator_id": 72793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51566", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971276, "name": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "creator_id": 72572, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971275, "name": "40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks", "creator_id": 25237, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46633", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [29004], "external_references": []}, {"id": 89506, "acmi_id": "312305", "title": "Legends of the fall [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "legends-of-the-fall-dvd", "creator_credit": "Edward Zwick, Marshall Herskovitz, Patrick Crowley and Tri-Star Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on the novel of the same name by Jim Harrison, this sweeping period saga of three brothers, their powerful father and a beautiful women loved by them all, is set against lush Montana scenery.

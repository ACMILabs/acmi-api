The audacious strengths of this exhilarating film lie in Suleiman&#8217;s ability to find the comic and the absurd in the most extreme and horrific of situations. Beginning with the slaughter of Santa Claus at the dawn of the current millennium, the film proceeds as a series of one-take tableaus, which appear initially random but which develop into an increasingly coherent artistic statement about loss, statehood and identity. &#8220;Divine Intervention&#8221; is a brave and unique expression of political cinema that finds apt cinematic metaphors for the terror, fear and violence that define the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Arabic", "English", "Hebrew"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Surrealism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Israel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Israel - Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jerusalem", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Palestine", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Palestinian Arabs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ West Bank", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Israel-Arab conflicts", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Surrealism in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Arabs - Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Intifada, 1987-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Israel - Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Palestinian Arabs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ West Bank - Social conditions", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Palestine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Intifada, 1987-", "History&nbsp;→ Palestinian Arabs", "Places&nbsp;→ Israel", "Places&nbsp;→ Jerusalem", "Places&nbsp;→ Palestine", "Places&nbsp;→ West Bank"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/divine-intervention", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999301, "name": "Elia Suleiman", "creator_id": 36340, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q577569", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999300, "name": "Joachim Ortmanns", "creator_id": 71979, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999299, "name": "Elia Suleiman", "creator_id": 36340, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q577569", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999298, "name": "Humbert Balsan", "creator_id": 29751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999297, "name": "Lichtblick Filmproduktion", "creator_id": 36339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999296, "name": "Soread 2M", "creator_id": 36338, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999295, "name": "Gimages", "creator_id": 36337, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999294, "name": "Arte France", "creator_id": 32232, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999293, "name": "Ognon Pictures", "creator_id": 29749, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

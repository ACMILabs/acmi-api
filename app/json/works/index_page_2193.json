Julie Styron (Stockard Channing) is an astute vice president who, having forfeited intimate relationships, has achieved great success in her career. Panicked by an unexpected call from her boss, she calls on head-hunter Nick Harris (Frederick Weller) fishing for clues. When Paula Murphy (Julia Stiles), a temp who is hired to assist Julie with an important presentation, shows up late, Julie vents her frustration by instantaneously firing her. Later that evening, feeling faintly repentant, Julie buys Paula a drink in the hotel bar, which leads to debauchery. Despite Julie&#8217;s reluctance, Nick joins them, forming an instant attraction to Paula, and from there the film takes a dramatic turn as Nick is drugged (by Paula) and the women conspire to exact revenge upon his prone body.

Based loosely on historical facts, the film proved to be a disappointment on release probably due to the low budget, poor scripting and not enough action (too much of the comedy and romance for dedicated fans of Japanese warrior films). It was eventually reissued under the title &#8220;The Bloody Bushido&#8221;. Cast also includes Sony Chiba, Laura Gemser, Frank Converse, James Earl Jones, Mako, Mayumi Atano, Timothy Murphy, Michael Starr.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Japan - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Foreign relations - Japan", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History - To 1868", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960502, "name": "Tom Kotani", "creator_id": 33834, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960501, "name": "Arthur Rankin Jnr", "creator_id": 20373, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960500, "name": "Bass", "creator_id": 33833, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960499, "name": "Rankin-Bass Productions", "creator_id": 20371, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960498, "name": "Trident Films", "creator_id": 15359, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19578, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Bushido blade (Tom Kotani) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 797, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49840", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [31880]}, {"id": 90067, "acmi_id": "47256", "title": "The Burning question: a fire protection film (B&W)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-burning-question-a-fire-protection-film-bw", "creator_credit": "Eric Morris, Geoffrey Thompson, Council of Fire and Accident Underwriters and Cine Service", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1971", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Modern fire precautions, showing equipment used in Australia.

The hyper-intelligent, mathematics guru, Jim Doyle, gets a job at the largest bank in the country, Centra Bank, after convincing the CEO, Simon O&#8217;Reilly, that he is one step away from cracking the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of economic theory - accurately predicting fluctuations in the stock market. Although the bank has closed multiple branches and slashed jobs, profits are still lagging and the Board demands results. For O&#8217;Reilly, Doyle is the answer to guaranteed ever-increasing profits and corporate expansion. His risk seems to have paid off when Doyle presents O&#8217;Reilly with a flawless formula that predicts an imminent stock market crash: the perfect opportunity for Centra Bank to gain extraordinary market control and power.

Intercutting the scenes of corporate power and ruthlessness is the narrative of a pair of everyday &#8216;battlers&#8217; whose lives are irrevocably damaged by Centra Bank, and seek revenge. Extremely well-crafted and well-scripted, &#8220;The Bank&#8221; is an engrossing, thoroughly entertaining corporate thriller.

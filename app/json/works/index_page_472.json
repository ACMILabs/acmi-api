Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is still in therapy and though he is still baiting psychoanalyst Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), he is getting closer to understanding the source of his anxiety attacks: they are triggered by memories of his violent childhood.

It&#8217;s only when he meets the beautiful Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) that things start looking up for Tony, but soon, in true Soprano&#8217;s style, her emotional instability creates a dangerous domestic situation for him.

Not strictly blues, Bobby serves to act as an illustration of some of the trials and tribulations experienced by legendary performers early in their careers, including the influence of the church. B.B. King, Ike Turner, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon, Little Milton, Howlin&#8217; Wolf, Little Milton, Fats Domino and Little Richard are some of the artists featured. Rosco Gordon takes a tour down Beale Street and recalls the past in a timely interview as he passes away at the end of filming, on a tour, in 2002. Memphis had one of the first radio stations on which African Americans appeared as announcers and performers - this proved to be a very lucrative business and a wider audience developed that also included white listeners. Sam Phillips, who is most well known for recording a 19 year-old Elvis, had been recording black artists for some four years before that. Jim Dickinson, musician/producer is also interviewed about the effect the music had on him. When Martin Luther King was assassinated Memphis city officials decided to tear down Beale Street causing an impact on the black history it represented. Broad appeal to white audiences came about in the 1968, culminating in an emotional 95% white audience in front of B.B.

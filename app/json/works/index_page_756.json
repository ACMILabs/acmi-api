Tom&#8217;s isolation from his family is made worse by his anger at their relocation from London to the lonely coast of Devon, and by his having to keep his anxieties and fears from his mother who has just given birth to a baby girl. But as Jessie&#8217;s behaviour becomes more self-destructive, as Tom&#8217;s suspicions find confirmation, and as he begins to mistrust his father&#8217;s relationships with the three women of the house, Tom becomes more convinced that he must act.

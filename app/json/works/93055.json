McVicar&#8217;s career of violence began from a young age as a petty thief with a &#8220;bad boy&#8221; reputation, to graduating to armed bank robberies and long prison sentences. Whilst serving an 8 year sentence, McVicar made a successful jail break, only to be recaptured and subsequently have his sentence increased to 23 years in a high security prison. This film focuses on the time spent in that prison, the violence and corruption of the penal system and McVicar&#8217;s loathing of everything the system stands for; always taking the opportunity of pushing the wardens to the limit, by force or otherwise.

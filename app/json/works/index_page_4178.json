Simultaneously Yehia (played by the director himself) finds himself attracted to two actors - the handsome young Amr, who Yehia works with on laboured productions, and Nadia, with whom he hopes to collaborate. Following on from the themes explored in &#8220;An Egyptian story&#8221;, Yahia heartlessly forfeits his personal relationships in favour of his work. Yahine&#8217;s struggle to reconcile his art with his ambitions and personal failings is set against Egypt&#8217;s divisive drive, in the 1980s, toward democratic reform. The film takes on a surreal flavour with several musical interludes (one delightfully recalling &#8220;Singin&#8217; in the rain&#8221; as Yehia and Amr celebrate winning the Silver Bear award at Berlin). Chahine applies his signature energy to the film - an appealing mix of whimsy, satire and barbed attacks on the political and social situation in his beloved homeland.

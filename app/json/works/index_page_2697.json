As a child prodigy he was expected to have a brilliant career, but a nervous breakdown on the brink of international success meant that he was institutionalised and without access to the instrument which he loved so much. His voyage out of that darkness into a life which became filled with love, is truly inspirational. Noah Taylor and Geoffrey Rush give exceptional performances as Helfgott, while Armin Mueller-Stahl who plays David&#8217;s father is outstanding. &#8220;Shine&#8221; was a triumph internationally for both the Australian film industry and the relaunching of Helfgott&#8217;s career. It is also a testament to the courage of human beings facing adversity and overcome it. Geoffrey Rush received an Academy Award for his outstanding performance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Helfgott, David, 1947-", "People&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/shine", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2298208, "name": "Scott Hicks", "creator_id": 19844, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q951522", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2298204, "name": "Jane Scott", "creator_id": 19966, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8462137", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2298199, "name": "Momentum Films", "creator_id": 27565, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2298196, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41547", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [25040]}, {"id": 90566, "acmi_id": "313538", "title": "Shiloh", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shiloh", "creator_credit": "Dale Rosenbloom, Zane W.

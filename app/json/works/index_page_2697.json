The narrative revolves around the fortunes of several Danes living near Copenhagen. These consist of: Andreas, a lonely new priest; Olympia, a clumsy pastry-shop assistant coping with an abusive and mentally unstable father; Karen, a hairdresser who has to fend off her alcoholic brain-damaged mother; Hal-Finn, a cafe manager with anger management issues; Jorgen, a loyal friend of Hal-Finn&#8217;s who forms a crush on Italian waitress, Guilia. These protagonists slowly overcome their woes and form meaningful relationships with each other, creating a mini-network of support, whilst also discovering several existing strains of interconnectedness.

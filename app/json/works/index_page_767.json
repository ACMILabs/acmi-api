In this episode Andrew MacKenzie again surprises us with a taste of the local art scene. Lucas Ilhein with &#8216;Found Project Space&#8217; locate themselves on the banks of the Yarra next to the &#8220;yellow peril&#8221; in a performance piece that plays on interaction, racial stereotypes, self-deprecation and a healthy t-shirt business. At Gasworks Arts Inc. Louisanne Zahra walks us through her site-specific exhibition installed within the theatre. The delicate and intricate works borrow much from the 19th Century and explorations in themes of nature and collections. Monash University Gallery has both a collaborative exhibition of Australian and Thailand artists and &#8216;Taring Padi&#8217;, a show of Indonesian artists from the artists collective of the same name. Interviewed is Stuart Koop (curator), Jane Trengrove (artist) and Michael Shaowanasai (artist) amongst others. The irreverent artist Guy Benfield is featured as this episode&#8217;s video artist discussing his motives behind his practice and humorous video works and performances.

Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program&#8217;s style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie again surprises us with a taste of the local art scene. Lucas Ilhein with &#8216;Found Project Space&#8217; locate themselves on the banks of the Yarra next to the &#8220;yellow peril&#8221; in a performance piece that plays on interaction, racial stereotypes, self-deprecation and a healthy t-shirt business. At Gasworks Arts Inc. Louisanne Zahra walks us through her site-specific exhibition installed within the theatre. The delicate and intricate works borrow much from the 19th Century and explorations in themes of nature and collections. Monash University Gallery has both a collaborative exhibition of Australian and Thailand artists and &#8216;Taring Padi&#8217;, a show of Indonesian artists from the artists collective of the same name. Interviewed is Stuart Koop (curator), Jane Trengrove (artist) and Michael Shaowanasai (artist) amongst others. The irreverent artist Guy Benfield is featured as this episode&#8217;s video artist discussing his motives behind his practice and humorous video works and performances. Featured are excerpts from his video works &#8216;Spacewalk(work out)&#8217;, &#8216;Hiace Van&#8217; and &#8216;French Pup (live action)&#8217;.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode number 7 of Series &#8220;Public hangings&#8221;.<br />\nPublic hangings is a local television program on the arts produced for and broadcast on community television (channel 31) in Melbourne, Australia from 2002.

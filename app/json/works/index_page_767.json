Lucas Ilhein with &#8216;Found Project Space&#8217; locate themselves on the banks of the Yarra next to the &#8220;yellow peril&#8221; in a performance piece that plays on interaction, racial stereotypes, self-deprecation and a healthy t-shirt business.

The delicate and intricate works borrow much from the 19th Century and explorations in themes of nature and collections. Monash University Gallery has both a collaborative exhibition of Australian and Thailand artists and &#8216;Taring Padi&#8217;, a show of Indonesian artists from the artists collective of the same name.

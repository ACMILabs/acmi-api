Co-starring Claudine Longet, Marge Champion and Steve Franken with a musical score by Henry Mancini.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parties"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-party", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1989218, "name": "Blake Edwards", "creator_id": 77081, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q56093", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1989217, "name": "Mirisch Corporation", "creator_id": 22759, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1989216, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1989215, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41051", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [24562], "external_references": []}]}

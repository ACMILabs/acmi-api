Lovell (professor of radio astronomy, University of Manchester) is interviewed about the new giant radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. This historic film was shot in the early years of radio astronomy and the Jodrell Bank telescope was one of the most advanced of its kind. Lovell would later play a key figure in the space race over the next few years, aiding the Soviet Union in tracking cosmonaughtical space programs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:14:30:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Astronomy", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Astronomy - History", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Radio astronomy", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Radio telescopes", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Telescopes", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 876641, "name": "British Information Services", "creator_id": 12261, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47389", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1958", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1958"}], "labels": [29678]}, {"id": 95430, "acmi_id": "319568", "title": "The Ghost train", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-ghost-train", "creator_credit": "Walter Forde, Edward Black, Gaumont and Gainsborough Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1941", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1941-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Tales of ghosts and things that go bump in the night feature in this British comedy thriller about a phantom train and a group of travellers stranded overnight in the waiting room of a small Cornish junction station.

It marks the beginning of Vorhaus&#8217; association with Twickenham Studios. The film announces to the world a director with ideas of his own by kicking off with what may well be the first-ever pre-credit sequence. And it does exactly what a good pre-credit sequence should do: sets up the premise of the film, establishes the mood and piques our curiosity. It is worth recalling that 1933 audiences would most likely have had no advance knowledge of what they were about to see. Few people would trouble to enquire about the supporting feature beforehand, and might not even notice the title. By boldly setting up the mystery in this way, Vorhaus hoped to hold his audience&#8217;s attention through an hour or so of Fowler Mear&#8217;s lumbering banter. Cast includes Henry Kendall, Ida Lupino and John Mills.

No risible Hornby-Double-O model shots, either: the trains are very much for real.

During its runaway course, the train twice barrels at full lick through a station where it is supposed to stop, to the alarm of the passengers and railway official alike. Two such episodes could have been repetitious; but by varying his camera angles and tossing in lighting gags and character vignettes Vorhaus neatly differentiates them.

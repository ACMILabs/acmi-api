Stars Les Rubie and Matt Craven. (Awards: Toronto)</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Tommy is a veteran of World War II. He rooms alone, waiting for his pension cheque to arrive, passing the time in the evenings with his cronies in the Legion Hall. Lennie can claim only a third of Tommy&#8217;s years, but he prowls the same area of town, and, surprisingly enough, they have more in common than either of them realises. Bravery in the Field portrays the frustration&#8217;s and hostilities of these two men whose lives lack a sense of place and purpose. This dramatised story occurs early in November and leads up to an event that provides one of Tommy&#8217;s few remaining moments of glory: the annual veterans&#8217; Remembrance Day parade.

Based on Harvey&#8217;s comic book &#8220;American Splendor&#8221; written by Harvey and illustrated by R.Crumb, he details the mundanities of ordinary life in such a way that makes for a great commentary on working class life in everyday America. The film covers the period of Harvey&#8217;s life when he gets divorced, looses his voice and compulsively collects old jazz records, to the time when he meets his new wife (Hope Davis), goes on the &#8220;Letterman&#8221; show to promote the comic, gets cancer and goes on to be part of this film. Cleverly realised we traverse his life via comics and actors, as well as interjections from the real Harvey, making an &#8220;ordinary life&#8221; quite compelling viewing.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jews - Social life and customs", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Comic books, strips, etc.", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Crumb, R.", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Urban poor - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cancer", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic books, strips, etc.", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "People&nbsp;→ Crumb, R."]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964757, "name": "Shari Springer Berman", "creator_id": 81039, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964756, "name": "Robert Pulcini", "creator_id": 81038, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964755, "name": "Ted Hope", "creator_id": 77844, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964754, "name": "Fine Line Features", "creator_id": 3881, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964753, "name": "Home Box Office", "creator_id": 22860, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964752, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20429, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mrcv1YL84tTkZDTjkwZaBmkyKB6.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "American splendor (Robert Pulcini; Shari Springer Berman) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52949", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [34404]}, {"id": 80777, "acmi_id": "36599", "title": "American Rebel", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "american-rebel", "creator_credit": "Will Roberts and United Documentary Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1985", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Biographical documentary of an all-American boy who turned communist pop star, Dean Reed.

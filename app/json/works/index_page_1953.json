Edwina (Jennifer Saunders) is a baby-boomer mother, fashion victim extraordinaire. Her best friend is the cocaine-snorting nymphomaniac Patsy (Joanna Lumley). Part of the show&#8217;s success comes from its reversal of roles. It is the practical long-suffering Saffie, Edwina&#8217;s daughter, who sweeps up after her mother, and the in-your-face portrayal of drug-taking, sex-loving, materialistic women who are spoilt, selfish, vacuous but undeniably good fun.

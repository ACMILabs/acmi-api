The rehearsals, filmed by Rivette (in 35-millimeter) and by TV documentarist Andre S.

In the rehearsal space Rivette cuts frequently between the 35- and 16-millimeter footage, juxtaposing two kinds of documentary reality; in the couple&#8217;s apartment, filmed only in 35, the oscillation between love and madness, passion and mistrust, builds to several terrifying and awesome climaxes in which the distinctions between life and theater, reality and fiction, become virtually irrelevant. In many ways this is Ogier&#8217;s richest, finest performance, and Kalfon keeps pace with her every step of the way.

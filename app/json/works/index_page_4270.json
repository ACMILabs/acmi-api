According to his daughter, George was ‘optimistic, happy and enthusiastic’, an outlook reflected in his films which are a lovely history of home life and a love of travel.</p>\n<p>George came to Australia from England as a young man by way of the merchant navy, after having seen South America and some of Asia. He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>Note, the documentary ‘How I Filmed the War’ which is included in the collection was made by George’s uncle and official war photographer Geoffrey Malins. Geoffrey was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) for his work in filming the ‘Battle of the Somme’.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter, Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films",

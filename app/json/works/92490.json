Haneke&#8217;s films have often been accused of didactism and moralism (often by a defensive critical film culture which has abandoned political and metaphysical engagement for the laissez-faire aesthetics of denuded postmodernism), but as this film makes clear his commitment is to a critical and intellectually rigorous cinema which utilises modernist techniques to essay the state of contemporary social relations in Europe.

Though undeniably bleak, by refusing the pessimistic lure of nihilism, Haneke&#8217;s film legitimates the radical potential of film at the end of the century.

Chronically alcoholic for years, she is brought out of her stupor with the news of her husband&#8217;s suicide and revelations about the state of his business. Vincent has left seven diamonds of dubious provenance for Marianne. This is enough for Marianne to decide to sober up, revive her shattered career as a diamond expert and try to sell the gems. She finds herself thrown into a web of intrigue involving a former lover (Jacques Dutronc), the same who once destroyed her good name by compromising her into a smuggling operation. Catherine Deneuve was awarded the Best Actress Prize at the 1998 Venice Film Festival (Mostra). Cast also includes Jean-Pierre Bacri and Emmanuelle Seigner.

Naturally with this new environment the dynamics change. No longer is Buffy the master of her own destiny as she discovers in the opening episode (ep, 45 The Freshman). In fact, university life proves to be a difficult adjustment for the slayer as a band of campus vampires target the fragile Buffy and she misjudges the intentions of the campus lothario. Meanwhile, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) has come into her own.

There are some welcome returns (and not so welcome) to Sunnydale, notably Anya (Emma Caulfield), an ex-vengeance demon who decides to romantically pursue Xander. The other returning character is the indestructible vampire Spike (James Marsters) who returns with a new girlfriend in tow, the flaky Harmony (ep. 47 The Harsh light of day). The big season arc turns out to be the revelation that Sunnydale college also contains a secret initiative set up by the government to combat the demon problem (ep. 51 The Initiative).

All over the globe Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) had entered into the consciousness of popular culture. Season two ended with Buffy running away from Sunnydale after having to kill her one true love Angel (David Boreanaz) who had turned into the evil Angelus. Complicating matters further was Buffy&#8217;s mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) who discovered that her teenage daughter was a vampire slayer. Season three opens on a Sunnydale, minus Buffy which is proving a burden for the rest of the Scooby gang whose vampire skills aren&#8217;t on the same level as the slayer (Eps. one, Annie). Buffy eventually returns to Sunnydale to find a new slayer in town, the rough and impulsive Faith (Eps. three, Faith, hope and trick). Each season creator Joss Whedon and his team of writers face the challenge of providing fresh and inventive adversary&#8217;s for Buffy and her gang to fight. In season three they rise to the challenge with the introduction of the Mayor (Harry Groener), a villain whose unnerving chirpy demure hilariously clashes with his plans for world domination and the destruction of Sunnydale as we know it. With season three Whedon played up even more the hormonal havoc his teenage leads have to contend with, as Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) overstep the line in their friendship and a potential new romance for Buffy is thwarted by the shock return of Angel (Eps. four, Beauty and the beasts). Other highlights include the introduction of Anya (Eps. nine, The wish), a vengeance demon that grants Cordelia&#8217;s wish of a Sunnydale without Buffy and the exciting two part finale (Eps. twenty one and twenty two, Graduation day) where the Mayors apocalyptic &#8216;ascension&#8217; comes to fruition.

All over the globe Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) had entered into the consciousness of popular culture.

Each season creator Joss Whedon and his team of writers face the challenge of providing fresh and inventive adversaries for Buffy and her gang to fight. In season three they rise to the challenge with the introduction of the Mayor (Harry Groener), a villain whose unnerving chirpy demure hilariously clashes with his plans for world domination and the destruction of Sunnydale as we know it.

Other highlights include the introduction of Anya (Eps. nine, The wish), a vengeance demon that grants Cordelia&#8217;s wish of a Sunnydale without Buffy and the exciting two part finale (Eps. twenty one and twenty two, Graduation day) where the Mayor&#8217;s apocalyptic &#8216;ascension&#8217; comes to fruition.

This was the year that &#8220;Buffy the Vampire slayer&#8217;s&#8221; popularity went from small cult following to full blown media event, gaining some of the highest ratings the show has ever had in the US. Season two also saw the introduction of the cool and mysterious Oz (Seth Green), who became a &#8216;Scooby gang&#8217; regular and a potential love interest for Willow. Unfortunately, like everything else in Sunnydale High, gateway to the hellmouth, Oz has teen issues of the supernatural kind (Ep. 15, Phases). Love is also in the air for Zander (Nicholas Brendan) as he hooks up with the &#8216;cliquey&#8217; Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), an unlikely paring which results in much bitchy repartee (Ep. 10, What&#8217;s my line, Part two). Aside from a new slayer unexpectedly arriving on the scene (Ep. 9, What&#8217;s my line, Part One), season two&#8217;s biggest surprise ended up being the transformation of Buffy&#8217;s &#8216;soulful&#8217; vampire boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz) into the uber evil, Angelus (Ep. 13, Surprise and Ep. 14, Innocence). This causes the love struck Buffy much grief as she has to make some difficult and painful decisions (Ep. 22, Becoming, Part two). Meanwhile, Angelus makes it his personal mission to make the slayer&#8217;s life hell (Ep. 17, Passion), while joining forces with Spike and Drusilla as they attempt to awaken a demon that will suck the world into hell (Ep. 21, Becoming, Part one and Eps. 22, Becoming, Part two).

Buffy - cheerleader, girlfriend, air head and popular student finds her life turned upside down when a strange man in a trench coat, Merrick (Donald Sutherland), interrupts cheerleading practice to tell her it&#8217;s time to acknowledge her birthright. For as long as there has been vampires, there&#8217;s been the slayer - one girl, hand picked out of the entire world as championing the cause against the creatures of the night. When Buffy finally accepts her fate, she is coached by Merrick to fight lead vampire Rothos (Rutger Hauer), someone who has been visiting her in her dreams. As Buffy discovers fighting capabilities she never knew she had, and realises the responsibility she now wears, she finds herself drifting away from her vacuous friends and is drawn to the elusive, older, Pike (Luke Perry). The film culminates at a dance in the gymnasium. While there are no cross over characters or actors between the movie and the series, fans of either film or television versions will enjoy the tongue in cheek horror that Buffy is synonymous for.

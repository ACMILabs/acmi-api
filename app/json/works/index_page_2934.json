The production crew of this outstanding documentary were given unlimited access to Monet&#8217;s estate for a year, which allows the viewer to witness the full cycle of the seasons. Monet was a passionate horticulturalist who invested a lot of time in the garden at Giverny; this programme explores the enduring legacy of beauty that he left in the garden and in his art, and the incredible interrelationship between the two. Includes interviews with artists Kaffe Fassett and Paul Riley and photographer and Monet authority Vivian Russell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Horticulture", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Gardens - France", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - France", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Horticulture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Monet, Claude, 1840-1926", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Hobbies", "People&nbsp;→ Monet, Claude, 1840-1926"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2168688, "name": "Emma Ford", "creator_id": 29510, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091124", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2168684, "name": "Sadie Hennessy", "creator_id": 29509, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298890", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2168681, "name": "Two Four Productions", "creator_id": 29028, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143654", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2168677, "name": "Viburnum Gardens", "creator_id": 76390, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43926", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [26976]}, {"id": 86267, "acmi_id": "307924", "title": "Molly", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "molly", "creator_credit": "Ned Lander, Hilary Linstead and New South Wales Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44477, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q6896507"}], "brief_description": "<p>Molly is a dog with a special gift- she can sing.

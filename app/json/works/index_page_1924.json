sound was born in the hotels and bars of our major cities in the 1970s.<br />\nIn the Melbourne scene, the &#8216;beer barns&#8217; of the suburbs were complemented by smaller, more intimate venues in the city and inner suburbs of Carlton, Richmond, Fitzroy and St Kilda.<br />\nThis film - made in his student days by award-winning producer Daniel Scharf - presents a 1979 performance by the Melbourne band &#8216;Cuban Heels&#8217; at one such venue, &#8216;Hearts&#8217; in Carlton.<br />\nThe atmosphere of alcohol, cigarette-smoke and youthful exuberance is captured by the camera as it wanders through the audience and lingers on the dancers.<br />\nOn stage, the band (led by Steve Connolly, who was later the guitarist with Paul Kelly&#8217;s &#8216;Coloured Girls&#8217; and &#8216;Messengers&#8217; bands) sings a song that could only be a product of the 1970s - about &#8216;the system&#8217; and the coming revolution.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:08:10:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Social life and customs", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Cuban Heels (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ New wave music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 998524, "name": "Daniel Scharf", "creator_id": 55527, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 998525, "name": "Cuban Heels", "creator_id": 84258, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [{"id": 1083, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/tWdHY5pKsf8"}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file H264;

It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to Taiping, Malaysia and Tarakan, Borneo and then journeys throughout Australia during 1961.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>This film has a few scenes from Billy’s travels to Taiping in Malaysia before moving on to Sydney and Melbourne. Billy includes some lovely scenes of being at sea, ships and shipping. The scenes in Sydney include the Harbour, the Bridge and some busy streets.

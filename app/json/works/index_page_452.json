In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows various recreational activities in the life of the Anderson family, including water skiing, riding speed boats on a lake, a trip to the snow, visiting the Royal Melbourne Show, birthday parties, swimming at a local pool, and a Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 skimming stones at the river<br />\n00:01:15:00 picnic lunch, eating sausages in bread<br />\n00:03:55:00 an ANSETT plane at a country airport<br />\n00:07:40:00 water skiing on a large lake<br />\n00:08:25:00 groups of people on the shores of the lake<br />\n00:09:46:00 man with binoculars<br />\n00:10:24:00 kids eating ice creams<br />\n00:11:02:00 sign for ‘Water Ski Spectacular: The Fastest Show on Water’<br />\n00:11:18:00 the three boys at a table set with birthday cake and party cups<br />\n00:15:04:00 on a speedboat on the lake<br />\n00:18:47:00 another birthday party with balloons and cake<br />\n00:18:56:00 double-layer sponge cake on a rotating tray (lazy Susan)<br />\n00:21:47:00 blowing out the candles on the cake<br />\n00:22:33:00 trip to the snow<br />\n00:23:18:00 kids learning to ski<br />\n00:25:00:00 siblings in matching outfits holding hands at the Royal Show<br />\n00:25:12:00 Showbags stall<br />\n00:25:17:00 on the Racing Speedboats ride<br />\n00:26:15:00 the Kiddies Ferris Wheel<br />\n00:26:25:00 the Merry-Go-Round with the older girls holding the boys on<br />\n00:27:08:00 on the Speed Car ride<br />\n00:27:57:00 girl with fairy floss in front of the fairy floss stand and then thoroughly enjoying it<br />\n00:28:13:00 sign for ‘Delicious Flavoured Milk’<br />\n00:29:29:00 the Mad Mouse ride<br />\n00:30:00:00 Christmas morning with a pile of presents under the tree and the kids in their pyjamas<br />\n00:31:25:00 in the backyard riding new bikes and race car toys<br />\n00:33:15:00 playing at the local pool with an inflatable boat<br />\n00:37:34:00 a large group of kids lined up for a bike race<br />\n00:38:37:00 group of girls on the trampoline<br />\n00:39:04:00 cake with a ballerina and ‘Happy Birthday to Denise’ written on top<br />\n00:39:28:00 blowing party horns</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:41:15:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387521, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

There is some great footage of fashion in the 1960s, particularly beach wear.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 a birthday party, kids eating cake and wearing paper hats<br />\n00:01:08:00 a boy blowing vigorously on a party horn<br />\n00:02:00:00 birthday boy receiving his gift, a Tommy Thunder toy machine gun<br />\n00:02:33:00 girl with fake vampire teeth<br />\n00:03:01:00 people sunbaking on the beach<br />\n00:04:03:00 the three boys learning to swim<br />\n00:05:47:00 snow or hail on the streets of Ballarat, driving through the storm<br />\n00:06:12:00 kids on toy bikes and pushing a dog in a pram<br />\n00:07:45:00 rows of children in matching outfits at church<br />\n00:08:25:00 learning to ride a bike<br />\n00:10:30:00 First Communion at church with all the girls in white dresses and veils<br />\n00:11:57:00 an older couple walking down the street<br />\n00:13:00:00 boys in party hats<br />\n00:13:40:00 birthday cakes and frog in a pond (chocolate frog in jelly)<br />\n00:14:45:00 more relaxed sunbaking on the beach<br />\n00:15:16:00 the three boys in matching bathers (swimwear)<br />\n00:15:47:00 picnic under a large red beach umbrella<br />\n00:16:42:00 boy in yellow terry towelling hat enjoying a can of Fanta<br />\n00:18:55:00 group of kids exploring on the beach and throwing food to seagulls<br />\n00:21:03:00 on the slide at local playground</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:21:15:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 1}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387518, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

Ms Ding has newly arrived at a ship factory, and she will be the night school teacher there. Her students are a group of bachelors who are attracted by Ding’s beauty but have little interest in her class. They feel ashamed to be taught by such a young lady and believe that they know more than her. However, it proves that they are wrong at work. Workshop leader, Shi Qilong falls in love with Ding and begins to study hard. He seeks help from his friend, Liu Tie, who has been avoiding Ding since she came here. Ding later learns that Liu Tie is her childhood friend, who she has lost contact for years. It turns out that Ding is from a well-off family and her parents were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. Ding was adopted by Liu’s mum and the two grew up together and liked each other. But after the Cultural Revolutionary, Ding went to university and her parents, without letting their daughter know, told Liu to stop contacting their daughter.

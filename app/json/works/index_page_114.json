In April of 2021, when asked about Scott Morrison’s <a href=\"https://www.mamamia.com.au/brittany-higgins-scott-morrison/\">‘as a father’</a> response to rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins – which some believe he didn’t take seriously until <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-criticised-for-invoking-his-daughters-in-response-to-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations/f749bed4-feb5-4903-9338-0d03b10d795f\">“viewing it from the lens of being a father of daughters”</a> – Tame responded: “It shouldn’t take children to have a conscience. And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience.” Like this most recent interaction with the Prime Minister, that clip also went viral on the internet, helping solidify Tame’s position as a courageous advocate for sexual assault survivors and a moral champion at a time when many see Australia’s leaders as lacking both courage and morals.</p>\n<p>As Imogen Champagne writes in <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/01/27/grace-tame-side-eye-peter-van-onselen/\"><i>Crikey</i></a>:, &#8220;Conservatives have been trying to silence Grace Tame all year.

The father offers one million pounds, Bond asks for the location of Ernst Blofeld (Telly Savalas), head of SPECTRE in return. Disguised as a (kilted) genealogist with the College of Arms, Bond travels to Blofeld&#8217;s Alpine residence to discuss investigation into whether Blofeld is a legitimate count. Once there, Bond stumbles across a bizarre scene in which he dines with a room containing a bevy of beautiful women eating only one type of food. This is part of their treatment at Blofeld&#8217;s allergy treatment clinic that also includes late night brain-washing. The clinic is a sinister front - Blofeld is planning a bacteriological war. Features a car rally on ice with Diana Rigg in the driver&#8217;s seat, and plenty of down hill skiing and other snow-related action. In a departure from most Bond films, Bond (George Lazenby in his only performance as 007) actually falls for the girl, confessing his love and proposing, surviving a brief but ultimately tragic marriage.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Chemical warfare", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Spies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2795106, "name": "Peter Hunt", "creator_id": 74169, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q707773", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2795104, "name": "Albert R.

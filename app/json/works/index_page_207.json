Pursued by the police, Midori&#8217;s enraged husband and Colin&#8217;s murderous gang, Colin and Midori flee towards the outback. En route the pair meet a slew of eccentric characters, attend a B and S ball and have a variety of experiences, which unites them romantically. &#8220;Heaven&#8217;s burning&#8221; is a road movie, and typically of the Australian genre, has the action contained within a deterministically peculiar outback culture. Midori&#8217;s ethnicity serves as a conduit on which to channel a range of unoriginal Aussie stereotypes, as well as highlighting racism and cultural intolerance. The film is a mix of genres - romance, crime flick, thriller - and is slavish in its desire to appear offbeat and original. Cast also includes Kenji Isomura, Ray Barrett and Robert Mammone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Literature&nbsp;→ Nowra, Louis", "People&nbsp;→ Nowra, Louis", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/heavens-burning", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962299, "name": "Dup Art", "creator_id": 35150, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962300, "name": "Helen Leake", "creator_id": 80267, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962301, "name": "Al Clark", "creator_id": 731, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962302, "name": "Craig Lahiff", "creator_id": 20079, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962298, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50977", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32921], "external_references": [{"id": 1088, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1516308"}, {"id": 4376, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "70581"}]}, {"id": 83115, "acmi_id": "304309", "title": "Heathers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "heathers", "creator_credit": "New World Pictures, Cinemarque Entertainment, Denise Di Novi and Michael Lehmann", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1989", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This black comedy about high school politics, teenage suicide and trendy cliques, focuses on the &#8216;Heathers&#8217;, three of the prettiest and most popular rich girls at Westerbury High School, home of preppies, nerds and trendies.

One summer a mysterious boarder Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) comes to live in the upstairs part of the house and wins over Bobby, if not his suspicious mother, Liz. It is gradually revealed that Ted has psychic powers and sinister men in dark suits are pursuing him. Bobby, in need of a father figure, is drawn into Ted&#8217;s confidence, working for him, and absorbing Ted&#8217;s wisdom. Ted assists Bobby with difficult life matters - his first kiss, trust in others, and lessons in disappointment. Structured as a flashback, &#8220;Hearts in Atlantis&#8221; has a tone not unlike a darkly themed episode of &#8220;The Wonder years.&#8221; Hicks peppers a pedestrian screenplay, laden with symbolic diatribes, with 60s hits, an expressive score, and an eye for period detail.

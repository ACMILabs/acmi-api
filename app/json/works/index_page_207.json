As per the genre, Howard has an equally nebbish fiancee, who is of course but a minor obstacle in the course of true love. The film scores lots of laughs with a series of mixed up suitcases, missing jewels, an extensive chase scene, and romantic interludes. &#8220;What&#8217;s up Doc?&#8221; manages a successful mix of rapid fire dialogue, physical comedy and charming lead performances, which made it one of the big hits of 1972, the second in a row for director Peter Bogdanovich (The Last Picture show, Paper moon, The Cat&#8217;s meow).

Denied the chance to study singing in Milan at age sixteen due to the death of her mother, Annie has given up singing altogether and is barely hanging onto dregs of a dull romance with Colin, a man whom she has to bribe for sex. Just when it seems she may have a chance to have a life of her own, Annie Mary&#8217;s father has a stroke, and she is forced to take the reigns of his bakery and care for him at home. When Annie Mary realises that her best friend is dying, she desperately tries to raise money for a trip to Disneyland by forming a pop group and entering a talent contest, with one thousand pounds in prize money. A comedy of sorts, &#8220;Very Annie Mary&#8221; features several song and dance routines in the mode of &#8220;The Full Monty&#8221; and like that film, the depressed economy is the backdrop against which the townspeople hope to illicit a modicum of happiness from their penny pinching lives.

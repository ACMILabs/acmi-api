After a raid, Cesira, a beautiful widow who is propositioned at every turn, decides to relocate them to the rural village where she was born. Cesira idealises her innocent teenage daughter, attempting to shield her from the reality of war crimes and the potential danger (in particular rape) that the two face. Michele (Jean-Paul Belmondo) an idealist, who is horrified by the pettiness of the villagers, falls in love with Cesira. A love triangle forms between mother, daughter and Michele as war closes in around the village. Adapted from the Italian novel by Alberto Moravia, &#8220;Two women&#8221; effectively displays the randomness of war that can turn an individual&#8217;s fate to terror and the deprivations that reduce simple acts of kindness to bitter transactions. Sophia Loren won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Cesira, an uncommon accolade at that time. This is the dubbed version with Sophia Loren dubbing her own voice.

Elle is a confident woman who wantonly displays her sexy body and soon has every man in town captivated. Alain Souchon plays Pin Pon, a mechanic who falls into an obsession with Elle, and agonizes over invalidated rumours of other men&#8217;s conquests of her. Motivated by revenge, Elle easily draws Pin Pon into her orbit and soon moves in with him, despite the disapproval of his pious mother. Through a series of flashbacks it is revealed that twenty years earlier, in the post war period, Elle&#8217;s mother was brutally gang raped by several French deliverymen. Elle, tortured by issues of her parentage, is driven to avenge her mother&#8217;s rape but is also stirred by secrets from her own past that exacerbate her increasingly unstable mental condition. The switching of first person narration allows for multiple viewpoints to be appreciated by the viewer. This is a tragedy about vengeance, obsessive behaviour and neuroses.

A fine example of &#8216;cinema verite&#8217;, the cycle of the seasons is linked to the cycles of life &#8212; birth, death, renewal &#8212; providing a humanist view of nature and the intrinsic phases of rural life. Featuring beautiful time-lapse photography to display the coming of Spring, the film can be read as a paean to a bucolic life, observing the minutiae of nature as well as documenting the hardships of working the land. This fascinating work is highly regarded and won numerous awards including the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes, 1946.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Time lapse cinematography", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural families", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature photography", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Cinema verite", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - France", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnology", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural families", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Places&nbsp;→ France"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929123, "name": "Georges Rouquier", "creator_id": 17796, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2354287", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929122, "name": "Ecran Francais", "creator_id": 36557, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929121, "name": "Films Etienne Lallier", "creator_id": 36556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52490", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1946", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1946"}], "labels": [34038]}, {"id": 88403, "acmi_id": "310967", "title": "Farnborough 1968", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "farnborough-1968", "creator_credit": "British Movietone News", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1968", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Farnborough Air Show - 26th exhibition and flying display.

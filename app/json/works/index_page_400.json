Ah Long is a jobless young man who is recently set free from the jail. Wanting to start a new life, Ah Long sold all his valuables such as watch, TV and radio, and borrowed some money from friends in order to open a fish stall. He bought a Yamaha motor bike and asked his girlfriend Zhuzhu and another friend Haizai to join in. They name their small stall, Yamaha Fish Stall and are full of hope for their business. However, all Ah Long cares about is money and sometimes he even tricks his clients. This damages their reputation and the fish stall has to be closed. The three broke up and Zhuzhu’s mother wants her to marry a young man from Macau. Ah Long lost direction for life again and felt depressed. However, at this time, Ah Long’s competitor, Kui Mei gives Ah Long a helping hand by inviting him to join her fish stall. Kui Mei and her father’s trust makes Ah Long rethink about his past and helps him regain confidence.

The result is not an example of naive cinema but a film whose technical and aesthetic sophistication is presented with an uncloying charm.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - Africa", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and the aged", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Burkina Faso", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 950370, "name": "Heima Film", "creator_id": 24191, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950371, "name": "Les Films de L'Avenir", "creator_id": 24192, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950372, "name": "Arcadia Films", "creator_id": 24193, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950373, "name": "Pierre-Alain Meier", "creator_id": 77016, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950374, "name": "Idrissa Ouédraogo", "creator_id": 72771, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950375, "name": "Freddy Denaes", "creator_id": 77017, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950376, "name": "Michel David", "creator_id": 77018, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950377, "name": "Idrissa Ouédraogo", "creator_id": 72771, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 950369, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37824", "production_places": [{"id": 179, "name": "Unknown", "slug": "unknown"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [21428]}, {"id": 96551, "acmi_id": "504269", "title": "Ya Vamos.

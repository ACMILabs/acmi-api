For decades South Africa and black South Africans suffered at the hands of apartheid until the downfall of the white minority government. Those who perpetrated and enforced the rules of apartheid through torture, killing squads, imprisonment and death appealed for amnesty. As a compromise, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was formed on the basis that amnesty would be considered on a case by case scenario in exchange for the truth. It&#8217;s role was to mediate between perpetrators of apartheid crimes who seek amnesty for their transgressions and the victims who seek justice. This resulted in a staggering number of over 22,000 victims telling their stories to the TRC but only around 7,000 perpetrators applying for amnesty. However the fact that the TRC existed at all enabled disclosure for some of the horrific events which took place, along with the telling fact that crimes were committed by not only whites, but blacks as well. This film centres on four vastly different case histories: Amy Biehl, an American exchange student murdered in 1993 by four young black men; Fort Calata, Matthew Goniwe (black activists) and two colleagues kidnapped and murdered in 1985 by five white police; Robert McBride an ANC militant activist responsible for a car bomb blast in 1985 killing three white women; and the government sanctioned killing of seven ANC &#8220;terrorists&#8221; by police including one black policeman. Uses archival and TRC trial footage, and features interviews with victims and perpetrators and their respective families, lawyers, journalists, TRC Commissioners and Archbishop Desmond Tutu (Chairperson). Forgiveness is not always forthcoming but at least humanity and truth are able to emerge through the establishment of the TRC and perhaps allow South Africa and all South Africans to move forward. Narrated by Helen Mirren. (Awards: Grand Jury Prize, Sundance Film Festival) Includes guidance notes for educational purposes.

Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), a terminally ill motor mechanic whose lost his family to vampires; haematologist Karen (N&#8217;Bushe Wright) who carries the vampire blood but has the medical background to cure herself, and Blade (Wesley Snipes), part human and part vampire since he became infected while in his mother&#8217;s womb. Blade&#8217;s DNA holds the key to completing the Blood Tide - an event that will turn the rest of the population into vampires. Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), arch enemy of Blade and an upstart wannabe vampire (Frost became a vampire after being bitten and is not one of the pure breeds who has been a blood sucker since birth), is leading the charge to achieve Blood Tide, and he has the support of vampires to achieve it. Only 3 people stand in his way. From the opening sequence of the film that depicts a nightclub with a difference, this vibrant mixture of martial arts and rock video provides a very different take on the vampire genre. Cast also includes Donal Logue, Udo Kier and Traci Lords.

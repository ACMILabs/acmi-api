Featuring superb production values and brilliant editing, Arthur Penn&#8217;s film is an ironic exploration of the romantic roots of the counter-culture in the myths and memories of the Depression, and within Hollywood&#8217;s depictions of the &#8220;outlaw&#8221;. The film&#8217;s controversial use of violence is simultaneously brutal and liberating.

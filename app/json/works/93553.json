Meet Lina, Russian born, migrated to Canada with her family when she was 5 years old, inwardly rebellious and striving to be thought of as an adult by her family - her main aim in life is to find a boyfriend; Erin is from a middle-class family, attends private school, and wants to be a model but struggles with problems of body-image; Helen of Korean-born parents who are devout Christians and hold strict family values, is an honors student caught between two cultures; Astra, a runaway teenager, is an enigma - perceptive and articulate who considers herself a problem child, hates living by the rules and enjoys living on the edge, hanging out with druggies and ex-crims; Rhonda, brash, black and ambitious skips classes but will do anything to achieve her ambition to be an actress. From different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds, together these five young girls discuss sex, drugs, boyfriends, their future, feminism, beliefs and values, body image, and family with amazing frankness and humour. An interesting concept to see the changes in each of the girls over the year of filming. Voice and narration by Janis Lundman.

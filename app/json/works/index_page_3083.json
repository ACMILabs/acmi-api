A geographic presentation gives us not only a tapestry of the best fishing areas, but also a beautifully cinematic vision of the magnificent Southern Coastline. The Murray Valley, Coorong, Eyre and York Peninsulas, and the Spencer and Flinders Gulfs are explored, and sophisticated graphics give both an insight into the best season to fish and the species to be caught in those areas. A summary of the tourist facilities and other attractions is also presented, which makes this program the ideal guide to the coastal and freshwater recreational areas of South Australia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travel", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Fishing", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia", "Travelogue"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 774449, "name": "Keylite Productions", "creator_id": 22440, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 774450, "name": "Robert Browne", "creator_id": 22441, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37007", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [20649]}, {"id": 68733, "acmi_id": "321522", "title": "I wasn't scared", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-wasnt-scared", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Vladimir Valenta, Roman Kroitor and Giles Walker", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Based upon a fictional story of suspense and drama, this film involves two school-children who come across an unexploded World War II bomb.

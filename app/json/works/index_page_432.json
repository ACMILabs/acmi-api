Also included is a black satin headband with gold filigree buttons (some have been lost over the years) and a string of glass beads and polished stones that hang down the chest, and a cream quilted cotton under robe.<br />\nIt comes from the private collection of renowned producer Jeremy Thomas (who single handedly raised the $25million budget for the movie) and was archived after filming completed until only recently, when the Prop Store was proud to assist in sorting and cataloguing the incredible inventory under the guidance and in collaboration with Oscar-winning Costume Designer, Jim Acheson.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Colour had arrived in cinema when The Last Emperor (1987) was released but its use in costume and cinematography was Oscar-winning.

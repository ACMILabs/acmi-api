by Jabez Gadsden in 1879. The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film shows scenes of Sydney and the Blue Mountains, NSW around 1936. There are some wonderful views of Sydney&#8217;s waterways including some houses on the lower cliffs, a few bays and a glimpse of the Harbour Bridge. Whilst in the Mountains we see walkers and horseback riding.</p>\n<p>Later in the film there are scenes at an air terminal where one of the early Australian air services, the &#8216;Australian National Airways (ANA)&#8217; is operating.

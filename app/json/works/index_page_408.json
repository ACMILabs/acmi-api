It tells of Daryl&#8217;s feud with his family when he decided to live with an Aboriginal woman, the dramatic kidnapping of this woman by his brother, Daryl&#8217;s life with the Aboriginal community and the eventual bull-dozing of the camp in the 1960s to appease local Christian groups resulting in the break-up and dispersal of the almost 100 people living at the camp.

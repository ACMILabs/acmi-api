Lee Thompson&#8217;s finely crafted adaptation of Alistair MacLean&#8217;s best-selling novel. Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, David Niven, and Anthony Quayle are allied saboteurs, assigned an impossible mission - infiltrate an impregnable Nazi-held island and destroy two enormous long-range field guns that prevent the rescue of 2000 trapped British soldiers. Honoured with seven Academy Award nominations, receiving the Oscar for Best Special Effects, this film is still regarded as one of the greatest action-adventure spectacles ever produced.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-guns-of-navarone", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2353466, "name": "J Thompson", "creator_id": 25734, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q456979", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353464, "name": "Cecil F.

We see views of the harbour and skyscrapers, and a number 72 bus to Aberdeen.</p>\n<p>Originally shot on Super 8mm film</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 Double-decker buses, pedestrians, cars and trams on city street</p>\n<p>00:00:42:00 Mohan’s signage and building</p>\n<p>00:02:20:00 Buses, pedestrians and cars</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:34:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Places&nbsp;→ Hong Kong", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 984859, "name": "Maurie Fields", "creator_id": 83488, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 984860, "name": "Val Jellay", "creator_id": 84852, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "174948", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Hong Kong", "slug": "hong-kong"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1960s-1970s", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1960s-1970s"}], "labels": [57748]}, {"id": 118243, "acmi_id": "B2003908", "title": "[Maurie Fields and Val Jellay Home Movies: Reel 8]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maurie-fields-and-val-jellay-home-movies-reel-8", "creator_credit": "Maurie Fields and Val Jellay", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, Mexico and United States, c. 1960s-1970s", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>This film is a snapshot of a family holiday to the United States of America and Mexico, including a visit to the Universal Studios, San Diego SeaWorld, and to the Mexican border, Tijuana in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Some sections of this film have focus issues, as well as the occasional hair in the gate.</p>\n<p>The film opens with scenes of the Sandiego SeaWorld.

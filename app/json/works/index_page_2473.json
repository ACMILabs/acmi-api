Meanwhile, anti-semitic attitudes lead to attacks against Jewish members of the community, including Guido&#8217;s uncle. Leaping ahead five years, during World War II, Guido and Dora are married with a son Giosue. After they are imprisoned in a concentration camp, Guido goes to elaborate lengths to keep his son from understanding the truth of their situation. In Italian with English subtitles.

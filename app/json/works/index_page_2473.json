The second dance, performed by Shevanti, is typical of the dances of the north-east of India. It doesn&#8217;t tell a story, as Gopal&#8217;s dance does, but simply invokes and expresses a mood. The third dance by Rajeshwar is an example of the Kathakali or dance-drama of southern India and tells the story of bees and the lotus flower, entirely in terms of movement of his face and hands. All these dances form part of Hindu culture. The fourth dance by Chandupanikar has been preserved under Muslim influence in the north-west of India. The final dance is created from the movements of traditional classical dancing. Photographed by Keki Mistri.

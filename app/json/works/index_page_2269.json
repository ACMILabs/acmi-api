It is the story of King Herod Antipas of Judea (Hans Beirer), son of Herod the Great, who is living in unlawful union with Herodias (Astrid Varnay), the wife of his brother whom he caused to be murdered. Already tired of her, he lusts after Salome (Teresa Stratas), the daughter of Herodias by her first marriage. John the Baptist (Bernd Weikl), herald of a new era who has a great following among the people, has foretold the coming of a New Kingdom, and punishment for all sinners - focussing on the debauched life of Herod and his Court. Salome is obsessed with the prophet and upon being rebutted by him she uses her feminine wiles to ask for his head on a plate. The King acquiesces to her request and the prophet&#8217;s death signals the beginning of the downfall of a once great kingdom!</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783158, "name": "Unitel", "creator_id": 21610, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783159, "name": "Horant H.

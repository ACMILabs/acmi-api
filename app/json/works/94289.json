With a Rolls Royce engine and dual cannon/machinegun armament, it was fast and manoeuvrable, at the cutting edge of RAF fighting designs and was a key component in the struggle against Hitler&#8217;s elite force, the Luftwaffe. When Hitler started amassing a formidable aerial army, the British started to panic about possible motives and the prospect of another war, in which for the first time, the principal battles would be fought in the air. As a result, more than 23,000 Spitfires were built and it was the only Allied fighter to remain in production throughout the duration of the war.

What they discover hidden in the ground, is history itself. Switching effortlessly from the naturalism of the relationships between the youth to the grandeur of the mythic power and terror of the resolution, this short film is an exemplary example of contemporary Australian cinema.<br />\nMick is young, white and angry at the world. His sister Amy is trying to keep it all together, not an easy task when Mick seems determined to screw things up. Leroy is afraid his future holds nothing beyond this life in the mirage of a dusty field. His best mate Vance works alongside him, more interested in Amy than chipping weeds. Ruby, Leroy&#8217;s mother is the only one who notices when the uneasy sky forces the elements to merge. As a violent dust storm awakes, racial differences must be put aside as the five shelter in Leroy&#8217;s car. Australia&#8217;s history, black and white, is revealed as the storm unearths the secrets that lie beneath the surface of the land.</p>",

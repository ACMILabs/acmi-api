As the citizens of Mount Rose, Minnesota gear up for the Sarah Rose Miss Teen Princess America Pageant, the proceedings are filmed by a documentary crew, lending the film its mockumentary structure. The main contestants are Becky Leeman, whose ambitious mother runs the beauty contest and Amber Atkins, a plucky and talented working class teen who lives in a trailer park with her depressed alcoholic mother. When various contestants die in an array of mysterious circumstances Amber suspects that her life is in danger if she stays in competition.

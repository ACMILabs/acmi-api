Shaped by their creative backgrounds in film and fine art, they drew on a range of comedic influences from Postman Pat to Buster Keaton.   </p>\n<p>Playing as a naughty goose who honks, flaps and steals its way through a to-do list of minor mischief in a quaint village, the player stars in their own slapstick comedy, delighting in the chaos caused to the locals’ peaceful lives.   </p>\n<p>For a few minutes or hours, Untitled Goose Game lets you break the rules of polite society, and the joy of going rogue continues to resonate. Fans play, draw, modify, meme and reference the goose, channelling its anarchic spirit in creative new ways to make their own friends laugh all over the world.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Untitled Goose Game is developed by Australian developer House House.

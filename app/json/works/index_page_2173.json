From the sit-com parody of Mallory&#8217;s sexual abuse by her father (Rodney Dangerfield) - it comes complete with laughtrack - to the apocalyptic jail riot that cements the killers&#8217; reputations as cultural heroes, &#8220;Natural Born Killers&#8221; presents a vehement hate-letter to television and media technologies. The cast is outstanding, including Robert Downey Jr who is very funny as a sicko Australian compere of a television show that celebrates mass murder and Tommy Lee Jones as the psycho-warden of a top-security prison. &#8220;Natural Born Killers&#8221; is violent, obscene and extravagant, a rollercoaster through the media sewers of the United States. It is also a brilliant collision of filmmaking styles; with everything from music video to the avant-garde, from porn to propaganda. Features a suitably fiery soundtrack of industrial metal, punk, Arabic chants and hardcore techno. Cast also includes Robert Downey Jr., Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Influence", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Social aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in mass media", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Mass media - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social structure - United States", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 912127, "name": "Xtlan", "creator_id": 26901, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912128, "name": "New Regency Pictures", "creator_id": 72682, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912129, "name": "JD Productions", "creator_id": 79888, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912130, "name": "Jane Hamsher", "creator_id": 79889, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912131, "name": "Don Murphy", "creator_id": 79890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912132, "name": "Clayton Townsend", "creator_id": 79567, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912133, "name": "Oliver Stone", "creator_id": 53327, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 912126, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50094", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32101]}, {"id": 87603, "acmi_id": "309593", "title": "Natsik hunting", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "natsik-hunting", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Wolf Koenig, Peter Raymont and Mosha Michael", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Natsik Hunting is the story of a seal hunt.

Through her interpretive stories, Anna plays out the characters of her grandmother, mother and her father to seek out the truth in the hope of understanding her family on a more intimate and personal level - to put herself in their shoes. This journey of discovery spans several decades from early 1900s China and 1930s Hong Kong, through to 1960s suburban Sydney and into the present day. But it is the story of her mother that is particularly moving and Anna&#8217;s captivating portrayal as she reveals her mother&#8217;s inner thoughts and emotions and the tragic circumstances that became her life. This is compelling viewing, with powerful and mesmerising visuals, a haunting soundtrack, and human stories of personal history and cultural heritage, themes often used by award-winning director, Mitzi Goldman (Hatred, Snakes and ladders, Things I call mine). Cast also includes Natasha Chiew (young Anna), Natalie Tjen (teenage Anna), Eve Wang (young mother), Maggie Chung (young grandmother).

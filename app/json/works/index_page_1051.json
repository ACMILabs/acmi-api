Hungry and unable to work the mother disguises her daughter as a boy and, as a boy, she gains employment with a sympathetic shop owner. The girl, now &#8220;Osama&#8221;, is forcibly taken from the shop to be indoctrinated with other young boys into the extremist philosophy of the Taliban. Her true sex is soon discovered and her sorrowful plight leaves the viewer totally despairing. Immaculate in narrative construction and shot beautifully (even though in the most harsh of environments and subject matter) impressive first time director Barmak realises this bleak and upsetting story with an assured authority. The first feature film shot in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban. Based on a true story. Awards include winner of Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film and Special Mention at Cannes for the Camera d&#8217;Or.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Pushto", "Pushto"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Afghanistan", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Afghanistan - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Muslim women - Afghanistan", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War and society", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abused children", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abused women", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Equality - Religious aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Islamic fundamentalism - Afghanistan", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Muslim women - Afghanistan", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Taliban", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abused children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abused women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender roles in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers - Employment", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Muslim women - Afghanistan", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Afghanistan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Oppression (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Islamic fundamentalism - Afghanistan", "History&nbsp;→ Taliban", "Places&nbsp;→ Afghanistan"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2178794, "name": "Siddiq Barmak", "creator_id": 37297, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8215518", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178791, "name": "Julia Fraser", "creator_id": 81196, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178789, "name": "Julie LeBrocquy", "creator_id": 81195, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178788, "name": "Siddiq Barmak", "creator_id": 37297, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8215518", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178786, "name": "Barmak Film", "creator_id": 37296, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178785, "name": "Nihon Hoso Kyokai", "creator_id": 13056, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2178779, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2178775, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

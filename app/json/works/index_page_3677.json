By 1996 Moree was in crisis with unemployment for Aboriginals at 44% (non-Aboriginals 7%). Dick Estens, a cotton farmer whose passion for the underdog and a refusal to acknowledge or accept failure, set about with a private group of concerned citizens in establishing the AES (Aboriginal Employment Strategy).

This documentary follows the handover by Dick Estens of the leadership of the AES to the Aboriginal community and the appointment of Cathy Duncan, a young tenacious Aboriginal educator, as Chair of the AES. Together Cathy and Dick begin to inspire change in the town of Moree, bringing a new hope of reconciliation between blacks and whites, increased employment for Aboriginals and a more positive attitude and respect between the two cultures.

Its uniqueness is in the ink and paint animation technique blended with a jazzy musical comedy style and an eclectic mix of character personalities including Archy (Eddy Bracken), the philosophic newspaper journalist who after drowning himself comes back as a cockroach reincarnate; Mehitabel (Carol Channing) the sassy, indomitable and occasionally scandalous alley cat and friend of Archy&#8217;s; Big Bill (Allen Reed, Sr.) top cat and hell-bent on winning the affections of Mehitabel; and Tyrone T. Tattersall (John Carradine) the charming theatre cat who just loves to ham it up.

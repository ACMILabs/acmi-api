At Tiangui’s home, Qiuyue accidentally finds out that Tiangui’s parents are the couple that she saved years ago. She did not tell the truth to her children but chose to leave without letting anybody know.</p>\n<p>Similar to The Green Mountain of Bamboo (1982), this film also deals with young people’s free love. Traditionally in China, a couple’s marriage would be arranged by their parents. Very often, the couple would have no chance to meet with each other before their wedding day. Arranged marriage is regarded as a “feudal concept” and thus criticized by the CCP. Produced in the early 1980s, this film delivers a message to the audience that CCP members must not be corrupted by feudal ideas.

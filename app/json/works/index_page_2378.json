Libera&#8217;s political resistance leads to her exile, along with her husband, on the same island that her father (Adolfo Celi) had been sentenced for his anti Mussoilini politics. There she becomes attracted to another internee (Bekim Fehmiu) but her principles cause her to restrain her passion. After the outbreak of war, Libera&#8217;s personal vendetta against the Brown-shirts fuels her anti-fascist activism. Also stars Bruno Cirino and Philippe Leroy. Music by Enrio Morricone.

Filmed in Ireland, Canada, the United States and Italy, Part 1 contrasts the experiences of contemporary active nuns, living and working amidst poverty and crime, with the story of a young woman whose search for spirituality led her to a monastery near Rome. The film explores some of the roots of the paternalistic attitudes that have dominated the Catholic Church almost since its inception and the resultant denigration and sometimes persecution of religious women. Part 1 ends with contemporary nuns voicing their feelings about love and sexuality.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nuns", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 898418, "name": "Margaret Wescott", "creator_id": 74615, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898417, "name": "Kathleen Shannon", "creator_id": 74177, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898416, "name": "Signe Johansson", "creator_id": 76285, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898415, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 66965, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 898414, "name": "Educational Media Australia", "creator_id": 11964, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34243", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [17937]}, {"id": 65336, "acmi_id": "20926", "title": "Behind the switch", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "behind-the-switch", "creator_credit": "Neil Howe, Shan Benson and State Electricity Commission of Victoria", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1962", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Every switch is a demand for instant electricity.

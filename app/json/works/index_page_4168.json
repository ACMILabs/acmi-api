The flight recorder is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson corporation, in orbit around the KG-348 gas giant. Samuels offers Ripley a place on the Weyland-Yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the Torrens courier ship. The group arrives at Sevastopol to find the station damaged and its communications offline. They attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. </p>\n<p>While exploring Sevastopol, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo with no data and learns that the station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station&#8217;s Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, whose crew discovered the flight recorder near the LV-426 moon, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the derelict, Marlow&#8217;s wife was attacked by a facehugger. She was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien inside a remote module of the station. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module from the station with her still inside. As the module careens towards KG-348, Ripley space-jumps back to Sevastopol using a space suit. </p>\n<p>Ripley makes her way back to confront Waits, but Ricardo reveals that the station&#8217;s service androids abruptly started slaughtering the remaining crew, including Waits.

However, the systems&#8217;s defensive countermeasures kill him shortly after he opens a path for Ripley into APOLLO&#8217;s control core.

claimed to have discovered a new type of life form from a 4 billion year old piece of Martian meteorite originally found in the Antarctic which contained fossilised remains of ancient tiny creatures - posing the theory that life indeed may have existed on Mars. On the other side of the globe, Australian geologist, Dr Philippa Uwin was making her very own exciting discovery whilst analyzing some rock samples which appeared to have structures that were not mineral, but biological. These structures measured mere millionths of a millimetre - Dr Uwin named them &#8220;Nanobes&#8221;. This fascinating and informative documentary explores the discovery of the &#8220;nanobes&#8221; and the ensuing battle between Dr Uwin and the rather hostile international scientific community whose main issue was of the size of the nanobes declaring that they were too small to live. The program follows Dr Uwin and her team - microbiologist Rick Webb, palaeobiologist Tim Loy and geologist Anya Yago - along the arduous road of research and testing for proof of this new form of life, and includes interviews with allies and believers of Dr Uwin, Prof. Robert Folk (Emeritus) US geologist and Dr Olavi Kajander, Finnish biochemist (both who have made their own discoveries of nanobes and who too have suffered criticism and scepticism from the scientific community) and hard-lined sceptics such as Prof. Kenneth H. Nealson, US microbiologist. Challenging current theories on the origin of life and life on other planets and containing some spectacular digital animation and microphotography, this documentary program is excellent from both an educational and entertainment perspective.

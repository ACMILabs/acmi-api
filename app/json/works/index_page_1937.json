was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows a trip made by the &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; to the Wyperfeld National Park in northwestern Victoria. Wallace as usual focuses on the landscape, flora and fauna and in doing so, captures the arid beauty of the region. A highlight of the film is the usually hard to find malleefowl (or hen), an endangered bird in Victoria that Wallace films in its dry, inland scrub habitat.

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters. Also, the very picturesque bridge is the only identified concrete arch bridge dressed with stone remaining in service in Queensland.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected

"<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains family gatherings for birthdays and weddings as well as Christmas in 1979, a picnic in the Eastern Gardens in Geelong, a trip to Cairns and a tennis tournament in Launceston, Tasmania.

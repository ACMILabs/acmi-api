These photographs became known as the Cottingley photographs, eponymous from the village where the girls lived. This led to the often asked question, &#8220;do fairies exist?&#8221;. This event led to a nation wide search for the truth, led by two personalities of the day, Harry Houdini (Harvey Keitel), and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Peter O&#8217;Toole). Although this film is based on a true event; the existence of the photographs, the film&#8217;s ending does differ from the truth that eventuated much later. A magical tale that will enchant viewers of all ages. Cast includes Florence Hoath, Elizabeth Earl, Paul McGann and Phoebe Nicholls.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Legends", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Truth", "Biographical", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Truth", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Legends", "History&nbsp;→ Myth", "Literature&nbsp;→ Legends", "Literature&nbsp;→ Myth", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Houdini, Harry, 1874-1926"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2225419, "name": "Charles Sturridge", "creator_id": 22415, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1066169", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2225417, "name": "Bruce Davey", "creator_id": 27092, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381807", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2225416, "name": "Wendy Finerman", "creator_id": 46961, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q459177", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2225412, "name": "Anna K Productions", "creator_id": 29256, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299380", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2225406, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43696", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [26755]}, {"id": 79436, "acmi_id": "300386", "title": "Fair play", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fair-play", "creator_credit": "Susan Lambert, Janet Bell and Film Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1988", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Australian women cricketers are the undisputed world-cup cricket champions in a sport which is hotly contested by nine affiliated countries.

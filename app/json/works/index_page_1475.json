Luigi Comencini made his first feature film in 1948 and was an advocate of the Neorealist movement. However he tempered his realist approach with solid commercialism. His best (and most profitable) films include the Gina Lollobrigida showcase &#8216;Bread, Love and Dreams&#8217; (1953) and its sequels. In 1987, Comencini was the recipient of a Career Achievement award from the Venice Festival.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, writer, Luigi Comencini.<br />\nCast: Saverio Marconi, Dalila di Lazzaro, Meme Prlini, Francesco Bonelli, Carole Andre, Bernard Blier</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abandoned children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abandoned children", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2650328, "name": "Luigi Comencini", "creator_id": 78252, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q53015", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650327, "name": "Intercontinental", "creator_id": 82171, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337242", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650325, "name": "Les Films du Losange", "creator_id": 23079, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650326, "name": "Moonfleet", "creator_id": 82170, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315712", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146287", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [55144]}]}

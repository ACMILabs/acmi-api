A ground breaking production for its unique combination of seemingly disparate performance cultures, &#8220;Chushingura&#8221; was the result of detailed research into the history of Kabuki theatre and dance and consultation with contemporary practitioners of the form. In footage of rehearsals and in interviews with Bejart and the Tokyo Ballet dancers, this process is discussed along with the themes that Bejart was exploring in the preparation for and final production of the ballet, complimented by mirrored sequences depicting a Kabuki performance of the popular tale and Bejart&#8217;s ballet. This documentary was also the Grand Prix Winner of the International Emmy Awards in 1986.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet companies", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballets - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Choreography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Kabuki", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Ballet - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Japan"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 812620, "name": "Nihon Hoso Kyokai", "creator_id": 13056, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812621, "name": "Kanae Mayuzumi", "creator_id": 34419, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812622, "name": "Kiichiro Ito", "creator_id": 34420, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 812619, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50236", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [32228]}, {"id": 81698, "acmi_id": "302813", "title": "Being there", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "being-there", "creator_credit": "Lorimar Film Entertainment, United Artists Corporation, Andrew Braunsberg and Hal Ashby", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Chauncey Gardener is a feeble-minded gardener whose life is centred on watching television.

Third World governments admit polluters as they bring the promise of employment and wealth. Examines the impact on the people of Mexico City and the refinery city of Cubatao in Brazil. In both cities 45-50% of the major polluting companies are foreign and have been attracted by weak environmental legislation. In Mexico City, 20 million people, 3 million cars, 100,000 buses and thousands of trucks create an enormous pollution problem.

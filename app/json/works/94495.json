Intrigued by the processes, director Louis Malle (in what was to be his last film) decided to film the actors at rehearsal in a dilapidated theatre. As played by Wallace Shawn, the titular Vanya is an embittered keeper of a rural Russian estate; owned by the vaunted husband of his late sister, Serybryakov is an intellectual who arrives with his young, alluring wife, Yelena; this causes the protagonists, including Serybryakov&#8217;s plain, lovelorn daughter, Sonya, and the idealistic Dr Astrov, to evaluate the meaning of their lives. The results of this set-up are a powerful rendition of &#8220;Vanya&#8221;, boasting fine performances; the parred back setting allows for an accentuation on the language and cadence of the Mamet&#8217;s text, placing an emphasis on the themes that dominate &#8220;Vanya&#8221; - regret, loneliness, thwarted love and anguish.

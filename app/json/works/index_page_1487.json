It has mainstream appeal, strengthened by its dubbed English dialogue with thick American accents. The story, which follows a group of young and ambitious locals, would have struck a chord with the country&#8217;s youth population. The use of contemporary Peking as the backdrop to the story further conveys the film&#8217;s desire to situate itself within the modern world.<br />\n(4 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 11, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651136, "name": "Wang Fengkui", "creator_id": 82676, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040179", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651135, "name": "Changchun Film Studio", "creator_id": 34767, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5071736", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651143, "name": "Li Wangfang", "creator_id": 82683, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034449", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651140, "name": "Lu Liang", "creator_id": 82680, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126919", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651142, "name": "Lu Liping", "creator_id": 82682, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126474", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651144, "name": "Wang Fengkui", "creator_id": 82676, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040179", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651141, "name": "Zhong Xinghuo", "creator_id": 82681, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091171", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651139, "name": "Zhou Lijing", "creator_id": 82679, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651138, "name": "Liu Fengdi", "creator_id": 82678, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270665", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651137, "name": "Peng Mingyan", "creator_id": 82677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146453", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [55299]}, {"id": 115804, "acmi_id": "Z000065", "title": "Lovebird's nests = Yuan yang lou", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "lovebirds-nests-yuan-yang-lou", "creator_credit": "Zheng Dongtian, Beijing Film Academy, Liu Ying and Wang Peigong", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The story follows six newly-wed couples living in the same apartment block; it examines how these ordinary small families cope with their everyday lives and how they retain their ‘joie de vivre’.

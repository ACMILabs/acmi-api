The aging Baron decides to come to the rescue of a British town under siege from Turkish marauders. With this feature film Terry Gilliam (The Fisher King, Twelve monkeys, Brazil, Time bandits, Fear and loathing in Las Vegas) continues his penchant for elaborate costume drama/comedy involving expensive productions, extensive casting and complex detailed settings. The story follows Munchausen on a series of daring adventures including: ballooning to the moon, being swallowed by a whale, exploring the inside of a volcano, cheating the executioner&#8217;s axe and a date with Botticelli&#8217;s Venus. Travelling with Munchausen are the fastest man in the world, the man with the best hearing, the strongest man, a man with breath as strong as the wind and one girl who is the only person to thoroughly believe in him.

In order to remain a member of New York&#8217;s elite social circle, Lily realises she must marry a wealthy, respectable man. But finding someone who will nourish her intellect, appreciate her unconventionality and provide the funds is painstakingly difficult. The film&#8217;s most powerful scenes are those between Lily and the man she is evidently most attracted to, Lawrence Selden, who ironically is not wealthy enough to make him a suitable husband. With no job and dependent on her rich maiden aunt for a daily allowance, from whom she hopes to receive an inheritance, Lily mistakenly asks Gus Trenor for some assistance. This act of borrowing only leads to further complications, involving the cunning Mr. Rosedale, that entangle Lily and limit her options. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; charts Lily&#8217;s progressive defeat and the suffering she endures as she loses her name and, concomitantly, social respect. Alone and ostracised, Lily&#8217;s finale is a monumental passage in the film. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; is a tragic tale about a woman who tries desperately to both be true to her heart and play by society&#8217;s rules. But she can&#8217;t have both and ultimately ends up with nothing at all. New York upper class society is a character unto itself throughout his film - a conservative and rigid set of attitudes, sentiments, and values that have the power to do terrible evil.

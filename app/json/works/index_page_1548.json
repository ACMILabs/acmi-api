Judith Nelson is a genteel uptown New Yorker, devastated by the news that her husband is leaving her for another woman. The aftershocks of this event forces Judith to question her personal presumptions and life choices that lead her to this juncture. We witness Judith&#8217;s inner turmoil, coming to terms with the lie of her marriage and the challenge to find an identity, other than wife, which will enable her to relate to others. A part of Judith&#8217;s journey is the blossoming of her friendship with Pat, the elevator operator in her building who is deeply indebted to shady gamblers, estranged from his wife and facing the death of his young daughter. Judith&#8217;s financial assistance of Pat and potential romance, as well as her friendship with a sultry nightclub singer, directs her on a path that crystallises her ambitions.

The adventure begins when the president of Earth contacts Barbarella for her help in locating Durand Durand (Milo O&#8217;Shea), a young scientist who has vanished with a deadly positronic ray that contains the power to &#8220;shatter the loving union of the universe&#8221;. Her mission takes an unexpected twist after her fur-lined vessel makes a forced landing on the icy planet Lythion after being rocked by a magnetic disturbance. Barbarella soon faces a number of challenging situations that result in many costume changes, and pleasurable encounters with the handsome men who assist her as she continues to track the elusive Durand Durand. With the help of the angel, Pygar (John Phillip Law), Barbarella must infiltrate the city of SoGo and battle the Black Guards and the Great Tyrant - a sadistic seductress who wants Barbarella for her own devious purposes - to recover the devastating weapon and restore peace and order to the galaxy.

The program charts the foundation of American identity following the War of Independence and ends on the eve of the American Civil War. The dominance of neo-classicism as a style which would imbue the nation with age-old values came to rule the aesthetics behind the building of Washington, D. C. America&#8217;s first major architect, Thomas Jefferson, is profiled with sequences at his home in Monticello and The University of Virginia, both of which he designed. The capital&#8217;s monuments to George Washington and Lincoln echo the need for authority, carried through in minimalist form today by the Vietnam Memorial designed by Maya Lin. The work of the nation&#8217;s first major painters; Benjamin West, John Singleton Copley, and Charles Willson Peale is outlined and the paintings in the Capitol Building are described. Written and presented by Robert Hughes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1106514, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1106515, "name": "Time Inc", "creator_id": 14881, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1106516, "name": "James Kent", "creator_id": 78511, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1106513, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

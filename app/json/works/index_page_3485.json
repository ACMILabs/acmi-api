Once a powerful politician, Kitchen is living out his last few months in the home of his daughter Mathilda (Sheila Ballentine) and her husband Benson (Gerald Flood). Old age and onset of senility contribute to Kitchen&#8217;s rambling and reminiscing and he seems generally determined to be disagreeable with all and sundry, including his granddaughter Gloria (Marty Cruickshank) and her boyfriend, and even Bristol (Edward Judd) who has been employed by Mathilda to look after her father. The dialogue is brilliant, witty and ultimately sadly disturbing. Cast also includes Peter Machin and Michael Bangerter.

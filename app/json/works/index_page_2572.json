Rodolfo&#8217;s love for Mimi is a passionate and consuming affair which almost destroys their relationship. However love survives even in the face of hopelessness and despair. The spirit of the young Bohemian students, their gaiety and pathos masking the ensuing pain, is captured beautifully. Excellent performances by the lead singers supported by a complimentary cast including Jeffrey Mattsey, Francesco Ellero d&#8217;Artegna, Roberto Scaltriti, Guido Pasella.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>La Boheme: an opera in four scenes by Giacomo Puccini</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Giancarlo Menotti and Valiant SRL Productions</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Italy, 1989</p>", "description": "<p>Giacomo Puccini&#8217;s opera in four scenes based on the novel &#8220;Scenes de la vie de Boheme&#8221; by Henri Murger with libretto by G.

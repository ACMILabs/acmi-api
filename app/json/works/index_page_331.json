The fragments of film traverse a vast range of human experimentation with time, light, motion, and the human form. We see vocal chords at work while we hear a singer rehearsing. As if peering into the suppressed memory of cinema itself, we see an eye being excised from the socket, the slow motion movement of apes, bullets, children and cats, and the world offered back to us as a phantasmagoria of wave forms, wind patterns, lightning flashes and electrical currents. Cinema was born out of scientific endeavour and has since redefined so much of how we understand the physical and temporal properties of the world. &#8216;Film Ist&#8217; is a remarkable surrealistic report on cinema&#8217;s own memory of its mysterious role in the creation of the modern world.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:21:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["M (15+)", "Mediatheque - not for children (ACMI classified)", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1269438, "name": "LOOP TV-Video-Film", "creator_id": 7352, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1269437, "name": "Manfred Neuwirth", "creator_id": 7351, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1269434, "name": "Gustav Deutsch", "creator_id": 7349, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1269436, "name": "Dietmar Schipek", "creator_id": 73382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1269435, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "689", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 39, "name": "Austria", "slug": "austria"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [47819], "external_references": []}, {"id": 108277, "acmi_id": "B1002072", "title": "81", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "81", "creator_credit": "Stephen Burke", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Ireland, 1996", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A memory film set in Belfast in 1981 during the IRA hunger strikes which led to the death and eventual martyrdom of Bobby Sands.

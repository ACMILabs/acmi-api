Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era. The footage of the snow lodge and landscape is a good historical reflection of the architecture, furniture, and the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Title: Falls Creek 1964<br />\n00:00:18:00 Snowhaven Lodge signage on lodge wall<br />\n00:00:27:00 Exterior shot of Snowhaven Lodge<br />\n00:01:26:00 Children reading and knitting on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:03:23:00 Two people prepare to ski outside the lodge<br />\n00:03:57:00 The family have their meal on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:04:31:00 Title: NEDSA 1964<br />\n00:06:25:00 A young girl wearing ski goggles exclaims to the camera<br />\n00:06:52:00 Finishing line banner “Kastle Ski” and “Finish”<br />\n00:06:57:00 Skiers standing together with snow-covered slopes in the background<br />\n00:08:19:00 Timekeepers with stop watches and camera stand together with skiers at the end of a run.

The Donkey in this instance appears to be called “Flowery”. There is also a balloon catching game played around an above ground backyard swimming pool, and Food on a String being played using chocolate, coconut covered snowballs strung from a monkey bar. The children try to eat them without using their hands.</p>\n<p>The film also shows children playing in the street with historical cars parked alongside them. One of these cars appears to be a black Volkswagen Beetle and one appears to be a Pontiac.</p>\n<p>There are also scenes of family members fly-fishing in a dam. This dam could possibly be Rocky Valley Dam - a prime fly-fishing body of water just out of Falls Creek Victoria on the Omeo road. It is also sometimes referred to as Rocky Valley Lake and is the water storage dam for the Kiewa Valley, Victoria. Parked at this location are the family vehicles which look like a Citroen Station Wagon from the DS series and a Morris Minor.</p>\n<p>This film shows excellent examples of recreational activities, sailing dinghys and yachts, children’s party games, children’s fashion, and vehicles typical to the era.</p>\n<p>This film was made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:08:00 Mirror or Sabot boats on the beach<br />\n00:02:14:00 Mirror or Sabot boat sailing with speed boat anchored in foreground<br />\n00:04:44:00 Mirror or Sabot boat hitched to the back of a Citroen, registration number JEW 818<br />\n00:05:39:00 Children playing the Chocolate Game<br />\n00:06:28:00 Children and adults sit around and jump on a trampoline<br />\n00:06:56:00 Girl somersaults on a trampoline<br />\n00:07:17:00 Children jumping and lying around the trampoline with children performing handstands in the foreground<br />\n00:07:42:00 Dress Up relay<br />\n00:09:41:00 Lifesaver Toothpick game, lifesaver being passed from one mouth to another<br />\n00:10:14:00 Food on a String being played<br />\n00:10:52:00 Pin the tail on “Flowery” (donkey) game<br />\n00:11:57:00 Game of balloon catching<br />\n00:12:04:00 Children playing in the street with vintage cars parked alongside<br />\n00:13:53:00 Fly-fishing<br />\n00:14:52:00 Possibly a Citroen and Morris Minor at fishing location<br />\n00:15:33:00 Fly-fishing</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:15:48:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Birthdays", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parties", "History&nbsp;→ Children - Australia - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Games", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sailing", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2374642, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178642", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968-1969", "notes": "", "to_year": "1968-1969"}], "labels": [59203]}, {"id": 100495, "acmi_id": "311132", "title": "[Vacuum review.

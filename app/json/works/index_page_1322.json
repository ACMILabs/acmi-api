The main villain is The General (Mitchell Ryan), a drug dealer responsible for the death of the daughter of one of Murtaugh&#8217;s oldest friends. The General is also in charge of a deadly, militia-like gang of smugglers. Adding fuel to the fire is The General&#8217;s chief henchman, played with all stops out by Gary Busey. With the addition of seven minutes extra footage to the original movie, this version of one of the classic &#8216;buddy&#8217; movies provides new action and additional insight into the characters.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 9}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 909794, "name": "Richard Donner", "creator_id": 25363, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909793, "name": "Joel Silver", "creator_id": 69235, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909792, "name": "Richard Donner", "creator_id": 25363, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909791, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 909797, "name": "Gary Busey", "creator_id": 79355, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909796, "name": "Danny Glover", "creator_id": 79354, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909795, "name": "Mel Gibson", "creator_id": 76439, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909790, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20825, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/lethal_weapon.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "", "credit_line": "Image via themoviedb.org", "alt_text": "A black and white movie poster of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover holding guns", "width": 600, "height": 900, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47715", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [29963]}, {"id": 84109, "acmi_id": "40050", "title": "BMX Bandits", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bmx-bandits", "creator_credit": "Brian Trenchard-Smith, Paul F.

D&#8217;Arth and the 20th century eventually collide when one day he accidentally stumbles into a cinema screening of an American teen film called &#8216;Hotpants College 2&#8217;, starring the latest teen sensation Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley). D&#8217;Arth instantly becomes obsessed with Ronnie and decides to travel to the actors home in Long Island in the hope that he can meet the object of his desire. Hurt is excellent in his role as the ageing, out of touch author, and in an inspired bit of casting, Priestley&#8217;s character resonates with irony, due to his own status as the resident teen idol in the American soapie &#8216;Beverley Hills 90210&#8217;. Cast also includes Sheila Hancock, Fiona Loewi, Maury Chaykin, Gawn Grainger, Elizabeth Quinn (Awards: 1998 New York Film Critics Circle Awards for Best First Film)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Aging", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aging", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 907424, "name": "Richard Kwietniowski", "creator_id": 24648, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 907423, "name": "Christopher Zimmer", "creator_id": 78710, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 907422, "name": "Steve Clark-Hall", "creator_id": 78709, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 907421, "name": "Niche Pictures", "creator_id": 29974, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 907420, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44664", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27431]}, {"id": 83108, "acmi_id": "39019", "title": "Love and death", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "love-and-death", "creator_credit": "Woody Allen, Charles H.

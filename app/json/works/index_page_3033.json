Looking to purchase a brass set, he is met by a difficult sales assistant with an attitude, who refuses to let them look at any of the instruments. They offer to pay for them in advance, inspired to play like a &#8220;foreign brass team&#8221;. The store manager explains that starting a brass band requires skill and expertise, but they dismiss his advice. The men discover that the manager is Conductor Jin of the local Municipal Theatre. Apologetic, they ask Jin to be their mentor, offering healthy endowment, but he refuses, saying, &#8220;money can buy you instruments, but it can&#8217;t buy you music&#8221;. Despite this, Xin Tianxi proceeds to purchase the brass set.<br />\nThey head to the Town Offices to ask the Town Leader for permission. At the offices, Xin Tianxi appears to be attracted to the Township Head Miss Li, and he requests her help in starting the band. Showing her the instruments, he suggests that the band play during Town Meetings, to promote culture. Returning to the village, he distributes the instruments, and the townspeople show great excitement at the prospect of a local brass band. One young man, Lixin, is particularly eager to join the band.<br />\nAt home, we learn that Xin Tianxi is a single father to his young daughter Lanzi. His mother, who lives with him, mentions that Xin&#8217;s brother has found him a potential wife that is willing to be stepmother to Lanzi.<br />\nAt home, Lixin fervently practices the trumpet, but is upset when his father Lao Qu asks him to escort his wife Sujing to her father&#8217;s 60th birthday party on the same day as the band audition. Lao Qu explains that he has no interest in culture, and that he never attends cultural events. &#8220;I am a farmer&#8221;, he says, &#8220;I just eat, work and sleep&#8221;.

This ancient legend vividly portrays the hard life of the Saami people, their customs, many of which still exist today, and director Nils Gaup (Vanishing frontier, 1993 documentary) conveys the story in a simplistic, honest, and at times confronting way. A most compelling film. Cast also includes John Sigurd Kristensen, Helgi Skulason, Svein Scharffenberg, Inger Utsi, Nils Utsi, Anne-Marja Blind. Nominated for Best Foreign Picture in the 1987 Oscar Awards.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Sami (European people)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Scandinavia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tribes", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murderers", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Norway", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Literature&nbsp;→ Legends - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Scandinavia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 814183, "name": "Nils Gaup", "creator_id": 27244, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814182, "name": "John Jacobsen", "creator_id": 34778, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814181, "name": "Norsk Film", "creator_id": 12405, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814180, "name": "Mayco", "creator_id": 34777, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814179, "name": "Norway Film Development Company A/S", "creator_id": 34776, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50626", "production_places": [{"id": 35, "name": "Norway", "slug": "norway"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [32607]}, {"id": 91276, "acmi_id": "314373", "title": "Pathe Pictorial: The Week in pictures.

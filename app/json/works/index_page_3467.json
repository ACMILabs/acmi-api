Discusses how the popularity of monster films in the 1950&#8217;s saw the myth of Dracula being exploited in films such as Mother Riley meets the Vampire (1952), and Billy the Kid versus Dracula (1966). The resurrection of the genre came when the Hammer Studios in England revamped the story of Dracula in colour with a new leading man, Christopher Lee, in Terence Fisher&#8217;s Horror of Dracula (1958). This effectively spawned a barrage of films with vampire content, some of which actively sought to cash in on the popularity of the blaxploitation and kung-fu genres, resulting in films such as Blacula (1972) and Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires (1974).

The film opens with English real estate agent, Renfield (Dwight Frye), travelling to Transylvania to the remote castle of Count Dracula to close a deal on the rental of a London property. Succumbing to the Count&#8217;s sinister spell, Renfield returns to England on a ship loaded with coffins, where his deranged ramblings promptly cause him to be institutionalised. Dracula (Lugosi), meanwhile, sets up residence in his new home, Carfax Abbey, and begins prowling the misty night streets of London for new victims. Attempting to insinuate himself into high society, he attends the opera, where he meets Dr. Seward, the owner of the institution housing Renfield, who introduces him to his daughter, Mina, her fiance Jonathon, and Mina&#8217;s friend Lucy. Lucy quickly falls under Dracula&#8217;s dark spell, and becomes a vampire, preying on small children.

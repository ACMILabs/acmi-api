Attending his wife&#8217;s Christmas party, McClane is laying low in the bathroom when terrorists invade the building. Taking the entire staff hostage, the terrorists, lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), are depicted as intelligent, ruthless bloodletters who will stop at nothing to get millions of dollars out of the corporation. McClane is in his element (as is Willis), fighting the baddies single-handedly with one gun, some cunning plans and a dose of wry humour. &#8220;Die hard&#8221; features monstrous special effects, with exploding buildings, cars, helicopters and elevator shafts. McClane is a tough customer who terrorises the terrorists with his cheeky approach and inventive schemes. A classic David versus Goliath tale, this special edition of &#8220;Die hard&#8221; features three different theatrical trailers and an ad campaign featurette.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 913770, "name": "John McTiernan", "creator_id": 26331, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913769, "name": "Joel Silver", "creator_id": 69235, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913768, "name": "Lawrence Gordon", "creator_id": 69681, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913767, "name": "Silver Pictures", "creator_id": 840, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913766, "name": "Gordon Co", "creator_id": 26329, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913765, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 913764, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51047", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [32983]}, {"id": 84214, "acmi_id": "305518", "title": "Die hard (Captioned)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "die-hard-captioned", "creator_credit": "John McTiernan, Joel Silver, Lawrence Gordon, Silver Pictures, Gordon Co and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Bruce Willis stars as New York Detective, John McClane, newly arrived in Los Angeles to spend the Christmas holiday with his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia).

Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program&#8217;s style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie continues his &#8216;find an artist&#8217; segment and in record time finds at the Victoria Market, John Karatzus, a local Melbourne designer and painter, and co-founder of Bus Gallery. At VCA, German artist Jochen Kuhn in the exhibition &#8216;Animated film&#8217; talks about the process of painting for animation and the act of &#8216;killing&#8217; his painting to create an animation that explores process and ideas in flux. Octopus at Gertrude Contemporary Art Space, a group show curated by Charlotte Day, brings together examples of emerging and established artists who exemplify contemporary approaches to painting. Includes artists: Nadine Christensen, Shaun Gladwell, David Griggs (&#8216;Death Rated G&#8217;, &#8216;It Ain&#8217;t All That Waiko&#8217;), Simon Horsburgh (&#8216;Mumma, I Don&#8217;t Ever Want To Learn How To Speak&#8217;), Sally Mannell, Sarah Ryan, and Andrea Tu. Screetalk takes a closer look at the video work of artist Sally Mannell.

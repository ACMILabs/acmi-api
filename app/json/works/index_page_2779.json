Unbeknownst to her father, Ting Ting has fallen in love with Fong Sai Yuk (Jet Li), who defended her honour, won her heart, and earned the wrath of those he defeated in protecting her. Sai Yuk enters the contest, unaware he is duelling to win the girl he loves, and throws the fight when he mistakenly identifies a family servant as the intended bride.

One of a series of works in late twentieth century American cinema which attempted to deal with the the increasing fracturing and alienation of working class life caused by unemployment and the rationalising of both economics and ethics, &#8220;Boys Don&#8217;t Cry&#8221; resonates deeply as both a story of damaged lives as well being an inspiring challenge to conservative understandings of gender and sexuality. Hilary Swank&#8217;s performance as Brandon justifiably won her an Academy Award for Best Actress, and Sevigny&#8217;s performance is equally fine. A labour of love for director Pierce, &#8220;Boys Don&#8217;t Cry&#8221; is an exemplary work of Queer Cinema, as well as an outstanding example of the best of American independent film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996898, "name": "Kimberly Pierce", "creator_id": 80079, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q73761", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996897, "name": "Christine Vachon", "creator_id": 51131, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q436847", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996896, "name": "Eva Kolooner", "creator_id": 80078, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5415089", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996895, "name": "John Hart", "creator_id": 34636, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996894, "name": "Jeffrey Sharp", "creator_id": 80077, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6176278", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996893, "name": "Hart Sharp Entertainment", "creator_id": 80076, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996892, "name": "Killer Films", "creator_id": 71715, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50494", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32469], "external_references": [{"id": 24413, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q465646"}]}]}

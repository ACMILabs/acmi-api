Through the help of a child guidance clinic, this hostility is traced back to the source in the home life of the child where a good and well-intentioned mother has been taking out her hostility toward her mother and her husband in an over-protective attitude toward the child. The film then develops as it describes the process in which the child is helped by guidance personnel in his way to recovery. Cinematography by Peter Glushanok.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:31:10:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Stealing", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Juvenile delinquents", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Juvenile delinquents - Education", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hostility (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental health", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2036561, "name": "Irving Jacoby", "creator_id": 13185, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036560, "name": "Aram Boyajian", "creator_id": 18802, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036558, "name": "Alexander Hammid", "creator_id": 15151, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036557, "name": "Irving Jacoby", "creator_id": 13185, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036556, "name": "Affiliated Film Producers", "creator_id": 13184, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2036559, "name": "Peter Glushanok", "creator_id": 14240, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47876", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1951", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1951"}], "labels": [30115], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90404, "acmi_id": "313367", "title": "Wild life in bushland", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wild-life-in-bushland", "creator_credit": "Victorian Government Tourist Bureau and Victorian Railways", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1940", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1940-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A study of the Healesville Sanctuary for Australian native animals and birds that was originally established by Sir Colin Mackenzie in 1921 to protect injured and endangered native animals in a natural bush environment.

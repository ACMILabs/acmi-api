Written and presented by Robert Hughes.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode number 3 of Series &#8220;American visions&#8221;.<br />\nFrom majestic, primal America, stretching from the Hudson to the Rockies, there rose the idea of landscape as God&#8217;s fingerprint, invested with sacramental power. We see the immense religious and patriotic connotations which cling to American landscape painting and how, out of these, the belief in Manifest Destiny is embodied in art. Among the artists whose work Hughes covers are Thomas Cole, whose views of the Catskills and the Falls were the first to depict the American landscape as holy ground; the Hudson River School; and Frederic Church. Others include George Catlin, portraitist of Indians, and John James Audubon. The Civil War shattered the image of &#8216;nature&#8217;s nation&#8217;, but soon out of the ashes, rose the industrial future, driven by the railroad. Artists such as Albert Bierstadt and Thomas Moran, in the pay of the government and the railway bosses, departed for the West. With their massive canvasses of Yosemite and the Grand Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, they enticed tourists to follow. Early photographers accompanied these expeditions, and their pictures renewed America&#8217;s faith in its &#8216;cathedrals of nature&#8217; and its unique identity in the wilderness. However, the arrival of the urban landscape created feelings of nostalgia for a past that never was, and the myth of the West was born.

The war with all it&#8217;s horrors had a profound effect on McCrae along with the death of a close soldier friend; he penned his most famous poem after his friend&#8217;s death. McCrae was never the same after leaving the front, his health failed and he died in 1918 without knowing the outcome of the war and was buried in France. This tribute to his life and work will make people remember his life and work and to think about the poem that meant so much to the people who fought and died in that awful war.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "People&nbsp;→ McCrae, John 1872-1918", "Places&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427660, "name": "Robert Duncan", "creator_id": 76023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427659, "name": "Barbara Shearer", "creator_id": 78498, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427658, "name": "Jonathon Desbarats", "creator_id": 78497, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427657, "name": "International Documentary Television Corporation", "creator_id": 78496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427656, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427655, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43792", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26848]}, {"id": 87353, "acmi_id": "309290", "title": "Wildfire!", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wildfire", "creator_credit": "Jeff Myrow, Ronox Productions and Films Incorporated", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The tragic saga of the Wenatchee forest fire, one of history&#8217;s worst, and the heroic efforts to combat it, is documented hour-by-hour and day-by-day. 8,500 fire fighters faced the flames and dense smoke for 16 days, and bulldozers, aeroplanes and helicopters were also used.

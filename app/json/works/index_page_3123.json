The obsession takes a dangerous turn however when Freddie meets night club singer Karen (Saffron Burrows), leaving the jealous Gangster fuming and thirsty for revenge. McGuigan&#8217;s flashy visual style fetishizes this motley crew of gangsters, at times filming them in slow motion, bathing them in lush colours and filtering their violence through fractured lenses.

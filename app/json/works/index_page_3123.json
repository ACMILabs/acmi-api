The hotel is easily a metaphor for the Victorian era, a world ruled by repression. And reminiscent of Greenaway, Gross critiques this world to show the aberrances and contradictions it gives rise to. Its storybook fashion, evident in its mythical quality, eccentric characters and deep, dank secrets, ensures a heightened and colourful critique of perversions and oddities that arise from an isolated community. The performances also fit this style superbly.

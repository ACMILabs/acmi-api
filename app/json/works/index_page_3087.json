Worse still, something is making them come together in huge killer swarms and the terror of their destruction threatens to spread throughout North America. As the bees close in on Houston, Crane joins forces with General Slater (Richard Widmark) to try and stop the devastation. Filmed with an estimated 22 million bees, this doomsday epic also boasts a collection of stars including Katherine Ross, Olivia de Havilland, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Richard Chamberlain, Jose Ferrer, Patty Duke Astin, Lee Grant and Bradford Dillman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Bees", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995550, "name": "Irwin Allen", "creator_id": 85950, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q740071", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995549, "name": "Irwin Allen", "creator_id": 85950, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q740071", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995548, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49141", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [31244]}]}

Once ensconced in the wild Johnson befriends fellow mountaineers, marries a Native American woman and adopts a mute son, (the survivor of a massacre), whilst settling into family life. Johnson finds himself increasingly at odds with his original pacifist intentions and as a result of a series of incidents, is driven to murderous encounters with the native Indians. Shot in Utah the film looks spectacular and addresses issues such as the significance of the land to Native American Indians as well as depicting the settlers&#8217; endeavours to create a life in a savage physical environment. &#8220;Jeremiah Johnson&#8221; is a revisionist Western that along with &#8220;McCabe and Mrs Miller&#8221; (Altman, 1971) presents the pioneer life as a brutal and compromising struggle of humankind against nature and each other.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indians of North America", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Wilderness areas - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Wilderness survival", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Wilderness areas - United States", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Wilderness survival", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Frontier and pioneer life", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jeremiah-johnson", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1806067, "name": "Joe Wizan", "creator_id": 31226, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1691658", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962459, "name": "Sanford Productions", "creator_id": 35232, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962461, "name": "Sydney Pollack", "creator_id": 3886, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51522", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962458, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51055", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [32990], "external_references": [{"id": 509, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1325034"}, {"id": 4554, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11943"}]}]}

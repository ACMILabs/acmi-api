The story is a combination of the children&#8217;s book by Tor Seidler and illustrated by Fred Marcellino, and an elaboration on a short story pilot by Monty Spinnerratz. Isabella Noble-Rat is swept off her feet by Monty Mad-Rat Jnr. after an impressive tour of New York&#8217;s underground sewers. Her parents are against their daughter&#8217;s union with someone beneath their station, much to Isabella&#8217;s chagrin. There are bigger issues at hand however as the rat community is threatened by rising drain waters and a proposed mass extermination of the rodent community. Perhaps Isabella&#8217;s beau can save the day and impress her snooty parents at the same time.

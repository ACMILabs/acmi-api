One night he meets an elderly painter, who dies shortly afterwards whilst making love to his teenage muse, Cecilia. Intrigued by Cecilia&#8217;s hold over the artist (who painted her obsessively) Martin starts to meet Cecilia every afternoon for uncommitted sex. At first Martin is aroused by Cecilia&#8217;s bland conversation and apparent feeble-mindedness but soon Cecilia&#8217;s detachment starts to obsess him and, unable to control his burgeoning neuroses, Martin&#8217;s life spins out of control. The enigmatic Cecilia, an inscrutable and monosyllabic presence to Martin&#8217;s excessive verbiage, exacerbates his feverous (and increasingly demonic) need to penetrate her calm. But Martin&#8217;s methods to destabilise Cecilia&#8217;s mystique are sexual violence and petty torments. Kahn&#8217;s roving camera, occasionally hand-held with sudden drops in lighting, suggests a documentary rather than a drama as he explores the futility of Martin&#8217;s masochistic irrationality. As a study of sexual obsession, &#8220;L&#8217;Ennui&#8221; pays detailed if detached attention to the sex act, deliberately failing to eroticise the couplings that at times appear utterly joyless to the protagonists. But at two hours and with a cyclical narrative, this film proves, at times, quite trying. Cast includes Charles Berling and Sophie Guillemin.

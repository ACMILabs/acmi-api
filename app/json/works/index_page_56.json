Larry, long time unemployed and living on welfare, finds his professional friend Bimbo joining the ranks of the unemployed when he is retrenched. With the help of a dodgy associate, Bimbo purchases a dilapidated van and miraculously cleans it up to create the modest business enterprise of Bimbo&#8217;s Burgers. He asks his best mate Larry to work for him, and soon Larry&#8217;s daughter Diane and vegetarian son Kevin begin work with them to cater for the soccer, beach and concert crowds.

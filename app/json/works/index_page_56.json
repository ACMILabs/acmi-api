Casselman, who becomes interested in modernist art and is drawn to the concepts of Zen Buddhism, is attracted to an independent Jewish girl, despite the anti-Semitic ranting of his over-affectionate mother. As a coming-of-age drama &#8220;Going all the way&#8221; plods a fairly predictable path but manages some impressive flourishes, in particular its 1950s aesthetic, ably captured by cinematographer Bobby Bukowsk, and the performances of Jeremy Davies (Secretary, The Million dollar hotel) and Ben Affleck (Pearl Harbour, Good Will Hunting), the latter emitting appropriate charm.

The powerful figures - judge, police chief, landowner - are presented as virtual caricatures. The film takes a folkloric approach in emphasising the general at the expense of the particular in portraying Ned&#8217;s grim existence. There is something of a mixture of styles. The setting is carefully established but the camerawork is lyrical rather than observational.

Twelve year-old Yusef (Mohammad Nahhal) lives in a refugee camp with his mother and older sister. His father is in prison and his older brother is on the run from the Israeli soldiers. To escape the surrounding violence Yusef constantly lives in an imaginary world, but it is his bird hunting in the near-by countryside that allows Yusef a sense of freedom and space. It is here that Yusef meets Aida (Hana Nemah), the wild and lovely young gypsy girl from a local gypsy camp, whose beguiling eyes and smile Yusef finds hard to resist. He soon declares his love for Aida telling her he will marry her when they grow up. However Aida sets a task for Yusef before she will agree to marriage, that being he must first find three jewels missing from her grandmother&#8217;s necklace, which was brought from South America by her grandfather.

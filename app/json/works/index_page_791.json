But despite its artistic short-comings, some interpreted the film as a comment on American excesses, particularly sexual, that will be undeniably passed onto the next generation (represented by a pair of souless children, products of an incestuous and loveless relationship) who will revel even more joyously in extravagant and amoral degradation and corruption. Starring Udo Kier as Baron Frankenstein. Originally filmed in Spacevision 3-D, this is the flat version. Only loosely based on the novel by Mary Shelley, this film presents the erotic, horrific, gory and outrageous adaptation of the, by comparison, rather sweet novel. It is a cult classic enjoying a camp status similar to other Paul Morrissey films. There are zombies, silent children, incestuous relationships, necrophilia and gruesomeness set in the familiar mad scientist laboratory. A black comedy, a schlock horror. Cast includes Joe Dallesandro (Andy Warhol&#8217;s factory star), Udo Kier, Monique Van Mooren, and Arno Juerging.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Insanity", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2243931, "name": "Paul Morrissey", "creator_id": 63906, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q383764", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2243927, "name": "Andrew Braunsberg", "creator_id": 23968, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2243922, "name": "Compagnia Cinematografica Champion", "creator_id": 30851, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2243919, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

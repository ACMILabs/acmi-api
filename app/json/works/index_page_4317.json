However, it also touches a much deeper and more fundamental nerve that stretches across all barriers, that society can only function humanely if its people remember their own natural desire to love and be loved, despite the risks of pain engendered through such ventures.  With that said, viewers should not expect to be thoroughly entertained, as the film is often rather tedious and dry.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 6, 2011)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>A Fatherless village = Mei you ba ba de cun zhuang</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Lu Ping and Children&#8217;s Film Studio (China)</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1988</p>", "description": "<p>&#8220;Disaster befalling mankind is everlasting.

So is the love of human beings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film focuses on the plight of orphaned children, in this case mostly from natural disasters, and the &#8220;SOS Villages&#8221;, founded in China to provide a more nurturing environment for the traumatised young survivors.</p>\n<p>The film opens dramatically with an infant crying out for their mother, amid the destruction of a horrendous volcano eruption. This sets the scene for a collection of young boys and girls, who have been orphaned and sent to one of these  &#8220;SOS villages&#8221;, modeled on the first post-World War II institutions founded by Austrian Doctor Germanile. The village is a collection of several households, with the half-dozen children in each being watched over by a single &#8220;auntie&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The oldest and most rabid of these orphans is Pi Tao, who had to be forcibly separated from his only remaining companion, a mangy dog by the name of Huazi. He enjoys hunting birds (to eat) and is quick to brandish his knife. Living on the street has proven a hard life, and earlier abuse by his grandparents has taught him to assert himself by bullying others and attention win attention with violence.

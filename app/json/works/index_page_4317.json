What should have been a case of self-defence, Derek violently attacks and murders an African American attempting to break into his car. After spending 3 years in prison, everyone awaits his return; his gang, his violent girlfriend and his younger brother. But Derek no longer shares the same views he once embraced as a badge of honour. What follows is a race to save his Danny and his family from the violence he&#8217;d brought down on so many others.

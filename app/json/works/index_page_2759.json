In his bid to confront the sorceress and see the end to his tribe&#8217;s woes, Kirikou undertakes a perilous journey meeting an array of colourful beings and jungle creatures. The charm of the narrative is that it presents from a child&#8217;s perspective with uncomplicated views on life, unsullied by conjecture and misguided beliefs. The African village where this whimsical tale is set is abundant with colour, humour, culture and magic, with animation inspired by the earth colours and myths of Africa and imbued with a rich palette reminiscent of 19th century French painter Henri Rousseau. Music scored by Senegalese musician Youssou N&#8217;dour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa, West", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - Africa", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - France", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Myth", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fables", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Literature&nbsp;→ Myth", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa, West"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964320, "name": "Les Armateurs", "creator_id": 36671, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964321, "name": "Odec Kid Cartoons", "creator_id": 36672, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964322, "name": "Monipoly Productions", "creator_id": 36673, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964323, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964324, "name": "Didier Brunner", "creator_id": 80908, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964325, "name": "Paul Thiltges", "creator_id": 80909, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964326, "name": "Jacques Vercruyssen", "creator_id": 80910, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964327, "name": "Michel Ocelot", "creator_id": 62138, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52614", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [34115]}, {"id": 75927, "acmi_id": "013604", "title": "Kiribati?

Dedicated to Max Ophuls, Demy&#8217;s film has the circular construction, long tracking shots and frothiness to remind us of the dedicatee, but it owes as much to &#8216;On the Town&#8217; with its sailors on leave, chance encounters and fleeting love affairs. Lola, a lyrical poem to Nantes and the cabaret artiste played by Anouk Aimee, shared some of the aesthetic concerns of the New Wave (although Demy was not strictly part of it): location shooting, exhuberant mise-en-scene - especially stunning camerawork by Raoul Coutard - and love for the American cinema.&#8221; Reference: Ginette Vincendeau. &#8220;The Companion to French Cinema&#8221; London: BFI Publishing, 1995 Awards: Grand Prix de l&#8217;Academie du Cinema, 1961.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Georges de Beauregard, Carlo Ponti ; director, Jacques Demy ; writer, Jacques Demy ; photography, Raoul Coutard ; music, Marguerite Monnot, W.A.

Unfolding as a series of thirty-second vignettes, this enigmatic essay in style is characterized by a deadpan theatricality, symbolist imagery, surrealist juxtapositions and repetition of key visual motifs. Indelible images, precisely composed &#8212; a man teetering above a waterfall, a floating chair, a winking eye, a parrot against the New York skyline &#8212; are accompanied by an &#8216;architectural&#8217; sound score that includes spoken &#8216;phonetic patterns&#8217; rather than words. Fusing his surprising visual logic and rhythms with unexpected temporal manipulations, Wilson creates a work of startling wit and poetry.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1039251, "name": "Robert Wilson", "creator_id": 5221, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039254, "name": "Caroline Arrighi", "creator_id": 6452, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039255, "name": "Robert Boner", "creator_id": 6453, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039256, "name": "Film and Video Collectif and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF)", "creator_id": 6454, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1039252, "name": "Allan Lloyd", "creator_id": 73173, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1039253, "name": "Renato Berta", "creator_id": 73174, "role": "lighting", "role_id": 447, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 13524, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif003.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Still #1 from Video 50", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13525, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif002.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Still #2 from Video 50", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13526, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif001.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Still #3 from Video 50", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13527, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/robwilvidfif004.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Still #4 from Video 50", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL];

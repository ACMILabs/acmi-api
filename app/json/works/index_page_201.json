Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) heads the group of war weary men chosen to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been tragically killed in combat. Aside from the harrowing battle sequences (brilliantly shot by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) which fully realise the horrors and waste of war, Spielberg&#8217;s attempt at asking complex questions about human nature, is confused at times and morally simplistic at others. Cast includes Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Ted Danson and Dennis Farina (Awards: Winner of five 1998 Academy Awards including Best Director, Steven Spielberg, Best Cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, Best Film Editing, Michael Kahn)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Normandy (France)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Normandy (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/saving-private-ryan", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956854, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956855, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956856, "name": "Amblin Entertainment", "creator_id": 67925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956857, "name": "Mutual", "creator_id": 23389, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956858, "name": "Ian Bryce", "creator_id": 72288, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956859, "name": "Mark Gordon", "creator_id": 72383, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956860, "name": "Gary Levinsohn", "creator_id": 71381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956861, "name": "Steven Spielberg", "creator_id": 72103, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956853, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44823", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27576], "external_references": [{"id": 5317, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "857"}]}, {"id": 94654, "acmi_id": "318635", "title": "Saving Grace", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "saving-grace-dvd", "creator_credit": "Fine Line Features, Homerun Productions, Portman Entertainment Group, Mark Crowdy and Nigel Cole", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn) is a passionate gardener and housewife whose cloistered world is threatened by the sudden death of her husband.

Toshiro Mifune reprises his role as the &#8216;man with no name&#8217; from the earlier film. He is a shambling, scratching, bedraggled character described by many critics and a cross between Robin Hood and John Wayne, with a touch of Humphrey Bogart thrown in.

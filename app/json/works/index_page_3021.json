Thus, Holmes and Watson are forced to join sides again on a case involving counterfeit 5 pound notes. All is progressing well until the appearance of Holmes/Watson&#8217;s nemesis, Professor Moriaty, then Watson disappears into the canal - presumed dead, and it&#8217;s up to the oft inebriated Holmes to solve his first case, unassisted, and prove his crime solving capacity to the dubious Inspector Lestrade. Cast also includes Lysette Anthony, Jeffrey Jones and Paul Freeman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/without-a-clue", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995490, "name": "Thom Eberhardt", "creator_id": 33048, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3524807", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995489, "name": "Mark Stirdivant", "creator_id": 33047, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995488, "name": "ITC Group", "creator_id": 33046, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49074", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [31181]}, {"id": 91465, "acmi_id": "314589", "title": "Shirley Valentine", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shirley-valentine", "creator_credit": "Lewis Gilbert and Paramount Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52596, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1404361"}], "brief_description": "<p>Pauline Collins is Shirley Valentine-Bradshaw, a housewife and mother in cold dull England who dreams of adventure and stimulation.

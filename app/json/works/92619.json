For the Japanese section directors Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku pay close attention to the military manoeuvring and blunders of the campaign as well as the infighting and personal clashes within the high command. For the American section, the army is depicted as unsuspecting of an attack of this scale, hampered by limited technology and a lack of foresight.

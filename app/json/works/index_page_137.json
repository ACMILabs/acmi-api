We see Sydney Harbour and images of the Whitsundays along the way. The highlight of this film is the footage of Bali in 1939. We see Balinese people in a traditional canoe, juking or cadik, paddle alongside the ship as it arrives in Bali. Once on land, there are images of temples, rice terraces, farmers, and a Balinese market with traders plying their trade. There are local people buying food from the stallholders and busying themselves around the market and socialising. We witness a Balinese wedding ceremony and a Gamelan orchestra accompanying a performance of the Legong Dance. The film also shows dancers preparing and dressing for a Djanger Dance Performance, and a Kris dance is performed by men and children on a dirt road in Bali.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List (time codes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:00:10:00 passenger liner leaving Port of Sydney Harbour; onlookers farewelling passengers with streamers; Dalgety and Co Ltd sheds along the wharf<br />\n00:01:57:00 view from the deck of the liner of Balinese people in traditional canoe, juking, cadik  <br />\n00:02:47:00 Balinese market stalls<br />\n00:02:55:00 Balinese market crowded with local people<br />\n00:03:13:00 Balinese market stall holders trading<br />\n00:03:29:00 Balinese temple<br />\n00:03:44:00 Balinese farmer ploughs rice field with oxen<br />\n00:03:52:00 Balinese rice terrace with workers<br />\n00:04:15:00 old Balinese man stands in front of temple shrine<br />\n00:04:20:00 Balinese children and women crowd the steps of a temple<br />\n00:04:46:00 Balinese tourist guide interacts with Western tourists at a temple<br />\n00:05:01:00 two Balinese men stand overlooking a rice terrace<br />\n00:05:34:00 a Balinese wedding with wedding guests arriving on foot along a dirt road<br />\n00:05:42:00 wedding guests enter through a gate<br />\n00:05:50:00 the groom walks down the road towards the wedding<br />\n00:06:03:00 groom sits with the priest and receives blessings accompanied by various rituals and incense<br />\n00:06:32:00 Balinese man carrying a child on his hip<br />\n00:06:51:00 learning the Kris dance with Balinese men and children in the street<br />\n00:07:02:00 dirt road crowded with children and women<br />\n00:07:17:00 Gamelan Gong orchestra playing for the Legong Dance<br />\n00:07:43:00 Legong Dance Performance<br />\n00:08:52:00 women dressing and preparing for the Djanger Dance<br />\n00:09:00:00 Balinese children playing in the dirt<br />\n00:09:08:00 women preparing a dance performance – rubbing oil into their skin, putting on sarongs, wrapping fabric around their midriff<br />\n00:09:38:00 women dressing for the dance<br />\n00:09:59:00 musicians accompanying seated women dancers<br />\n00:10:07:00 seated men and women perform dance<br />\n00:10:29:00 a solo dancer enters the seated circle<br />\n00:10:46:00 dancers perform for Western tourists<br />\n00:10:54:00 masked dancer performs for Western tourists<br />\n00:11:26:00 dancer points bow and arrow at masked dancer</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This collection of home movies, originally filmed on 8mm and 16mm film, was taken between 1938 and 1956 by Orwell Michaelis.

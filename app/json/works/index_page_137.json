The soundtrack, featuring US independant punk music from bands like Circle Jerks, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag and Iggy Pop is outstanding.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ New wave music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/repo-man", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951133, "name": "Michael Nesmith Productions", "creator_id": 25226, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951134, "name": "Edge City Productions", "creator_id": 25227, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951135, "name": "Jonathan Wacks", "creator_id": 77327, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951136, "name": "Peter McCarthy", "creator_id": 25229, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951137, "name": "Alex Cox", "creator_id": 25230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951132, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39005", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [22586], "external_references": [{"id": 1870, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1280565"}, {"id": 5228, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "13820"}]}]}

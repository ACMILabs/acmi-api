In the centre of each screen a performer enacts a basic spinning action over and over, each dancer representing a different language or subculture of movement.</p>\n<p>Gladwell further pushes this internal paradox with a shift in perspective from the original work, changing the camera viewpoint from a front-on to an aerial view. The black and white negative images are projected on to screens suspended in the ceiling of the gallery, appearing as spinning astral bodies – a sparkling universe of whirling figures. There is a clear connection here to the &#8220;Planet &amp; Stars Sequence&#8221; and to&#8221;‘Parallel Forces&#8221;. Are these bodies orbiting each other? Are they aware of their relationship to a wider planetary system? Are they stationary or are they turning on a still point?</p>\n<p>The performers are training rather than performing; their focus is on repetition and rotation of movements. There is Emma Magenta, a capoeira dancer, whose roughly circular movements recall her performance in &#8220;Woolloomooloo Night&#8221; (2004). Her movements are more muscular and less centred than the tight, graceful, fluid pirouettes of Vivienne Wong, ballerina with the Australian Ballet. Anthony Lawang, a break dancer from Melbourne, performs a series of floor-based manoeuvres, transitioning from a top rock position to a backspin and a windmill, climaxing in a tight backspin, disrupting any sense of how his body is oriented spatially.

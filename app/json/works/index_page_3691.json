Prior to Hooker&#8217;s research homosexuals and lesbians endured a range of psychiatric treatment including lobotomies, aversion therapy and hormone injections to treat their &#8220;disease&#8221;. Hooker began her research in 1954, with encouragement from a gay colleague who convinced her that psychiatric definitions of sexuality had been under-researched.

Materialistic and refined Julian likes to think that he is above the seedy milieu of johns and blackmailers that inhabit his world. One night he is hired to service a woman whilst her husband watches - when she turns up dead shortly afterwards, Julian is suspected of murder. Meanwhile, Julian has become involved with Michelle Stratton, a beautiful woman unhappily married to a local senator. Michelle, who doesn&#8217;t pay for his services, is drawn to Julian, despite his occupation and seeks to assist him with his dilemma. This film in part addresses the sexual frustrations of middle-aged housewives whose husbands bore them and neglect their needs. But mostly it is an erotic thriller and a paean to the early 1980s - the clothes, music, cars and pre-AIDS hedonism.

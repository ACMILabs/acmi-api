Despite the best efforts of the oppressed poor to rebel, the aristocratic Tang family have colluded yet again with foreign devils to sell its people like cattle. But after being forced aboard a vessel bound for Sydney, the soon-to-be slaves finally recognise they must put aside their differences and work together to liberate themselves from foreign oppression.</p>\n<p>It is the 1850s, they have struck gold in Australia, and Chinese corpses are floating in the sea. Qichang&#8217;s boat is out looking for survivors. But a huge steamboat commanded by devilish foreigners storms over them, destroying their boat. The foreign vessel is captained by a certain Lord William (played by a Chinese actor), who has arrived in China on the orders of his superior to recruit workers for the mines in Australia, where they are digging it up in chunks. Lord William needs 500 coolies to go to Sydney, and has only 15 days to do it in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the sole survivor of the junk boat is Yankun, the clerk from the Shengji Company. He seems to have been traumatised and when an old man starts lighting his pipe the survivor totally freaks out, exclaiming &#8220;We were all burned alive!&#8221; From then on he runs out of the house and begins raving down the streets. Eventually he is recognised by his wife and daughter. Yankun&#8217;s wife goes for help but is weylaid by two rascals and saved just in the nick of time by the film&#8217;s hero, Jinlong. In doing this benevolent deed, however, Jinlong earns the wrath of the local heavies.</p>\n<p>Pan Rufei is called in to the office of the foreigners.Meanwhile Pan Rufei is introduced to foreigners. They discuss their plans.Fly Shark anchored in Xiamen, Pan explains theyve already sent 6000 coolies, impossible to get 500 in such a short period.</p>\n<p>The working classes can stand no more and sentiments of rebellion have begun to ferment. They make the ritual sacrifice of cock&#8217;s blood in alcohol and all drink to rise up against the Tang aristocrats. However the Tang businessmen have recruited a gang of ninjas, who rock up to the workers&#8217; secret meeting and abduct everyone. Within seconds, hundreds of ninjas have converged on the household. But all is not lost yet, as our hero Jinlong arrives on the scene and single-handedly fights them all off.</p>\n<p>He tries to avenge those abducted but is saved by a girl named Shichun who loves him for the hero that he is. She tells the tragic story of her life: A young fisherman&#8217;s daughter who is sold to a brothel at 15. After one day finding a man to marry he immediately dies, leaving her all alone without anyone in the world. Though she &#8220;forces herself to smile every day, she must swallow her tears every night&#8221;. While this encounter kindles their romance Jinlong is immediately arrested after that (Obviously, this woman has terrible luck). She refuses to let go and the ninja ruthlessly cuts of the hand of Shichun that holds on to him.</p>\n<p>The abductions continue to plague the Chinese ninja man who instigated them. In an outburst of grief, the ninja (Zhang Tianyi) tears his place apart, vowing to never take dishonest money again. But he is visited seconds later by a corrupt official who reminds him it&#8217;s the last night to meet the deadline. And to refuse means putting his family at peril. Zhang Tianyi carries out the deed, and - too little, too late - realises that his final victim was his own son, who was returning home to bring food to his father.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the abducted men are all rounded up, processed and imprisoned, branded with barcodes like cattle. They are then chained and led onto the huge ship for transportation off to Terra Incognita. While this is happening, though, all of a sudden a mysterious ghost with smoke coming from its head attacks them and steals Zhang&#8217;s son back.

The man performs moxibustion on the old woman, buys fireworks and prepares the dumplings.</p>\n<p>However, it isn&#8217;t long before their entire family and their spouses arrive. It turns out that all their children are preparing to marry powerful families and need plenty of money to organise weddings, go on study tours and bail themselves out of assorted mischief. Everything manages to pass without major conflict until that night.</p>\n<p>While a simple list would not do the film true justice, we gain an extremely realistic view of the average northern Chinese family. We watch the intricate dynamics play out as the family is forced to deal with all the issues which are often tabooed to those outside the inner circle of immediate relatives. No one can manage to keep any secrets at Spring Festival time, and the issues confronted include abortion, henpecking, spoilt kids, domestic abuse, multi-lateral cases of adultery between both sexes, father-child reconciliations: everything is out in the open everyone can abide each other somehow. But just like every New Year, there is always a breaking point.</p>\n<p>The chaos begins in earnest when they begin eating dinner. In the midst of everyone complaining over money troubles and asking for financial assistance from their empoverished parents, out of the blue, his youngest son and soon-to-be daughter-in-law whip out a huge donation box for contributions to their wedding fund. The dad snaps and tells them both to bugger off, while the other two brothers begin to fight over money. While everyone is busy shouting, the toddler grandson has become drunk off of yellow wine.</p>\n<p>Outside the doorbell rings, and a woman arrives looking for the smooth-talking son Ding. &#8220;Have mercy on my daughter!&#8221; she pleads. It turns out this feeble old woman is the mother of Ding&#8217;s piece on the side. From there everything falls apart. The whole place is trashed by the violent wife of another son, and she smashes the same mirror she smashed last year. After the storm finally settles, they all look at the mess. As they begin to sweep up the remains of the dinner the father stops them in a moment of brilliant irony:</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t clean it.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Why?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sweeping out all our fortune with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(This is a reference to a tradition of the Spring Festival where it is a taboo to throw anything out or clean anything for fear of sweeping out the good luck to be invested in the coming year).</p>\n<p>The ending of this movie is superb, with both Grandma and Grandpa high-tailing it on a sleigh, ploughing through the snow to Shenyan&#8217;s Imperial Palace, leaving the family to deal with the aftermath and inherit their &#8220;fortune&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While the film is left open ended in its conclusions, the moral seems to be that, just like every generation, the youth place constant demands on their parents until they themselves become old and realise that the only &#8220;fortune&#8221; one can gain in life is through taking responsibility for one&#8217;s own life.<br />\nDing Jiali is a famous Chinese actress, also starring in the collection&#8217;s film &#8220;Fatherless Village&#8221;.<br />\n(4 stars - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Spring festival = Guo nian</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Huang Jianzhong, Bai Zhipu, Beijing Film Studio and Hong Kong Vanho Film Company Ltd</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1991</p>", "description": "<p>This film is set in the waning years of the nuclear family.

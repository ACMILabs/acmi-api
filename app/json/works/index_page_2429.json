The stunning black and white cinematography gives the Caribbean island a magical hue and aura. But this is far from a travelogue or a mere celebration of an &#8220;exotic&#8221; locale. The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas. Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema. From the opening sequence where the camera flies across the island, to a stunning tracking shot of a man navigating his canoe through a village perched on water, to the final rousing march of the revolutionaries descending from the hills, the film is an intoxicating series of marvellous choreographed set pieces. Though Mikhail&#8217;s influences are clearly those of silent cinema, the score and soundtrack to &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is also equally powerful, experimental and emotionally rich. The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA). It is certainly florid and melodramatic but the propaganda is not hard to take - not when it is so sumptuously presented and not when, as the four narrative sequences make abundantly clear, the causes for revolution are ethically and economically justified.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>I am Cuba = Soy Cuba = Ya Kuba [DVD]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Mikhail Kalatozov, Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC) and Mosfilm</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Cuba, 1964</p>", "description": "<p>A co-production between Cuba and the Soviet Union, Mikhail Kalatozov&#8217;s &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is by turns stirring, affecting, highly entertaining and quite often experimental in execution and structure.

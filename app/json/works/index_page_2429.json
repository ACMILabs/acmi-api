Based on the tales of Chaucer, Pasolini himself plays the author who faithfully scribes the stories told to him by a group of peasants on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. Pasolini&#8217;s film manages to evoke the smells, sounds and landscapes of medieval England. Though featuring some of his regular Italian actors (Franco Citti, Laura Betti, Ninetto Davoli), Pasolini also used a large cast comprising British character actors as well as British non-actors (whose non-professional looks and carriage grace the film with an earthy beauty).

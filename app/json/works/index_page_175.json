Built during the mogul period when outrageous opulence became symbolic of one&#8217;s power, the Taj Mahal was created by the distraught emperor Shahjahan as a tribute to his beloved consort Arjumand Banu, better known as Mumtaz Mahal, after she died of complications from the birth of her fourteenth child. Using materials sourced from every corner of the globe, the Taj Mahal - which took over twenty years to build - features a stunning array of architectural forms, the origins of which are discussed in detail. The historical, artistic, and religious significance of the Taj Mahal are also examined, utilising archival material and the expertise of art historians Milo Beach and Shabita Punja.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Taj Mahal (Agra, India)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture - India", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture, Islamic", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ India - Religion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "History&nbsp;→ India - History - 1500-1765", "History&nbsp;→ Mogul Empire", "Places&nbsp;→ Taj Mahal (Agra, India)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1692965, "name": "Suzanne Duroux", "creator_id": 79450, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1692964, "name": "Barry Stoner", "creator_id": 23703, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1692963, "name": "Stoner Productions", "creator_id": 32503, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1692960, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

The history of the stone began in the seventeenth century when French merchant, Jean-Battiste Tavernier - travelling the world in search of exotic jewels - purchased a 112 carat diamond coloured an exquisite shade of blue. Tavernier sold this stone to King Louis XIV of France in 1668, who ordered it to be recut, and wore it on ceremonial occasions suspended from a ribbon. The &#8220;French Blue&#8221;, as it was now known, was reset again in 1749 for King Louis XV. During the French Revolution, the diamond was stolen during the looting of the crown jewels, and disappeared for several years before surfacing in the gem collection catalog of Henry John Hope, from whom the diamond takes its name. Following his death in 1839, the diamond passed through many hands, finally being bought by famed jeweler Pierre Cartier in 1909. Cartier showed the Hope Diamond to Mrs Evalyn Walsh McLean, an eccentric but wealthy patron, in 1910, but she disliked the setting, so Cartier had it reset, and offered it to her again. Mrs. McLean finally bought the stone, eventually having it reset as a pendant on a diamond necklace. Mrs. McLean wore the Hope diamond as a good luck charm, but was not immune from the alleged curse; her nine year old son was killed, her husband left her for another woman, the family newspaper went bankrupt, and her daughter overdosed on sleeping pills. After Mrs McLean&#8217;s death in 1947, her jewelry was sold to Harry Wintston Inc., who took the Hope diamond and sent it on a nine year goodwill tour to raise money for charitable events.

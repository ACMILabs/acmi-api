Ferrara is a master of transcending conventional genres as he proved with his bold reinvention of the vampire movie in The Addiction (1995) and his rabid cop drama Bad Lieutenant (1992). Again Ferrara manages to transcend the cliches of the gangster film as the bloody quest for revenge becomes an internal affair, leaving the mafia brothers to contemplate the nature of guilt and the futility of retribution. 1996 Venice Film Festival winner for Best Supporting Actor (Chris Penn) and the OCIC (Organisation Catholique Internationale du Cinema) Award for Abel Ferrara.

At the time however, &#8220;Driller killer&#8221; became the scapegoat for the 80s &#8216;Video nasty&#8217; hysteria, which saw the film unfairly lumped with other exploitation films such as &#8220;I spit on your grave&#8221; and &#8220;Blood sucking freaks.&#8221; Subsequently the film was either banned outright in some countries (including the UK), or severely modified for many years. Over the years however the film has enjoyed a renaissance of sorts mainly due to Ferrara&#8217;s growing reputation as a filmmaker. The grungy low budget look and punk sensibility of &#8220;Driller killer&#8221; is a perfect match for this story of a New York artist (played by Ferrara under the pseudonym Jimmy Laine) gradually driven insane. His only recourse from the insistent noise and chaos of the New York streets is to power tool anyone that gets in his way. Ferrara&#8217;s films, full of spiritual torment and redemption through bloodletting have seen the director compared to fellow New Yorker Martin Scorsese. With &#8220;Driller killer&#8221; however, its spiritual doppelganger ends up being Roman Polanski&#8217;s disturbing tale of madness, &#8220;Repulsion.&#8221; There&#8217;s even a perverse homage to the skinned rabbit from that film.

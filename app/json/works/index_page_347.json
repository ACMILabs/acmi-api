The breakup of the relationship comes about when a broadcast executive who fancies the younger woman decides to write Reid out of her key TV role. The basic thrust of the plot is the gradual development of a rapport and sympathy with Reid, in inverse ratio to the loss of respect for York. The film received an X rating on its release due to a controversial five-minute lesbian love scene.

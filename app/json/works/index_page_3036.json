In this netherworld of pain, Tom finds himself among bizarre creatures, part fur, feather, bane and flesh. To escape is fraught with danger, but to stay is fatal. Technically flawless in the evocation of its grim and apocalyptic world, this film fuses its many influences, from the Quay Brothers and Svankmajer, to the short films of Starewicz, into a superbly integrated and coherent vision of evil and innocence.

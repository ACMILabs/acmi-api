A small band of Cheyenne Indians attempt to escape from their barren Oklahoma reservation, over 1,500 treacherous miles to their own lush Wyoming lands, from which they were transported after surrendering to the army in 1877. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Colour Cinematography, this is a beautiful and powerful film that stunningly combines a profound and passionate story of the mistreatment of American Indians with some of the most magnificent and energetic Western lore ever put to the screen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cheyenne Indians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indians of North America", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Earp, Wyatt, 1848-1929", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953525, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953526, "name": "Bernard Smith", "creator_id": 62492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953527, "name": "John Ford", "creator_id": 62487, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953524, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41035", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [24547]}, {"id": 66003, "acmi_id": "001955", "title": "Chester: a portrait of a city", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "chester-a-portrait-of-a-city", "creator_credit": "Granada Television International, Jim Clark and Ray Gosling", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1970", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A sceptical young man investigates Chester - its history, architecture, institutions, day-to-day life.

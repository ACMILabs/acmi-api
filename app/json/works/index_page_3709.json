Starring Charles &#8220;Bud Tingwell &#8221; as a time travelling scientist, BTTP sends students back in time to historical Melbourne using archival footage, animation and green screen technology.<br />\nBack to the Past or &#8220;Screening Melbourne&#8221; is designed to encourage students to develop an appreciation for the art and the craft behind moving image in its many forms by developing their ability to think beyond the screen. In the program Students become actors in a sci-fi time travel film story during a blue-screen workshop that allows them to place themselves in a historical Melbourne setting, engage with a screening program featuring historical Melbourne footage and participate in a related discussion<br />\nlearn some simple editing skills while they create a digital &#8216;Melbourne travelogue&#8217;<br />\nBack to the Past aims to develop students&#8217; understanding of ways in which film-makers create screen texts to target particular audiences. Students in Years 3-4  learn about concepts related to camera use such as framing, shot types, and angles as well as some of the features of documentary and blue-screen technology.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:16:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Student films - Australia", "Animation", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 1133916, "name": "ACMI - Screen Education", "creator_id": 73686, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "program developer", "role_id": 618, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-2 Digital File; Memory Grid Pod Full Encode", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14029", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 67, "name": "Melbourne/VIC/Australia", "slug": "melbournevicaustralia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [49941], "external_references": []}, {"id": 86090, "acmi_id": "307725", "title": "Back to the future", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "back-to-the-future", "creator_credit": "Amblin Entertainment, Bob Gale, Neil Canton and Robert Zemeckis", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1985", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and Doc (Christopher Lloyd) have to save the present by going back to the future in this classic from the 1980s.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 231, "name": "Obviously the time continuum has been disrupted...again and again and again!", "description": "Eadweard Muybridge was able to capture time and play it back again creating endless time paradoxes where subjects are destined to repeat their previous actions.

When her father, Michael (Anthony La Paglia) enters their lives again, Josie confronts her mother and her Nonna about the rift between Christina and her father, and the animosity between mother and daughter to reveal secrets long since hidden. Josie must also make decisions about her future career and what her heart desires as she is torn between school captain John Barton (Matthew Newton) and public school boy Jacob (Kick Gurry). Between work, school, family and personal relationships, Josie discovers that life is filled with uncertainty and she is not the only one debilitated by the labels society ascribes.

It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes of Billy’s travels on the steamship Southern Cross, in 1960 which travelled between Australia and Europe. It is a little difficult to locate exactly where Billy visits but we can definitely see scenes of England, the Netherlands and Greece. The SS Southern Cross was a modern passenger ship built in 1955 to an innovative design which catered specifically for the tourist trade, starting a trend of ‘aft-engined’ ships, leaving more space for passengers and their needs.

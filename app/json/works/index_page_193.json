The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to Macao, China and Hong Kong in the 1960s. The quality of the film can be challenging at times (shaky, sometimes dark and damaged) but it is well worth it for scenes of the busy waterways and street life around Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and Macau.

The first segment is titled, &#8216;The Animals&#8217; and features the family pets including dogs, calves, cows and the audacious cockatoo named Ticka, at home in suburban Heathmont in Melbourne’s outer east.</p>\n<p>There are travel scenes of Narracan East, King River and the &#8216;Astor&#8217; motel at Albury where Charles takes some dramatic footage of the Hume Weir. The family were keen tennis players and visited Albury at Easter so likely took part in the Albury Tennis Association competitions.</p>\n<p>As well are some beach scenes at Point Leo, Golden Beach and Frankston where we see one of the dogs up to its neck in sand and some great examples of sixties bathing suits and sun hats.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker shows some of the great cars at the time so that we see examples of 1960s and 1970s models. A brief segment from the Moomba Festival in Melbourne shows the &#8216;Frankston by the Sea&#8217; song lyrics on one of the floats at the time.</p>\n<p>Charles also shows the family&#8217;s involvement in tennis, trying out an early model Cortina car, and celebrating &#8216;Elinor&#8217;s 21st&#8217; in white gloves and evening gowns and a display of the presents.</p>\n<p>A particular feature of the film is the footage of &#8216;Southgate Fountain&#8217; public art work by Robin Boyd (now demolished to make way for the redevelopment of Southgate on Melbourne&#8217;s Yarra river).</p>\n<p>Originally made using Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:34:00 calves up close<br />\n00:00:53:00 a calf and a dog nuzzling and playing<br />\n00:01:33:00 family pet dog and &#8216;Ticka&#8217; the cockatoo<br />\n00:02:49:00 a shivering new born calf taking first wobbly steps<br />\n00:03:19:00 Olwyn Hayes and pet dog in close-up<br />\n00:04:29:00 Ticka the pet cockatoo on a perch in the backyard<br />\n00:05:19:00 Ticka the pet cockatoo eating with family members at the kitchen table<br />\n00:05:50:00 decorated cakes for birthday and Christmas.<br />\n00:06:24:00 Olwyn and Elenor in matching dresses, likely to be home made<br />\n00:06:57:00 title card ‘Narracan East&#8217;.<br />\n00:07:32:00 family group posing for the camera on a farm tractor<br />\n00:08:18:00 Narracan Falls on the Narracan Creek in Gippsland<br />\n00:09:15:00 a scene featuring a Cortina car in the family driveway<br />\n00:10:10:00 small boy, likely to be one of the filmmakers grandsons, kicking a large coloured ball in the backyard<br />\n00:10:40:00 title card ‘King River’<br />\n00:11:02:00 younger family members toasting bread on an open fire<br />\n00:11:13:00 caravan and Falcon station wagon<br />\n00:13:19:00 younger family members putting out the hay for cattle at the family farm<br />\n00:13:33:00 younger family members enjoying a ride around the farm yard in a vintage car<br />\n00:14:46:00 a family tennis group posing together for the camera<br />\n00:15:47:00 ‘Pennant Winners 1963’ title card<br />\n00:16:39:00 ‘Pennant Winners 1964’ title card<br />\n00:18:58:00 ‘Albury Easter 1964’ title card<br />\n00:19:32:00 a Holden car parked at the weir<br />\n00:19:58:00 &#8216;Astor&#8217; Motel/Hotel<br />\n00:20:25:00 a look at inside the Astor Motel room<br />\n00:20:38:00 swimming and boating on the weir<br />\n00:24:56:00 Elenor&#8217;s 21st birthday cake<br />\n00:24:02:00 the girls of the family in a pillowfight wearing &#8216;shorty&#8217; or &#8216;babydoll&#8217; pyjamas (a style of night wear popular at the time and often handmade at home)<br />\n00:24:45:00 picnic table set for afternoon tea in shady trees<br />\n00:25:06:00 Elenor&#8217;s 21st birthday presents on display including her modelling a sleeping bag<br />\n00:25:30:00 Olwyn and Elenor modelling their formal gowns with the Dandenong Ranges in the background<br />\n00:26:59:00 &#8216;Point Leo&#8217; title card<br />\n00:27:54:00 family dog buried up to his neck in the sand<br />\n00:29:49:00 &#8216;golden Beach&#8217; title card<br />\n00:30:00:00 Ansett-ANA helicopter<br />\n00:30:15:00 roadside picnic<br />\n00:30:41:00 &#8216;Testing Camera Zoomex&#8217; title card<br />\n00:32:42:00 surfing on longboards<br />\n00:33:33:00 view across the Yarra River in Melbourne toward the now demolished (to make way for Federation Square) Gas &amp; Fuel buildings in Flinders St<br />\n00:34:14:00 &#8216;Southgate Fountain&#8217; public art work by Robin Boyd now demolished (to make way for the redevelopment of Southgate on Melbourne&#8217;s Yarra river)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Charles Hayes Home Movies: Reel 1]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Charles Hayes</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, c. 1960s</p>", "description": "<p>The Charles Hayes Home Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 8mm and 9.5mm film between the 1940s and 1970s by Charles Edward Hayes (1914–1993).

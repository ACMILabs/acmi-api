Veron has always dreamed of being in a movie and Sally is starting to dream of a film about tango. Potter&#8217;s film is divided into twelve lessons during which the two protagonists learn about each other, fight over who is leading who, start a love story, and eventually end up in Buenos Aires to learn from the tango masters. The film is shot mostly in black and white, except for some dream sequences in which Sally fantasizes about an ill-fated film project.

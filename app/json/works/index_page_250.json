The piece revolves around a mysterious notebook filled with obsessive listings of places, objects, and incidents which serve as the key to a hidden city. It is a city on unconsidered geographies and layered artefacts - the relics of low-level capitalism and the debris of countless forgotten narratives. The project stems from the filmmaker&#8217;s first job in New York - working as a pushcart vendor on Canal Street. As usual, Cohen shot in hundreds of locations using unobtrusive equipment and generally without any crew. Influenced by the work of Walter Benjamin, Cohen created &#8216;an archive of undirected shots and sounds, then set out to explore the boundary&#8217; between genres.

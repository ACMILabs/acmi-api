Werdergast reveals he has waited fifteen years for the chance to both find his wife Karen, and their daughter, and to kill Poelzig, whom he is convinced knows something about their disappearance. The sadistic Poelzig - who is also a High Priest heading a cult of devil-worshippers - decides to hold them all captive, and torments Werdergast by revealing the fate of his family. After Joan starts exhibiting some strange behaviour, it is up to Werdergast to try and save her from becoming the bride of Lucifer while seeking the opportunity to exact revenge on the man who destroyed his life. An atmospheric and chilling classic, featuring fine performances from Lugosi and Karloff in their respective roles. The concept of this film was very loosely suggested by the story &#8220;The Black Cat&#8221; by Edgar Allen Poe.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:09:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Cats", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Devil-worship", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Satanism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Devil-worship"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-black-cat-1934", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995001, "name": "Edgar G.

Featuring stand-out performances by Peter Fenton and Sacha Horler in the main roles (Horler won the AFI for Best Actress for her portrayal), &#8220;Praise&#8221; is a moving love story about the instability of love. Like the book it is based on, &#8220;Praise&#8221; features characters who may be sexually dysfunctional (Gordon ejaculates prematurely) and physically far from the Hollywood ideal (Cynthia suffers from eczema), but they are treated with respect and with affection. The film features a superb score by the Dirty Three.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse - Alcohol", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Skin - Diseases", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815283, "name": "Martha Coleman", "creator_id": 30181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 798789, "name": "Emcee Films", "creator_id": 30180, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 798791, "name": "John S.

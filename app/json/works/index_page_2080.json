Cast includes Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef and Adrienne Barbeau.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Prison films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisons", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "People&nbsp;→ Presidents", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 17}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/escape-from-ny", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995810, "name": "John Carpenter", "creator_id": 51535, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q95008", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995808, "name": "Debra Hill", "creator_id": 51524, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262102", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995809, "name": "Larry Franco", "creator_id": 26733, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q521038", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995807, "name": "AVCO Embassy Pictures", "creator_id": 51583, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49776", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31823]}, {"id": 89971, "acmi_id": "312862", "title": "Derek Jarman's Blue", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "derek-jarmans-blue", "creator_credit": "Derek Jarman, James MacKay, Takashi Asai and Basilisk Communications, Uplink", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47814, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q885594"}], "brief_description": "<p>Derek Jarman&#8217;s last film, made as he was dying from an AIDS related illness, is a devastating exploration of death and dying.

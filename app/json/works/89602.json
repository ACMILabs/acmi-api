The central characters of &#8220;Forever young,&#8221; Michael (Nicholas Gecks) and Jimmy (James Aubrey) grew up together in the late 1950s and became inseparable as teenagers in the early 1960s, spending a good deal of their time listening to rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll music and playing together in a band. Their friendship however was eventually pushed to the limits upon the arrival of a young girl on the scene. The two men, after having not seen each other for twenty years, are finally reunited - Michael has become a priest and Jimmy a university lecturer and both are seemingly overjoyed at the initial encounter. Unfortunately it is not long before the old rivalries return, only this time it is centred around a young mother and her son. The conflicts of times past emerge and personal differences begin to take over the newly revived friendship. Set in the early 1980s, the film relies on flashbacks (in b&amp;w) and some great 1960s music soundtrack to tell the story. Cast also includes Karen Archer, Alec McCowen, Liam Holt.

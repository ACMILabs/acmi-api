A group of Italian men discuss their situations since arriving in Australia, the discrimination, their inability to obtain a decent paying job no matter how skilled they are, their inadequate living conditions and lack of money and education, and the threat of deportation if their political beliefs (particularly those of socialist/communist persuasion) are too radical in the minds of the incumbent Liberal government (1978) whose politics of assimilation appear to be the driving force. Loneliness and alienation are part of daily existence amongst the migrant community, more so with the older generation as their children having been taught English at school, refuse to speak Italian at home.

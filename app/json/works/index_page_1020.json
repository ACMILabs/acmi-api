This has allowed the scene to spawn numerous meme templates. </p>\n<p>The personal element of the narrative - that your favourite song can save you from evil - and the nostalgia of the series lends itself to users contributing their own songs (and associated emotions) to the visuals, creating a personal but collective, shareable experience. </p>\n<p>Another prominent meme created from <i>Stranger Things 4</i> relies on sound. Before claiming his victims, Vecna makes them hallucinate a ticking grandfather clock (among other things) and its ominous chime (used to great effect in horror movies forever) has become an eerie indicator that he&#8217;s coming for you. Naturally, TikTokers have appropriated the sound for comedic effect. <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stranger-things-grandfather-clock\">Know Your Meme traces the first use of it to user @marcusbtv</a>, who hears it in a skit about gaming, removes one headphone and says &#8220;Nope&#8230;.. not getting me&#8221;, before going back to playing. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s now been repurposed and reused across the internet, with users often engaging with an invisible clock (they&#8217;re hallucinating) or even Big Ben.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>Stranger Things</i> has introduced Zoomers to another 80s icon: pop star Kate Bush.

Texts from police records and the artist&#8217;s enigmatic narrative prompts punctuate this essentially visual dialogue. The effects of time linger in each scene and across the entire imaginative space of this half-historical/half-mythical city that is evoked in the installation space.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve tried to conjure a place that&#8217;s haunted by persistent little pulses of history.

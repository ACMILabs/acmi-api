The man gathers the children around him and reads a story to them called “The Bear”. The film then shows us the story as it is being told. It is a tale of a young girl who is very poor, very dirty and very sad. One day she finds a toy koala which brings her great joy. Excitedly she tries to show her Koala to other school children who are playing games in the school yard. They ridicule her and throw sticks at her. She runs away and falls on the grass where she drifts off to sleep. She dreams that she is rescued by a fairy Godmother who transforms her into a very clean girl in a beautiful dress! During this sequence we see good examples of Super 8 “special effects” as the fairy works her magic on the other children, transforming them into characters in fancy dress. We see these children playing circle games and closeups of their faces. Eventually the poor girl wakes up to find a kind school boy standing over her.  He helps her to her feet, takes her hand and leads her to join his other friends. Together the group skip happily all the way to school along a country road.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of children’s fashion, games and faces.

It is a tale of a young girl who is very poor, very dirty and very sad. One day she finds a toy koala which brings her great joy. Excitedly she tries to show her Koala to other school children who are playing games in the school yard. They ridicule her and throw sticks at her. She runs away and falls on the grass where she drifts off to sleep. She dreams that she is rescued by a fairy Godmother who transforms her into a very clean girl in a beautiful dress!

We see Sydney Harbour and images of the Whitsundays along the way. The highlight of this film is the footage of Bali in 1939. We see Balinese people in a traditional canoe, juking or cadik, paddle alongside the ship as it arrives in Bali. Once on land, there are images of temples, rice terraces, farmers, and a Balinese market with traders plying their trade. There are local people buying food from the stallholders and busying themselves around the market and socialising. We witness a Balinese wedding ceremony and a Gamelan orchestra accompanying a performance of the Legong Dance. The film also shows dancers preparing and dressing for a Djanger Dance Performance, and a Kris dance is performed by men and children on a dirt road in Bali.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List (time codes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:00:10:00 passenger liner leaving Port of Sydney Harbour; onlookers farewelling passengers with streamers; Dalgety and Co Ltd sheds along the wharf<br />\n00:01:57:00 view from the deck of the liner of Balinese people in traditional canoe, juking, cadik  <br />\n00:02:47:00 Balinese market stalls<br />\n00:02:55:00 Balinese market crowded with local people<br />\n00:03:13:00 Balinese market stall holders trading<br />\n00:03:29:00 Balinese temple<br />\n00:03:44:00 Balinese farmer ploughs rice field with oxen<br />\n00:03:52:00 Balinese rice terrace with workers<br />\n00:04:15:00 old Balinese man stands in front of temple shrine<br />\n00:04:20:00 Balinese children and women crowd the steps of a temple<br />\n00:04:46:00 Balinese tourist guide interacts with Western tourists at a temple<br />\n00:05:01:00 two Balinese men stand overlooking a rice terrace<br />\n00:05:34:00 a Balinese wedding with wedding guests arriving on foot along a dirt road<br />\n00:05:42:00 wedding guests enter through a gate<br />\n00:05:50:00 the groom walks down the road towards the wedding<br />\n00:06:03:00 groom sits with the priest and receives blessings accompanied by various rituals and incense<br />\n00:06:32:00 Balinese man carrying a child on his hip<br />\n00:06:51:00 learning the Kris dance with Balinese men and children in the street<br />\n00:07:02:00 dirt road crowded with children and women<br />\n00:07:17:00 Gamelan Gong orchestra playing for the Legong Dance<br />\n00:07:43:00 Legong Dance Performance<br />\n00:08:52:00 women dressing and preparing for the Djanger Dance<br />\n00:09:00:00 Balinese children playing in the dirt<br />\n00:09:08:00 women preparing a dance performance – rubbing oil into their skin, putting on sarongs, wrapping fabric around their midriff<br />\n00:09:38:00 women dressing for the dance<br />\n00:09:59:00 musicians accompanying seated women dancers<br />\n00:10:07:00 seated men and women perform dance<br />\n00:10:29:00 a solo dancer enters the seated circle<br />\n00:10:46:00 dancers perform for Western tourists<br />\n00:10:54:00 masked dancer performs for Western tourists<br />\n00:11:26:00 dancer points bow and arrow at masked dancer</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This collection of home movies, originally filmed on 8mm and 16mm film, was taken between 1938 and 1956 by Orwell Michaelis.

We see how humans battle to survive alongside such prehistoric predatory beasts as the sabretooth cat, woolly mammoths and gigantic bears in often extreme conditions where it truly is the &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221;. Episode 1. Hunt or be hunted: Begins in prehistoric Africa 1.7 million years ago with Homo ergaster and fast-forwards a million years to Homo erectus through to the Cro-Magnons. Discusses the evolutionary process and the importance of adapting to climatic and environmental changes, of developing skills to master the art of survival and of how the discovery of fire-making played such an important role in the evolution story. Episode 2. Mastering the beasts: Follows the Cro-Magnons to America revealing their tenacity in surviving harsh elements, extreme hunger and the company of woolly mammoths. Also focuses on the Paleo-Indians of North America as two small bands come together for a ritual buffalo kill. Based on available scientific evidence, this interpretive program is highly recommended as an educational tool.

Now named Lou, he is quickly acquainted with Butch, Chief Agency Dog, who introduces him to fellow agents Peek and Sam, as well as tracing the origins of mission he is now an integral part of - Action Plan Delta. Action Plan Delta comprises of replacing the previous catnapped pet, Buddy, and guarding the Brody home from cat invasion. The cats are intent on entering the household to gain access to a serum Mr Brody has been perfecting - a serum which prevents dog allergies. In the wrong hands (paws), the serum could be reversed and create widespread dog allergies, thus allowing cats to become man&#8217;s best friend. Leader of the cat movement is a white feline with the undignified name of Mr Tinkles. When the cats infiltrate the Brody home the dogs cast a vote as to whether they should save family or formula.

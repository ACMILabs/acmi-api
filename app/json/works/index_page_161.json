The imminent fusion of spirituality with technology; flesh with machine and psychedelia with cybernetics is confidently proclaimed.</p>\n<p>Cyberdelia is a visual and aural feast with the film-makers channelling the post-modern mischief and transcendental yearnings of the ‘cyberdelic’ movement to radical stylistic effect. Stunning cyber artist works are liberally leveraged as both feature material and interstitial fodder. Low-budget analogue video editing and compositing tools are pushed to the limit while artist on-camera interviews are staged in bizarre fashion so as to maintain the feel of a ‘trip documentary’ from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Produced for broadcast on community television station RMITV, Cyberdelia stretches the boundaries of arts documentary to portray the brazen idealism and micro-processor powered creativity of these pre World Wide Web visionaries.</p>\n<p>Artists: Acid Death Bed, Misha Hollenbach, Troy Innocent (Cyber Dada), Natalie Jeremijenko, Adem Jaffers (Neuro), Jeff Jaffers (Third Eye), Dale Nason (Cyber Dada), Ollie Olsen (Third Eye) Captain ROM, Stelarc, Gus Till (Third Eye), Julian Wong, Christopher Wright and Max Q.</p>\n<p>Cyberdelia was generously donated to ACMI by Cyberdelia Productions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Steve Spangaro, director<br />\nMike Collins, associate director<br />\nMilena Romanin, production manager<br />\nSusan King, interviews and research<br />\nBased on an original concept by Adem Jaffers</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation&nbsp;→ 2-D computer animation", "Digital Art", "Documentary", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Experimental", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1230024, "name": "Steve Spangaro", "creator_id": 8791, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1230023, "name": "Milena Romanin", "creator_id": 84862, "role": "production manager", "role_id": 934, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230022, "name": "Mike Collins", "creator_id": 81894, "role": "associate director", "role_id": 594, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230021, "name": "Adem Jaffers", "creator_id": 81893, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230020, "name": "Adem Jaffers", "creator_id": 81893, "role": "original concept", "role_id": 593, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230019, "name": "Susan King", "creator_id": 84861, "role": "researcher", "role_id": 950, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference -

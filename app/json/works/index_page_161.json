The powerful figures - judge, police chief, landowner - are presented as virtual caricatures. The film takes a folkloric approach in emphasising the general at the expense of the particular in portraying Ned&#8217;s grim existence. There is something of a mixture of styles. The setting is carefully established but the camerawork is lyrical rather than observational.

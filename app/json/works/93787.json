In a contemporary conversation with John Faulkner, Whitlam discusses his history in politics during the 1950s, 60s and 70s - tumultuous times for Australia that saw immense social changes. Galvanised by the conservatism of the 1940s Whitlam joined the Labor Party, determined to deliver better community resources, such as hospitals and schools. Whitlam, an interesting and engaging speaker, with incredible powers of recall, discusses: conscription and Australian involvement in the Vietnam War; championing of equal pay for women; introduction of land rights for Aboriginals; liberalisation of immigration laws; Racial Discrimination Act; and founding the National Gallery of Canberra. Always a controversial figure, Whitlam was at times ridiculed and dogged by scandals and here he defends his role in Indonesia&#8217;s takeover of East Timor 1975. Covers in detail the double dissolution of 1974 and his dismissal by Governor General William Kerr. Whilst this documentary is thorough in its presentation of the issues and complexities of government, parliament and politics in Australia, interviewer John Faulkner seems at times sycophantic in his approach, compromising any impartiality.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Gough Whitlam: in his own words [Widescreen] (A)</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Robert Francis, Interpares and Film Finance Corporation Australia</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2002</p>", "description": "<p>This documentary opens with archival footage of Gough Whitlam&#8217;s 1972 election victory, campaigned under the now iconic slogan &#8220;It&#8217;s time&#8221;, which saw the end of a 23-year run in Australia of Liberal Federal government rule.

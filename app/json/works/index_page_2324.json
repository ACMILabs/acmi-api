When the two of them meet at Buck&#8217;s mother&#8217;s funeral, Buck decides to follow his old friend to LA. But Chuck, now engaged and a professional, has little time for the nostalgic games that Buck wants to play.

But increasingly, as his stalking of Chuck becomes obsessive and malignant, a darker tone appears in this film. Childhood games are revealed to be far from innocent: Buck wants to return to the playfulness of their sexual exploration when they were adolescent boys; but Chuck is fearful of the unresolved tensions and consequences of this early experimentation.

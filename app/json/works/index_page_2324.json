Shortly after September 11 2001, Syrian born Rana Kabbani, returned to the Middle East to find out how Muslims have come to view the United States. Her journey took her to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. She wanted to know why there was so much hatred towards America. Was it religious - Muslims against Christians - or were there other reasons for this apparent hatred? And yet for all the hatred and anger towards America, many Arabs expressed sympathy for the American people and made it clear that they did not condone terrorism or what occurred on September 11. The United States however is accused of interference and domination, hypocrisy and double standards, exploiting the Middle East for its oil and using their land for its military bases - 27,000 American military personnel are currently based in the desert of Egypt. This documentary presents a Muslim perspective from the street Arabs to the intelligentsia and includes interviews with Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Youssef (&#8220;The Storm&#8221;), Iraqui musician Naseer Shamma, Palestinian journalist Atef Helwa, Sheik Nahyan one of the ruling elite in the United Arab Emirates, various academics and and a group of American Christian students on a study tour of the Middle East.

Alcoholic screenwriter Ben, (Nicholas Cage) having lost his wife, child and now his job heads to Las Vegas on a mission to drink himself to death. He picks up prostitute Sera (Elizabeth Shue), they share a night together, numerous drinks and form a semblance of a relationship. She is aware of his mission, his lack of commitment and his love for alcohol which may surpass that of his feelings for her, but desperately clings to him for companionship. They form a relationship on the agreement that she will not ask him to stop drinking. The film is clouded by the halo of Ben&#8217;s alcoholism and Sera&#8217;s unhappy situation, but is lifted by the strange tenderness they share. Also starring Julian Sands and Richard Lewis.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/leaving-las-vegas", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1990997, "name": "Mike Figgis", "creator_id": 63878, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q710131", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990996, "name": "Anne Stewart", "creator_id": 78315, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036611", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990995, "name": "Lila Cazès", "creator_id": 78314, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036415", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990994, "name": "Initial Productions (US)", "creator_id": 26144, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121058098", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1990993, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42901", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [26161]}, {"id": 97943, "acmi_id": "507268", "title": "La Jetee", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-jetee", "creator_credit": "Chris Marker and Andre Heinrich", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 24158, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q451434"}], "brief_description": "<p>Set in Paris after the Third World War; an imprisoned man is being used by scientists to investigate time travel.

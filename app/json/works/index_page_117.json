Inspired by Marcel Proust&#8217;s &#8220;The Prisoner&#8221; (the fifth volume of &#8220;Remembrance of Things Past&#8221;), &#8220;La Captive&#8221; centres on Simon (Stanislas Merhar), a handsome, wealthy, young man, who lives in an opulent multi-levelled apartment with his grandmother, a maid, and Ariane (Sylvie Testud), his girlfriend and willing &#8216;captive&#8217;. We first see Simon stalking Ariane as she runs an errand, it gradually becomes apparent that he is compelled to control her every movement, to the point where he forcibly removes her from social gatherings and orders her how to bathe and when to join him in bed. Inflaming Simon&#8217;s suspicion and anxiety is Ariane&#8217;s close connection to a circle of women friends, especially, the beautiful, Andree (Olivia Bonamy), with whom she spends a lot of time. Increasingly distressed, Simon decides to terminate their relationship and drives Ariane to a grand seaside hotel for a final, tragic night together. Exactly why Ariane submits to Simon&#8217;s control remains largely unexplained. True to Akerman&#8217;s abstract, minimalist style, such &#8216;story&#8217; details or emotional content are kept at bay to enable a more philosophical exploration of ideas of obsession, male-female vs. female-female relations, and the relation between control and desire. Akerman expertly fine-tunes story tension via rhythm, shot composition and her signature austere, elegant style. With more then a hint of Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;Vertigo&#8221;, Bresson&#8217;s &#8220;Une Femme Douce&#8221;, and Antonioni&#8217;s &#8220;L&#8217;Avenntura&#8221;, &#8220;La Captive&#8221; is a seminal film that questions the very possibility of an open and humane relationship between a man and woman.

Reflecting a tortuous relationship to both his Catholicism and his love of the Hollywood genre, Ferrara&#8217;s films involve characters immersed in darkly amoral worlds. Kathleen&#8217;s ethical and political attempts to counter evil are constantly undermined by her very body and instincts which propel her towards savagery and violence. Ferrara&#8217;s assured direction means that &#8220;The Addiction&#8221; works effectively as a horror film but its real power arises from daring to address the combative relationship between rationality and instinct in the human psyche. Cast also includes Christopher Walken.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Postmodernism", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Postmodernism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Existentialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ College environment", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-addiction", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1973565, "name": "Abel Ferrara", "creator_id": 29983, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973564, "name": "Fernando Sulichin", "creator_id": 53339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973563, "name": "Denis Hann", "creator_id": 79831, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973562, "name": "October Films", "creator_id": 53950, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973561, "name": "Fast Films", "creator_id": 34066, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49938", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [31956], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92465, "acmi_id": "315746", "title": "All the pretty horses", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "all-the-pretty-horses-dvd", "creator_credit": "Billy Bob Thornton, Robert Salerno, Miramax Films and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>John Grady Cole (Matt Damon) and his friend Lacey Rawlins (Henry Thomas) are young Texan men dreaming of an exciting life as cowboys.

Dazzled by his social mobility and wealth, Miranda is soon betrothed to the faintly menacing Nicholas, but the marriage becomes wretched as Nicholas&#8217; true nature is revealed. Shades of &#8220;Rebecca&#8221; (1940) hang over this mystery drama, but the Hitcockian tones are diluted in favour of a more romantic tone. What remains is an engaging, and at times suspenseful, murder mystery. Directorial debut of screenwriter and producer Joseph L.

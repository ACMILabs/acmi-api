Accatone is a young pimp who lives off the earnings of his young &#8220;girl.&#8221; When she is imprisoned, he meets the virginal Stella but their attempts to escape the harsh existence of poverty and prostitution prove fruitless in a world of relentless economic and social exploitation. Pasolini used non-professional actors recruited from the Roman slums to play the lead roles, including a young Franco Citti in the role of Accatone. Though firmly influenced by the aesthetics of neo-realism, the film frames the proletariat characters in a fatalistic and stylised milieu which prefigures the radical mannerist cinema Pasolini was to create in the late sixties. On its release &#8220;Accatone&#8221; was to prove controversial with moralists of both the left and right and was the beginning of Pasolini&#8217;s battles with international censors. Bernardo Bertolucci was assistant director on the film.

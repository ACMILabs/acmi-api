The challenge when watching this highly stylised movie is to determine who is telling the truth and who is telling brilliant lies.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Truth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Truth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954727, "name": "Richard Franklin", "creator_id": 23220, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954726, "name": "Bayside Pictures", "creator_id": 27174, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954725, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18338, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/fMVhQqYRlCDv0Psg97T8Pv9yyG6.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Brilliant lies (Richard Franklin) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 960, "height": 1440, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41992", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [25421]}, {"id": 87083, "acmi_id": "43481", "title": "Brilliant gardens", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "brilliant-gardens", "creator_credit": "Nigel Farrell, Tadpole Lane and Botanical Gardens Conservation International", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Let Rula Lenska lead you on a magical journey through 8 beautiful botanic gardens in Britain from places such as Kew, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Chelsea, Westonbirt, Glasgow, Ness and Wisley.

Miller was a visionary who introduced swing music to American audiences in the 1940s with his own original compositions. Starting in the 1930s &#8220;The Glen Miller story&#8221; tracks Miller&#8217;s struggles to have his arrangements played when the mood of the day was for the standards only. Miller was a talented trombonist who was driven by a love of music to champion the case for a new style of writing. The film also tells the story of Miller wooing his teenage sweetheart, whom he eventually marries. Helen (June Allyson) frequently played second fiddle to Miller&#8217;s ambitions, even spending her wedding night at a club whilst Miller jammed with Louis Armstrong. The film features many musicians of the era playing themselves which greatly enhances its appeal. Musicians include: Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa, Barney Biggard, Arvell Shaw and Frances Langford. &#8220;The Glenn Miller story&#8221; was one of the most successful bio-pics of its day.

In 1992 a conference was held between the ruling National Party and the ANC to negotiate towards a free and fair election. Tentative agreement was reached. A further summit was held in April 1993 at the World Trade Centre near Johannesburg and finally it was agreed that the new Government would be formed on a power-sharing basis for five years, ie the National Party and the ANC and that the Cabinet, with its majority, freely able to make decisions without interference or vetoing from the minority National Party. The election date was set for April 1994. This decision angered the right-winged Afrikaners, particularly Eugene Terre&#8217;Blanche an extremist and eventual leader of the AWB (Afrikaner Resistance Movement). An alliance of 20 right-winged Afrikaner movements including AWB was formed and became known as the &#8220;Volksfront&#8221;. Their aim - a separate white state. At the same time, some of the 14 black tribal states (all of which would be abolished after the elections), along with the Zulu Inkatha movement, also fiercely opposed the ANC/National Party alliance and the months preceding the election saw once again violent attacks and demonstrations. It would be this strange alliance between the white Afrikaners and the black right-winged movements that would eventually bring their own downfall and pave the way for a democratic election to take place on 27 April 1994. On 10 May 1994 Nelson Mandela became the inaugural first President of Democratic South Africa with the ANC polling 63% of the vote, National Party 20% and Inkatha 10%.

In place of a mundane and prosaic record of national teams competing in a succession of events, Ichikawa takes the occasion to stay in close with selected individuals, winners and losers, striving to overcome their limitations. As in Riefenstahl&#8217;s film the climax is the marathon, here presented as a tribute to, rather than a celebration of individual effort. A phenomenally successful film upon its theatrical release, Ichikawa illustrates that a search for human understanding sometimes presents insurmountable difficulties, sometimes there is room for optimism, but more often the ironic truth is that a gold medal provides no answer to the problems of living.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Japan", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Olympic Games (18th : 1964 : Tokyo, Japan)", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Olympics", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960651, "name": "13th Olympic Games Organising Committee", "creator_id": 34079, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960653, "name": "Suketaro Taguchi", "creator_id": 34080, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960654, "name": "Kon Ichikawa", "creator_id": 72065, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960652, "name": "Toho Kabushiki Kaisha", "creator_id": 22350, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49948", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [31964], "external_references": [{"id": 6459, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "43618"}]}]}

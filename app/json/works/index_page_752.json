Narrated by John Morgan.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode number 5 of Series &#8220;The Celts&#8221;.<br />\nThe fifth in a six part series that discusses the history and legends of the Celtic people of Early Europe through to the year 2000. Using paintings, historical locations, buildings and re-enactments, this episode spans the 8th century through to the 17th century, recounting the wars, invasions, and the blood spilt in the name of the Church and a &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221;. The story begins with the Viking invasion in 793 AD on the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne where the complex web of Celtic Churches were savagely attacked and destroyed. This invasion, occupation and settlement, continued on through the years to 1066 and the Battle of Hastings when William, Duke of Normandy, defeated Harold II, and took the English throne heralding the beginning of a mass takeover by the Normans. Over time, the Celtic culture was almost absorbed and reality and truth lost its way as in the legend of King Arthur - the myth lives on even today. The continual assault on the Celtic communities by the English led to turmoil and revolt during the 1300s, with Scotland seemingly the only one to retain its independence through the emergence of William Wallace and then Robert Bruce. By 1532 AD, Brittany was defeated and absorbed into France, and in 1536 Wales became part of England. Under the reign of Elizabeth I (1550-1600 AD), Ireland fell fully under English rule and so began the &#8220;Irish problem&#8221;. From 1608 onwards, &#8220;plantations&#8221; began in Ireland whereby Protestant English and Scottish were encouraged to settle in Ireland and try and rid Ireland of its Catholic population. This very detailed and informative documentary provides a historical insight into the Celts and their culture and is complimented by some stunning landscape cinematography.

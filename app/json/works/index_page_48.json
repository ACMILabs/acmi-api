&#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. During the last century, theatre was challenged by mass entertainment in the form of cinema, television and the internet. The one thing that has made theatre stand apart is its quality of being &#8220;live&#8221;, allowing an immediate interaction between actors and audience. In this program, Richard Eyre explores how theatre has survived and why it will continue to survive - from the influences of Antonin Artaud&#8217;s &#8220;theatre of cruelty&#8221;, to the commercial popular culture of the blockbuster musicals, to the experimental and avant-garde. He takes us into the 1980s and 90s through discussion, interviews and excerpts, analysing the commercialisation of theatre; the audience; the fusion of traditional theatre with multimedia technology such as robotics, puppetry and film; the construction and reconstruction of theatres, eg the National Theatre, the Olivier Theatre and the Globe Theatre. Eyre argues &#8220;that in order to survive, theatre must be more intense and more powerful than ordinary life&#8221;. Through interviews with playwrights, directors and actors including Robert Lepage (Needles and opium, 1993, Elsinore, 1997), Peter Brook (Marat Sade, 1966, In the act), Trevor Nunn (Les Miserables), Tony Kushner (Angels in America, 1993), Julie Taymor (The Lion king), Hal Prince, Stephen Daldry, Steven Berkoff, Deborah Warner, Tom Stoppard, and others, the question of where the stage of tomorrow is headed is discussed and debated.

stages&#8221;.<br />\nFifth episode in the six-part series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. The aftermath of WW II influenced the direction of theatre and allowed a whole new generation of playwrights the freedom to express their anger, their political allegiance, social realism and an attitude that you could do or say what you want on stage - theatre became the instrument of social change. However, it was first German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), then Irish born Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) who inspired the 1960s and 70s generation of playwrights. Brecht, a communist, was known as a &#8220;theorist about theatre&#8221; who challenged the traditional values of theatre creating experimental and revolutionary works around his theory of alienation, promoting a style of acting and staging that created a distancing effect. Samuel Beckett was the man of evocative language, his plays often shrouded in despair and bleakness, combined with a lacing of caustic humor and left-wing politics. Richard Eyre presents indepth biographical backgrounds of each of these playwrights, including excerpts from their plays &#8220;The Resistible rise of Arturo Ui&#8221; and &#8220;Galileo&#8221; (Brecht), and &#8220;Waiting for Godot&#8221; (Beckett). Also features playwrights Edward Bond, Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill, David Hare, Alan Bennett, Tom Stoppard and others along with film clips, excerpts and interviews. In addition, the program provides an historical overview of Britain during the 60s and 70s, the political and sexual freedom and the social mores of a society in the throes of a revolution - in fact, the whole world seemed to be in a state of protest in 1968. Follows through to the 1970s, to 1979 and the beginning of Thatcherism in Britain.

"brief_description": "<p>Episode number 4 of Series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;.<br />\nFourth episode in the six-part series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. In this program we travel back to Britain to a time when British theatre entertained in a fanciful, somewhat straight-laced puritanical manner, appealing to the middle and upper classes through wit and satire. A time during the 1920s and 1930s between the two wars when the audience did not want to be faced with reality and socio-political themes. However, playwrights Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan, through the Royal Court and Comedy Theatres (which were turned into clubs in order to present plays that were banned by the Official Censor, usually for their sexual connotations - homosexuality was considered a &#8220;dirty&#8221; word in those days), entertained and delighted audiences in the West End with plays such as &#8220;The Vortex&#8221;, &#8220;Private lives&#8221; (Coward) and &#8220;The Deep blue sea&#8221; and &#8220;Separate tables&#8221; (Rattigan). Rattigan&#8217;s plays characteristically expressed repressed emotions and hidden sexual desires smouldering beneath the surface whereas Coward was more out there, hamming it up in such a decadent way as to tease but not shock or disgust his audience. In contrast, following WWII the likes of Rodney Ackland (&#8220;The Pink room&#8221; 1952), John Osborne (&#8220;Look back in anger&#8221; 1956), Brendan Behan (&#8220;The Quare fellow&#8221; 1956) and Shelagh Delaney (&#8220;A Taste of honey&#8221; 1958) delivered reality and working class attitudes, sexuality and politics in raw and often confronting language taking British theatre in the 1950s on a revolutionary course. John Osborne, known as the &#8220;angry young man&#8221;, sparked off a whole generation of &#8220;angry young men&#8221; and a slew of social realist productions but it was the foresight and collaboration of people such as George Devine (Royal Court Theatre manager/producer) and Joan Littlewood (founder of the Theatre Workshop) who guided, supported and propelled the young British playwrights into the limelight and their plays on to the stage. Features excerpts and interviews with actors, playwrights, directors including Alan Bates, John Osborne, Arthur Miller, Peter Hall, Noel Coward, Harold Pinter, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Rodney Ackland, Joan Littlewood, Brendan Behan, Tom Stoppard and others.

Whilst Britain was staging its satirical and often light-hearted societal plays in the decades leading up to the 50s, American theatre had grown, changed and developed its own unique style mirroring the mood and social changes of the time. In this episode, Richard Eyre takes us on that historical journey from Provincetown in 1916 where New York writers, poets, playwrights and political activists from Greenwich Village gathered together in small beach shacks exchanging ideas, philosophising, and creating serious political and social works, through to Broadway and New Orleans and the golden age of musicals, vaudevilles, burlesque and finally to Hollywood and the 1950s. Explores the effect and influence on American theatre and American playwrights through the Great Depression, two world wars, McCarthyism, the elusive &#8220;American dream&#8221; and the collision of race and cultures, and features biographical essays on Eugene O&#8217;Neil, Clifford Odets, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Lorraine Hansberry. Through film excerpts and stills, including &#8220;The Iceman cometh&#8221; and &#8220;A Long day&#8217;s journey into night&#8221; (O&#8217;Neil); &#8220;Waiting for Lefty&#8221; and &#8220;Awake and sing&#8221; (Odets); &#8220;Death of a salesman&#8221; and &#8220;The Crucible&#8221; (Miller); &#8220;A Streetcar named desire&#8221; and &#8220;The Glass menagerie&#8221; (Williams); &#8220;A Raisin in the sun&#8221; (Hansberry) Eyre demonstrates the contribution and impact each of these playwrights made on the American psyche. Eyre also discusses the birth of the American musical, composer Richard Rodgers and lyricists Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein and the important place this art form has in American culture.

&#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. This program focuses on Ireland and some of the Irish playwrights who gave birth to a new kind of theatre, one that had more substance than the 19th century Victorian melodrama and moralising society plays which were being performed in Britain, most significantly, at a time when Ireland was fighting for independence from British empirical connections. Richard Eyre discusses in great detail the influences and historical background of several Irish playwrights including William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Sean O&#8217;Casey, and J.M. Synge and the part these individuals played in the establishment of a national theatre and a national identity for Ireland. Yeats, Shaw and Wilde were all born in Dublin around the same time, but Shaw and Wilde very early on exiled themselves to England to make their fame and fortune through satirising the English high society. In contrast, against a background of political turmoil and tension, Yeats, in collaboration with Lady Augusta Gregory, conceived The Abbey Theatre which was to become Ireland&#8217;s national theatre and a stage for the works of Sean O&#8217;Casey and J.M. Synge, both playwrights who shared the belief that plays could be about contemporary events and the reality of people&#8217;s lives.

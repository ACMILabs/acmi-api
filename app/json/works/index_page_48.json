Cast includes Josef Sommer, Lukas Haas, Jan Rubes, Alexander Godunov, Patti Lupone, Danny Glover and Brent Jennings.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "German", "German", "Hungarian", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Amish", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Amish"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/witness", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960600, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960601, "name": "Edward S.

The original screenplay (by director Kenneth Lonergan) veers away from cliche and pat conclusions, imbuing the characters with a realistic quality. Sammy and Terry are orphaned at a young age when their parents are killed in a car accident. As adults, the siblings are estranged, having made divergent choices. Sammy is a single parent with an eight-year-old son, Rudy, living in the house she was brought up in, working in a bank. She lives by a strict moral code, bound by religion and duty, but is entirely capable of hypocrisy and self-delusion. Terry, by contrast, is a wild loner, full of rage, self-destructive by nature but charming in his own humorous way. He doesn&#8217;t believe in Sammy&#8217;s ordered conservative life and inadvertently challenges this, creating chaos with his presence. It is Terry and Rudy&#8217;s strengthening relationship that acts as a catalyst, causing an irrevocable torrent of truths that upend the family dynamics.

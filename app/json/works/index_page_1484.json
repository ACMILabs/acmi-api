He suggests she use her men like an army general would and that she has no sense of leadership. In the next game, without a leader one of the players feigns an injury and for the first time in a long time they lose a match. They are too disinterested to care about this result. Bu Lan officially resigns as sports leader. The team begin to feel bad and visit the depressed Bu Lan at her home. This cheers her up and for the first time they hang out together, watching a slide show of her father in Harvard and NASA as well as watching the sun go down on the rooftop.<br />\nGenerally motivated and filled with respect Bu Lan pushes the team and they win the next basketball game. A senior student Bao Wei Feng is an opponent in the next match, he begins to cause trouble and spreads rumours that the previous leader Zhao is in love with Bu Lan. Meanwhile the class monitor suggests the team use pretty girls to cheer and distract the opposing team in the next match. Upon hearing these rumours however Zhao leaves, upsetting Bu Lan and his friends. She continues without his mentor ship and prepares victory jerseys for the team. She later writes to her father about it and feels grown-up from the experience.<br />\nIn this important match the team play to the best of their abilities which are accentuated by the slow motion effect. Zhou, the previous leader walks past the game, feeling left out and alone he leaves for the ship bound for Dalian.<br />\nAt the docks, and just as the ship is sailing off his classmates, team and Bu Lan all come to say goodbye, they wave to him and he happily waves back.<br />\n(Kwenton Bellette, 2013).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Basketball - Training", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Teamwork (Sports)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651085, "name": "Peng Xiaolian", "creator_id": 82643, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q9139892", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651087, "name": "Pan Xueguo", "creator_id": 82645, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036779", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651084, "name": "Shanghai Film Studio", "creator_id": 32710, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7488444", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651086, "name": "Xue Youchun", "creator_id": 82644, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126613", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651092, "name": "Yong Jingxin", "creator_id": 82648, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357651", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651091, "name": "Zhou Jingzhou", "creator_id": 82647, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270935", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651089, "name": "Liu Lihua", "creator_id": 82646, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357783", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651088, "name": "Liu Yanxi", "creator_id": 82250, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651090, "name": "Shanghai Film Orchestra", "creator_id": 82388, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361210", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146446", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [55293]}, {"id": 115798, "acmi_id": "Z000058", "title": "The Visitor from California = Jia Zhou Lai Ke", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-visitor-from-california-jia-zhou-lai-ke", "creator_credit": "Liu Guanxiong, Xiao Pei and Nanhai Film Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1986", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Synopsis:<br />\nAnnie comes from California and is in China for her PhD research on Chinese women.

In the final scenes, Guo Moruo raises both hands into the heavens, showing his deep gratitude towards his Chinese comrades.<br />\n(Pearl Lau, 2013).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Sino-Japanese Conflict, 1937-1945", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 1}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651065, "name": "Ma Erlu", "creator_id": 82625, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143917", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651064, "name": "Yabiao Wang", "creator_id": 82297, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120307685", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651070, "name": "Wang Cheng", "creator_id": 82630, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036766", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651063, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q10873948", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651069, "name": "Qin Wei", "creator_id": 82629, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production designer", "role_id": 966, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651066, "name": "Yue Yu", "creator_id": 82626, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144070", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651073, "name": "Chen Tianlu", "creator_id": 82633, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091353", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651072, "name": "Dong Wenying", "creator_id": 82632, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126714", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651075, "name": "Su Lin", "creator_id": 82635, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315243", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651076, "name": "Xu Daolin", "creator_id": 82636, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040104", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651071, "name": "Yan Xiang", "creator_id": 82631, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357476", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651074, "name": "Zhao Jing", "creator_id": 82634, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036058", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651067, "name": "Jia Kuan", "creator_id": 82627, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121057883", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651068, "name": "Philharmonic Orchestra of China", "creator_id": 82628, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361410", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146443", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [55291]}, {"id": 115796, "acmi_id": "Z000055", "title": "Why was I born = Wei shen me sheng wo", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "why-was-i-born-wei-shen-me-sheng-wo", "creator_credit": "Li Yalin, Yan Wenpan and Emei Film Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1984", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Songsong, a young boy, lives with his divorced father.

When she arrives, she is greeted by her new colleague Jianxin. Treating her with great admiration, he takes her by tractor to the farm, which is still being built. He explains her job to her – to tend to the dairy cows.</p>\n<p>Settling in to her new position, Yunyun explains to Jianxin that she went to veterinary school after her father was accused of being a capitalist sympathiser. During this time, she was also sent to live on a commune. Jianxin explains to her that the leader of the village, Mr. Wang, proposed the construction of a dairy farm so that the locals can receive better diets.</p>\n<p>Present – Yunyun&#8217;s parents are concerned for their daughter&#8217;s welfare. After returning from the dairy farm at their request, she has since appeared melancholy. When they ask about her new position at the library, she complains she is unfit for the job, and that she still yearns to be a vet. When her mother suggests that she find work on a dairy farm closer to home, Yunyun explains that the solution is not that simple.</p>\n<p>Ruping, a friend of Yunyun&#8217;s, takes her to the Shanghai Zoo. Although he hopes to impress Yunyun and her love of animals, she spends the entire time complaining about how unhappy and uncared for the animals appear to be. Yunyun expresses an interest in getting a job at the zoo so she can impart her knowledge on the workers. Seeing a group of friends enjoying themselves, Yunyun flashes back to her time on the dairy farm, and the night they spent feasting on fish by the riverside.</p>\n<p>Back in the present, Yunyun runs into a friend from the dairy farm, and they are delighted to see each other. Yunyun asks about Jianxin, and learns he has been made director of the farm. Yunyun appears to miss Jianxin, confessing to her friend her feelings for him. Her friend implies Jianxin feels the same way too.</p>\n<p>Flashback – When Yunyun suggests they move the cows, the men at the farm tease her, saying the work is too hard for a woman. Jianxin praises her initiative, and the modernisation of China. As Yunyun and Jianxin attempt to move the cows, they discover one of the dairy cows has gone into labour. The next day, after having sat beside her all night, they help the cow deliver, naming the calf Little Star.</p>\n<p>Back in the present, Ruping asks Yunyun when they will become engaged. She insists they remain friends. Yunyun meets with her friend from the farm, and they reminisce on her time there. Yunyun asking about Little Star, and is delighted to find out she has now given birth herself.</p>\n<p>When Yunyun&#8217;s friend asks her why she left the farm, Yunyun has another flashback. The dairy farm is abandoned by the committee. Jianxin has faith that they will one day operate again. Yunyun sadly and reluctantly leaves, returning home to her family, who has sent for her. Jianxin is upset with Yunyun for leaving the farm at such a crucial time. When she asks Jianxin if he will see her off, he cruelly says, &#8220;I won&#8217;t see a deserter off&#8221;.

In the 12th century, nomadic tribes on the Mongol Steppe were at war, and the Kiyans defeated the Tatars. The Kiyan chief named his new-born son, Temujin, who later became the emperor of one of the most powerful empires of all time—Genghis Khan. When Temujin was 13, his father was poisoned to death by his enemy, the Tatars. The Kiyan tribe collapsed and Temujin narrowly escaped from being killed. Temujin became a hero of the Kiyans and was ambitious to restore the glory of the tribe. Temujin made alliance with the Kereyid tribe and won support from the powerful Jadaran tribe.

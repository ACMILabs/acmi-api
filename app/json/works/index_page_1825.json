It is the story of the life of Moses from birth and abandonment through manhood, slavery and the trials of turning his back on a privileged life in the Pharoah&#8217;s household and leading his people, the Jews out of Egypt and to freedom. Filmed in Egypt and the Sinai with one of the biggest sets ever constructed for a motion picture, this is a unique and motion picture experience with the parting of the Red Sea and the writing of the tablets being unforgettable highlights.

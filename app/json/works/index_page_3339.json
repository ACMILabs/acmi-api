Their friendship however was eventually pushed to the limits upon the arrival of a young girl on the scene. The two men, after having not seen each other for twenty years, are finally reunited - Michael has become a priest and Jimmy a university lecturer and both are seemingly overjoyed at the initial encounter. Unfortunately it is not long before the old rivalries return, only this time it is centred around a young mother and her son. The conflicts of times past emerge and personal differences begin to take over the newly revived friendship. Set in the early 1980s, the film relies on flashbacks (in b&amp;w) and some great 1960s music soundtrack to tell the story. Cast also includes Karen Archer, Alec McCowen, Liam Holt. Executive Producer: David Puttnam.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 875712, "name": "Enigma", "creator_id": 31561, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875713, "name": "Goldcrest Films", "creator_id": 21784, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875714, "name": "Chris Griffin", "creator_id": 31562, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875715, "name": "David Drury", "creator_id": 30075, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46724", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [29092], "external_references": []}, {"id": 76477, "acmi_id": "014467", "title": "Forever young", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "forever-young", "creator_credit": "Learning Corporation of America and Robin Lehman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Examines the fear of aging and what post-retirement years are really like by interviewing a group of active, interested people, all over the age of 65.

The play of light in the film, as in the original sculpture, enabled Moholy-Nagy to create an altogether new experience for the viewer, asserting his own proposition that,<br />\n&#8220;Because light is a spatial-temporal problem, the mere accentuation of the question of light brings us into the field of a new spatial awareness that cannot yet be fully analysed. We can, however, find a word to describe it: floating.&#8221;<br />\nMoholy-Nagy also saw his Light Space Modulator as an extension of the ideas underpinning cinema - magnified light projected on a surface in dynamic configurations. As such, Lightplay Black White Grey, his cinematic mediation of these spatial and light concerns is a vital work in his artistic practise. The film begins as a series of abstract images of geometric shapes and shadows formed by the kinetic movement of the Light Space Modulator. The circular movements of the sculpture and camera in combination provide a pendulous, hypnotic effect that is both a document of the sculpture and an elegant visual dance of shape-shifting forms and transformed light. The rhythmic combinations of stasis and dynamism across altered variations of screen space and superimpositions of motion and form makes for a vertiginous visual experience.<br />\nAlthough it cannot replicate the immersive experience of the light sculpture, the film creates a viewing space in which the audience is visually disoriented by Moholy-Nagy&#8217;s spatial dislocations. As the artist anticipated, this creates a sensation of detachment, of &#8216;floating&#8217;, amid a dynamic vision of light&#8217;s relationship to spatial understanding.</p>"],

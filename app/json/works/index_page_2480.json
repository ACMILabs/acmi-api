The film reflects the hardships, demeaning experiences and environments of peasantry farmers, as well as general society views at the time.

After graduating from High school, the young male protagonist Gao Jialin had the hopes of working as a teacher in a primary school in the city.  However, his dream was shattered when the opportunity was directly given to the son of a cadre.  Gao was forced to return to the countryside to earn a living with his parents as lowly peasant farmers and this abrupt fall down the social ladder plagued him every day.  He was constantly in denial about his peasantry life until an illiterate, country girl Liu Qiaozhen attempts to open his eyes to see the beauty of the country folks and their country life.

Liu was left heartbroken and was soon married off to a man who had a crush on her from another village.</p>\n<p>Gao learns about Liu&#8217;s fate but was convinced by Huang, who despite already having a boyfriend, that he can have a brighter future in her company because she is educated and is brought up in a family of higher social class.

It continues through to the multiculturalism of the 1970s and the eventual phasing out of that most incongruous White Australia Policy, particularly in the light of Australia&#8217;s involvement with Vietnam and our acceptance of the Vietnamese boat people to our shores. Includes footage of child migration; Dunera boys and internees; displaced persons; Bonegilla - Australia&#8217;s first holding centre for arriving non-British migrants; 10 pound Poms and &#8220;Bring out a Briton&#8221; campaign; the Snowy Mountains Scheme; multicultural events as well as many great shots from the past of some of Australia&#8217;s historic moments (air raid on Darwin in 1943, the arrival of the Dunera), prominent citizens (Jack Lang, Arthur Calwell, Chips Rafferty) and well-known landscapes (Port Melbourne docks, Sydney Harbour).

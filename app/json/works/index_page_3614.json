From the diamond mines of South Africa, numerous caches of goods are going missing, making authorities fear that the market is in danger of being flooded. Bond is assigned to unravel the identity of the mystery stockpiler by going undercover as Peter Franks, a crook who is a part of a smuggling ring. A typically labyrinthine plot sends Bond to Amsterdam and then Las Vegas, chasing the recipient of a large diamond delivery whilst enjoying the charms of fellow smuggler Tiffany Case (Jill St John). Bond&#8217;s nemesis, Ernst Stavros Blofeld, returns planning to use the diamonds in a satellite that will allow him to hold the world for ransom. Bond survives his own cremation as well as encounters with memorable killers Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, a diabolical pair of lovers with a deadpan sense of humour, and two lethal martial arts gymnasts, Bambi and Thumper, who give Bond a going over.

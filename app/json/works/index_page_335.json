A loose translation of Caspar David Friedrich&#8217;s &#8216;Wanderer above the Sea of Fog&#8217; (1818), the image stages the sublime position of the loan character in Friedrich&#8217;s painting in its representation of the BMX bicycle rider&#8217;s spatial orientation in and interaction with the contemporary urban landscape. Sequence two presents an aerial view of skateboarders falling into a tiled wall, some alone and others grouped together, with subtle reflections in composition on the geometry of Abstract art and the distant framing of imagery and figures in Western religious artworks. A layered soundscape of the sounds derived from the focal environment accompanies the projections to produce a low volume ambience for the on screen movements.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Performance"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Multi channel moving image"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1135802, "name": "Mark Larenzetto", "creator_id": 9277, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1135797, "name": "Shaun Gladwell", "creator_id": 9260, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1135801, "name": "Tobias Grime", "creator_id": 81912, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1135800, "name": "Gotaro Uematsu", "creator_id": 73575, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1135799, "name": "Nigel Begg", "creator_id": 81911, "role": "stunt professional", "role_id": 614, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1135798, "name": "Wade Marynowsky", "creator_id": 81910, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVCAM;

Benning collects images of this socially-pervasive violence from (like mumbledy-peg) personal experiences, and those of others. Throughout, she uses small toys as props and examples, handling and controlling them the way we are in turn controlled by larger, violent forces. In &#8216;It Wasn&#8217;t Love&#8217;, Benning illustrates a lustful encounter with a <code>bad girl,&amp;#8217; through the gender posturing and genre interplay of Hollywood stereotypes: posing for the camera as the rebel, the platinum blonde, the gangster, the &amp;#8216;50s crooner, and the heavy-lidded vamp. Cigarette poses, romantic slow dancing, and fast-action heavy-metal street shots propel the viewer through the story of the love affair. Benning&amp;#8217;s video goes farther than romantic fantasy, describing other facets of physical attraction including fear, violence, lust, guilt, and total excitement. As she puts it, &amp;#8216;It wasn&amp;#8217;t love, but it was something&amp;#8217;.

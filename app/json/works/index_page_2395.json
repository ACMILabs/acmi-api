With four actors portraying the Dalai Lama at different ages, the film begins in 1933 with the death of the 13th Dalai Lama. Born in a remote area, the new Dalai Lama (seen at ages two and five in early sequences) is observed by monks who determine that he is the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion. In 1944 he uses newsreels and Western magazines to study WWII events, and as the war ends, he is forced to deal with Chinese Communist aggression. Mao&#8217;s military stranglehold on Tibet eventually forces the Dalai Lama to flee to Dharmsala, India.

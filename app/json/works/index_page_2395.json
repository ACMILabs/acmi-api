Richard Burton is psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart who is investigating the reasons for the young man&#8217;s apparent senseless crime. Based on Peter Shaffer&#8217;s acclaimed play, &#8220;Equus&#8221; is a film that explores and manages to traverse a rich field of themes and concerns: psychoanalysis and mythology; sexuality and repression; class and family; sex and power. The relationship between analyst and patient becomes increasingly complex as the mysteries of the boy&#8217;s repressions become unravelled. The men&#8217;s exchanges begin to be complicated by the echoes of homoeroticism and the psychological overtones of the Oedipal Complex. Though dominated by the performances of Burton and Firth, &#8220;Equus&#8221; features an excellent supporting cast including Joan Plowright, Eileen Atkins and Jenny Agutter.

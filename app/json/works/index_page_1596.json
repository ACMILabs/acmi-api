From that bizarre coincidence Makhmalbaf developed a script in which both the policeman and the activist have a chance to tell each side of their story on film. However, &#8220;A Moment of Innocence&#8221; is much more than a study in political perspective. As the two older men recruit young actors to play themselves on film, they must deal with both cinema&#8217;s ability to romanticise and falsify history, as well as having to explain to a younger generation the complicated history of Iran prior to the 1979 revolution. As the young actors struggle to understand the hatreds of the past, they also force the older men to understand their own mistakes and their own prejudices. This remarkable film, beautifully shot in the middle of a Teheran winter, is a celebration of the humanist impulse in history and also a remarkably optimistic celebration of young people which puts much of Hollywood&#8217;s cynical exploitation of youth to shame. In Farsi with English subtitles. Also distributed under the title &#8220;A Matter of Innocence&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Persian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Postmodernism", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Postmodernism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Humanism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Iran", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Humanism", "History&nbsp;→ Iran - History", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993621, "name": "Mohsen Makhmalbaf", "creator_id": 29095, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55211", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993620, "name": "Pakhsh Iran", "creator_id": 31256, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993619, "name": "Pakhsh Iran", "creator_id": 31256, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46373", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 189, "name": "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "slug": "iran-islamic-republic-of"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [28821], "external_references": []}, {"id": 89311, "acmi_id": "312014", "title": "Living in oblivion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "living-in-oblivion", "creator_credit": "Tom Di Cillo, Marcus Viscidi, Michael Griffiths, Lemon sky productions and JDI productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Tom Di Cillo&#8217;s acute comedy on the horrors of low-budget film making originally started life as a short film before it was extended to feature length.

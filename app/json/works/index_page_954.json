The internal investigation into the shooting of Steve Hennessey continues. Meantime, Roz Breen (Jeanette Cronin) who has been charged with smuggling drugs into prison, decides to fight the case. Her defence is &#8220;duress&#8221;, caused by intimidation and fear of the Hennessey family. Although Steve is dead, the drug trafficking connection still lives on. &#8220;My learned friend, Mr Hennessey&#8221; (52 mins) (directed by Michael Carson) shows Mal Hennessey (Brett Swain) in a somewhat different light to the usual cold, indifferent violent person that he can be, as he defends himself in a commital hearing on a charge of &#8220;Breach of prison&#8221; relating to his escape from the Police Van. With Shirl Hennessey still in Fairlea and no money to pay Michael Kidd to defend him, Mal has to take on the system. And take on the system he does, much to Vic Manoulis&#8217;s frustration and Peter Faithful&#8217;s growing concern. Contains some scenes in b&amp;w.

The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures the visit of Australian champion golfer Peter Thomson to the Wangaratta Golf Club in 1956. As shown by the poster in the film, Thomson teaches a golf clinic to an avid crowd. At the time, Thomson had won the British Open twice, and would go on to win it a total of five times - he was the first Australian golfer to win the championship and the only man to have won it in three consecutive years in the twentieth century (1954, 1955 and 1956).</p>\n<p>The film shows off the lovely surrounds of the Golf Club set against the backdrop of the town itself and in particular, the backyards of houses.

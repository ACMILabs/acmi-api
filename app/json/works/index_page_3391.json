Years later, iron clad warships provide the basis of America&#8217;s naval power. The United German Republic also features during this period with Japan joining them as a naval super power. &#8220;1906-1916: Clash of the Dreadnoughts&#8221;: In 1906 Britain upset the global balance of power by constructing the big gun battleship HMS Dreadnought - instigating an arms race that led to the largest confrontation in naval history. The greatest threat to Britain&#8217;s power came from Germany who had the second largest battle fleet in the world. Germany were quick to match Britain in the construction of new battleships, allies Austria and Italy were not far behind. Episode 2 covers the machinations of World War 1, U-boats, the British raid on Heligoland Bight and the Battle of Jutland. &#8220;1916-1939: The Darkness of the future&#8221;: The might of the battleship is questioned after in excess of 8000 British and German soldiers lose their lives in World War 1. Fingers are pointed in Britain, but Germany views the event as a tactical victory. The Washington Treaty attempts to put an end to the naval arms race, not everyone is agreeable however and Japan builds two of the biggest battleships ever seen, Yamato and Musachi, causing unease amongst the rest of the world. &#8220;1939-now: Terror from above&#8221;: The final episode in this epic series describes in detail the final years of World War II, including victories of the German U-boats and the trickle down effect on world trade. Coverage is provided of the Battle of Taranto and battleships Bismarck and Hood. Throughout the remainder of the war battleships were being replaced from the sky in the form of airplanes and the Aircraft Carrier, culminating in the attack on Pearl Harbour. The use of battleships post World War II continued to decline.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military history", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military offences", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Naval operations - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Europe", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Naval operations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Pacific Area", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ International cooperation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ International relations", "History&nbsp;→ Military history", "History&nbsp;→ War - History", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - History", "History&nbsp;→ World history", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924622, "name": "Peter Butt", "creator_id": 19877, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7173104", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924621, "name": "Rob McAuley", "creator_id": 19322, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035082", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1807991, "name": "Rob McAuley", "creator_id": 19322, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035082", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924619, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924617, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126876", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924618, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 924616, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51793", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33443]}, {"id": 79090, "acmi_id": "323947", "title": "The Battle of Billy's pond (Captioned)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-battle-of-billys-pond-captioned", "creator_credit": "Children's Film Foundation (London, England)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1976", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>When enthusiastic young fisherman, Billy, and his friend, Cobby, find their favourite pond polluted with dead fish floating on the surface, they decide to investigate.

Her relationships with journalist Dirk Bogarde, company director Laurence Harvey, an effeminate photographer and an Italian Prince are never really satisfying. &#8220;Darling&#8221; was groundbreaking in its time because it exposed the &#8220;swinging 60&#8217;s&#8221; with its more &#8220;modern&#8221; attitudes towards sexuality, homosexuality and infidelity in a frank and adult manner. The viewer may be left feeling that Christie&#8217;s character is shallow and cold despite her vulnerabilty, and that the emptiness of her life is of her own making.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952689, "name": "Embassy Pictures Corporation (US)", "creator_id": 24407, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952690, "name": "Joseph Janni", "creator_id": 22931, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952691, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952688, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40541", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [24076]}]}

They manage to find their way out, not realising that Baltar - hiding on his base-star in the magnetic void - has allowed them to escape so he can track them back to the battlestar Galactica. Meanwhile, Boomer and Jolly discover a Cylon outpost stationed on the surface of an asteroid, and rush back to warn the Galactica, unaware that the Cylons had seen them.

In order to synthesise a cure, Dr. Salik must return to the asteroid to find the cause, so Adama orders the recruitment of female shuttle pilots for Viper training so they can protect him from attack. Catching the outpost by surprise, the newly recruited Viper pilots defeat the Cylon fleet.

Meanwhile, back on the Galactica, with the threat of attack hanging over the ship, Apollo and Serina marry. The Galactica is guided to a remote planet by a star as foretold in the Book of the Word, and upon landing, Adama, Apollo and Serina realise that they have found Kobol.

As the Cylons attack the planet, Adama discovers clues as to the path of the &#8220;thirteenth tribe&#8221;, and Baltar is punished for his treachery.

In Part Two of &#8216;Lost planet of the Gods&#8217;, Adama directs the Galactica to fly into the void earlier discovered by Apollo and Starbuck in search of the mythical planet Kobol. While out intercepting another Cylon strike force, Starbuck is captured, and taken to Baltar, who claims the Cylons want peace. Meanwhile, back on the Galactica, with the threat of attack hanging over the ship, Apollo and Serina marry. The Galactica is guided to a remote planet by a star as foretold in the Book of the Word, and upon landing, Adama, Apollo and Serina realise that they have found Kobol. However, Baltar is waiting for them, anxious to make amends and negotiate peace. As the Cylons attack the planet, Adama discovers clues as to the path of the &#8220;thirteenth tribe&#8221;, and Baltar is punished for his treachery.

For the other three weeks, students wrote the script and edited the film under normal classroom conditions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Student films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 749486, "name": "Bairnsdale Technical School", "creator_id": 17026, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 749487, "name": "Kevin Murray", "creator_id": 75142, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "26714", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [10534]}, {"id": 88239, "acmi_id": "310791", "title": "Odd jobs", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "odd-jobs", "creator_credit": "AFTRS and Daniel Nettheim", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1993", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This hilarious adventure centres around two boy scouts, who, while on &#8220;bob-a-job&#8221; stumble on a spooky old house.

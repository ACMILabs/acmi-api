It includes previously unseen Movietone reports and official NASA Aeronautics and Space Reports capturing some of the most dramatic and momentous occasions in space history. The video opens with newsreel footage (1959-1961) of animals in space, the first step towards man&#8217;s flight into space, then follows chronologically from the Project Mercury missions (1961-1963), the Project Gemini missions (1965-1966) and eventually the Project Apollo missions (1966-1975), including footage from two of the most famous missions, Apollo 11 when Armstrong and Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon (20 July 1969), and the Apollo-Soyuz mission (15 July 1975) where the American astronauts and the Russian cosmonauts transfer to each other&#8217;s space ships in a rendezvous in space whilst orbiting around earth. Also includes footage on Space Lab and the development of the Space Shuttle (1975-1979).

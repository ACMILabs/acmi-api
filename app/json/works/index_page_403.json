Paul and his mother (Francesca Annis) seek refuge in the deserts of the planet Arakis. They join the Fremen who live under the desert sands. Soon the prophecy of a messiah becomes true as Paul leads the Fremen in battle against the forces controlling and manipulating their planet and the precious spice Melange. David Lynch manages to create a sense of the complex dynastical world which Frank Herbert had created in his popular novel, whilst retaining Lynch&#8217;s love for the bizarre and disturbing.

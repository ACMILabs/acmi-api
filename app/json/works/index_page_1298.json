But before his contribution was recognised, the French inventor mysteriously disappeared and has been largely forgotten. Thomas Edison wasn’t forgotten though. After revealing his Kinetoscope in 1893, crowds lined up to watch short films through a peephole.

In 1895, moving images broke free with the Lumiere Brothers’ Cinematographe, a device that could record, develop and project film onto a screen for public viewing.

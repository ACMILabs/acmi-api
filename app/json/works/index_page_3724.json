Each of the sisters deceives the others about their activities, but eventually they all suspect each other. And when fox hair begins to grow on their bodies, the truth is out. They go to confront the scholar, only to find that he is the god of Carnal Desire, Wu Tung. Basically a soft-porn comedy that also features lush cinematography and costumes, and impressive fight sequences. Cast includes Amy Yip, Man Siu, Pal Sin and Kamimura Kyoko.

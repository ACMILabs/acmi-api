This slasher/psychothriller cliche-filled film has its moments of humor, creepiness and horror but it lacks in script and direction and some unimpressive acting by the support cast. Special mention must be made, however, of a brief appearance by a very young Mickey Rourke. Cast also includes Tim Thomerson, Gwynne Gilford, Normann Burton, Morgan Paull, James Luisi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoses", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964233, "name": "Leisure Investment", "creator_id": 36545, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964234, "name": "Movie Ventures", "creator_id": 36546, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964235, "name": "George G.

Filmed over the years 1949-1963 and edited in 1976, the film documents the New York counterculture of the &#8216;50s and the development of Mekas&#8217; own filming style. In Mekas&#8217; own words &#8220;the period I am dealing with in these six reels was a period of desperation, of attempts to desperately grow roots into the new ground, create new memories&#8221;. &#8220;Lost lost lost&#8221; then is a beautifully elegiac poem, a paean to the nature of memory and meaning of experiences wrought in a new land whilst participating in an exciting new sub-culture, burgeoning with possibility for change. Divided into six reels Mekas narrates and places intertitles between sections of film that give context to his images. His empathy for post-war immigrants is transparent; his fascination for the street life of Brooklyn, and in particular the poor suburb of Williamsburg where he lived; Mekas also conveys his melancholy for all that has passed. Reel one deals with Mekas&#8217; displacement and discovery of the city, his enduring loneliness and links with the Lithuanian community; Reel two depicts various social events including a wedding and New Year&#8217;s Eve celebration; Reel 3 displays the hold that cinema increasingly has on the Mekas&#8217; brothers; Reel 4 reveals the brothers&#8217; fascination for activism, depicting marches and protests; in Reel 5 Mekas reveals a newfound peace as he reconnects with rural life; Reel 6 marks Mekas&#8217; continuing journey as a filmmaker as he begins to fraternise with poets and artists from the Beat Generation.

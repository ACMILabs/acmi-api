The film follows parallel narratives which eventually converge, opening on a initially erotically charged heterosexual coupling which ends with the brutal murder of the male. The woman (played with mute ferocity by Beatrice Dalle), naked and covered in blood and gore is later discovered by her resigned husband (Alex Descas) who disposes of the mangled body, takes his wife home and ties her to their bed. Meanwhile an American doctor (Vincent Gallo) and his newlywed wife arrive in France for their honeymoon. Unbeknown to the young bride her husband has come to Paris with a darker agenda in mind. What begins to emerge is that the doctor and the murderess from the start of the film share a rare pathology that becomes shockingly apparent as the film plays out. Denis deliberately keeps the story opaque, instead relying heavily on mood created through the mournful and lush soundtrack by the Tindersticks and the evocative imagery, lensed by Denis&#8217;s regular cinematographer Agnes Godard. What emerges is a mysterious and compelling experience that doesn&#8217;t shy away from the more corporeal aspects of the story.

But a rival group of rescuers, the Marcus siblings, resent Dunpeal&#8217;s presence, and plan to use him in order to collect the loot. In his quest, D faces many nasty encounters with murderous semi-human creatures, including a werewolf, a shape-shifter, a phantom queen, and a subculture of human-hating monsters. In Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&#8221;, the sequel to &#8220;Vampire hunter D (1985), the future has the aesthetic of a dystopic, medieval nightmare but the animation is far more sophisticated than in the original. Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Wicked City, Animatrix) keeps the action exciting, even if the characterisations are simplistic, and the violent gory animatronics are awe-inspiring in scope, embodying all the qualities of gothic, bloody combat, whilst harking to the model of the eternal outsider, moody and disliked, shunned by society and feared by his enemies.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Japan", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Japanese literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999147, "name": "Yoshiaki Kawajiri", "creator_id": 27550, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2593083", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999145, "name": "Masao Maruyama", "creator_id": 79264, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q327121", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999144, "name": "Mata Yamamoto", "creator_id": 80506, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270976", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999146, "name": "Taka Nagasawa", "creator_id": 80729, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143980", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999143, "name": "Film Line International", "creator_id": 36225, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999142, "name": "Urban Vision Entertainment", "creator_id": 36224, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999141, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52196", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33811]}, {"id": 94267, "acmi_id": "318069", "title": "House on Haunted Hill", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "house-on-haunted-hill-dvd", "creator_credit": "William Castle and Allied Artists Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1958", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 53039, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q263583"}], "brief_description": "<p>Directed in 1958 by 50s B-grade horror maestro William Castle, &#8220;House on Haunted Hill&#8221; boasted the arrival of &#8220;Emergo&#8221;, a fluorescent skeleton that swept across the head of audience members in the cinema.

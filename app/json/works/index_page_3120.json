Further diagnosed with borderline personality disorder - symptoms of which are mental instability, pessimism, and social contrariness - Susanna is locked away from the outer world and thrust into the company of a group of disturbed young women including Georgina (Clea DuVall), a pathological liar, Daisy (Brittany Murphy), a woman suffering a bizarre eating disorder, and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a charismatically cruel sociopath. Intrigued by Lisa, Susanna rebels against the authority represented by Nurse Valerie and Dr. Wick, and befriends her fellow inmates, allowing herself to become caught up in their collective madness. Forming a love-hate relationship with Lisa becomes the catalyst for events that ultimately help Susanna to resolve many inner conflicts, and fight her way back to sanity.

Spike Lee&#8217;s &#8220;Girl 6&#8221; stands as one of his most under-rated films. A clear-sighted examination of fantasy, this film features an excellent cast of women who approach their life, work and relationships with street-smart humour. It is the men around them who find themselves ultimately more repressed by the guilt and shame with which they shroud their sexual fantasies. The film also intelligently and sharply explores the contradictions of race and performance, examining how for an African-American woman the &#8220;invisibility&#8221; of voice and the phone allows for a greater opportunity of expression than when roles are circumscribed by the hue of her skin colour. This is a vibrant, entertaining and poignant film.

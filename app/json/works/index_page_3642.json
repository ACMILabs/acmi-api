As Houdini ages, he becomes obsessed with the existence of the after life, vowing to escape death as he escapes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Houdini, Harry, 1874-1926"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 878227, "name": "Pen Densham", "creator_id": 18444, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7162089", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1807730, "name": "Leanne Moore", "creator_id": 32736, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878225, "name": "Trilogy Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 30226, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270942", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878224, "name": "Turner Network Television", "creator_id": 24880, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q688333", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 878223, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48491", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [30646]}, {"id": 68569, "acmi_id": "321421", "title": "Hotspot", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hotspot", "creator_credit": "Robin Lehman and Phoenix Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1974", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Shows the Nyiragongo Volcano in the Republic of Zaire, Africa.

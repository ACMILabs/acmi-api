John, Mick, Paul, Jim and Kerry are workers employed by Brit Rail; when BR is privatised the men find themselves being lured by offers of voluntary redundancy (for large cash sums). Then, working for a private company, and sub-contractors, they are virtually without rights in the workplace, increasingly subject to unstable employment conditions, and despite the overtures of management, are subjected to progressively unsafe workplace practices. Loach explores their private lives, which range from happily married to disgruntled fathers separated from their children, as a way of highlighting the additional burden on families of economic rationalism.

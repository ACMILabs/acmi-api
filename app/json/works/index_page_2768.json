As massive as these forces are, the stories of human heroism and tragedy are very personal, meet heroes, fighting to save their homes and lives, and meet the scientists as they study the elemental killers, in an effort to predict, prepare and protect ourselves from nature&#8217;s fury.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Atmosphere", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Earthquakes", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Floods", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Hurricanes", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural disasters", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Storms", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Tornadoes", "Documentary", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Atmosphere", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 240090, "name": "National Geographic Society", "creator_id": 14705, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 240091, "name": "Jaime Bernanke", "creator_id": 30899, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45917", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [28432], "external_references": []}, {"id": 70782, "acmi_id": "007484", "title": "Nature's forge", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "natures-forge", "creator_credit": "Atomic Energy Commission", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1974", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Examines the ecological effects of the release of excess heat from power plants.

The irony is, I was really split between my tremendous admiration for Bresson (&#8216;A man escaped&#8217;) and the temptation to make a Hitchcock-like film. In a lot of scenes, especially inside the elevator, I was trying to emulate Bresson. On top of that, I was trying to portray a new generation through the characters of the children (in those days they were called &#8216;blousons noirs&#8217;  because they all wore black leather, those kids from the suburbs) - a description of the new Paris. Traditionally it was always the Rene Clair Paris that French films presented, and I took care to show one of the first modern buildings in Paris. I showed a Paris, not of the future, but at least a modern city, a world already somewhat dehumanized.&#8221; Source: Philip French and Louis Malle, &#8220;Malle on</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Jean Thuillier ; director, Louis Malle ; writers, Roger Nimier, Louis Malle ; photography, Henri Decae ; music, Miles Davis ; assistant directors, Alain Cavalier, Francois Leterrier ; editor, Leonid Azar.<br />\nCast: Jeanne Moreau, Maurice Ronet, Georges Poujouly, Felix Marten, Yori Bertin, Charles Denner, Hubert Deschamps, Jacques Hilling, Jean-Claude Brialy, Lino Ventura, Jean Wall, Jacqueline Staup, Marcel Cuvelier.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890480, "name": "Jean Thuillier", "creator_id": 31748, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890481, "name": "Louis Malle", "creator_id": 18070, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146679", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1958", "notes": "", "to_year": "1958"}], "labels": [55452]}, {"id": 84780, "acmi_id": "306115", "title": "Ascendancy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ascendancy", "creator_credit": "BFI, Penny Clark, Ian Elsey and Edward Bennett", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1982", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Ireland 1920.

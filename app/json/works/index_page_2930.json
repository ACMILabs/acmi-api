Shot largely in long handheld takes, the film posits sex as a force that shatters not only class allegiances and established social patterns but even the order represented by conventional narrative structures. Eliciting spontaneous and improvised performances from his actors, Pialat blends a loosely told love story with an acute social observation of the sexual and social mores of France in the seventies. The characters&#8217; actions and behaviours are presented straightforwardly without moralising, enabling an open-ended exploration of the way class differences play out in power relations between the sexes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915840, "name": "Action Films", "creator_id": 28188, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915841, "name": "Gaumont-British Instructional", "creator_id": 12382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915842, "name": "Klaus Hellwig", "creator_id": 77444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915843, "name": "Yves Gasser", "creator_id": 79374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915844, "name": "Maurice Pialat", "creator_id": 36435, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52382", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [33958], "external_references": []}]}

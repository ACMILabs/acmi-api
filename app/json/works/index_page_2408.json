The irrigation set piece which provides the film&#8217;s climax is justly famous. In 1935, the film was distributed under the title &#8216;The Miracle of life&#8217; according to AMPAS records. The film opens with an interview with King Vidor recorded by David Shepard in the 1980s. &#8216;Our Daily Bread&#8217; is followed by 2 short films, anonymously produced by Irving Thalberg at MGM in support of the re-election of the conservative party at the Californian gubernatorial elections. Cast includes Karen Morley, Tom Keene, Barbara Pepper, Addison Richards and John Qualen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Farm life", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Farm life - United States", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Rural women", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community development", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929 - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Economic depressions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural women", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Rural women", "History&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929 - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/our-daily-bread", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993567, "name": "King Vidor", "creator_id": 71126, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51133", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993566, "name": "Viking Productions", "creator_id": 31189, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46268", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1934", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1934"}], "labels": [28745]}, {"id": 89252, "acmi_id": "311944", "title": "Journey of hope = Reise der Hoffnung = Umud'a yolculuk", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "journey-of-hope-reise-der-hoffnung-umuda-yolculuk", "creator_credit": "Xavier Koller, Alfi Sinniger, Catpics and Condor Features", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Switzerland, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44353, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q675112"}], "brief_description": "<p>The true story of a Turkish couples&#8217;s flight, with their young son, from the abject poverty and hardship of their mountain village in Turkey to the land of unimagined riches - Switzerland.

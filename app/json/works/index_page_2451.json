The treaty also incurs the wrath of conservative military brass General Scott (Burt Lancaster in a part inspired by the far-right ramblings of one General Edwin Walker), who considers this move towards disarmament as an act of treason. When Colonel Casey (Kirk Douglas) discovers a cryptic message on Scott&#8217;s desk relating to a top secret military base in Texas whose existence is unknown even to the Presidents, he becomes convinced that Scott will use the forthcoming Full Alert exercise to overthrow the US government. Having won the President&#8217;s trust, Casey gathers a small circle of loyal friends around him to go and seek evidence against Scott before the Alert deadline.

A class teacher in a school situation then adopts the same approach using the theme &#8216;buses&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education, Primary", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Games in mathematics education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Study and teaching", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Juvenile films", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Study and teaching", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 747701, "name": "John Krish", "creator_id": 13969, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6243454", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1811172, "name": "John Arnold", "creator_id": 2032, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 747699, "name": "A Graphic Film", "creator_id": 16571, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25860", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1971", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1971"}], "labels": [9692]}, {"id": 98386, "acmi_id": "508046", "title": "Maths at home", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maths-at-home", "creator_credit": "Anna Jackson and BBC", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Illustrates a number of ways in which parents can maximise mathematically orientated activities with their children using everyday home activities.

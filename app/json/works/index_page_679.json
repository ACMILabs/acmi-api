This object is in working condition tested by Mark Baer 2 November 2019.</p>\n<p>Text from Arieh Offman, Curator, Videogames, ACMI - &#8220;The Brown Box prototype, created and patented by Ralph Baer, was the forerunner to the first home console ever released, the Magnavox Odyssey (currently held by ACMI), and development began in 1966. It was originally called the ‘TV Game Unit #7’ and received its better known name ‘Brown Box’ from the faux wood grain self-adhesive vinyl that was attached to the prototype to make it more attractive to potential investor. The game unit could play multiple programs / games, and this was achieved by flipping the physical switches on the front of the unit – these included games such as ping pong, checkers, and four different sports games. The Brown Box was the seventh version of this prototype, with multiple versions coming before and after it with alterations to hardware and output.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Description from the Smithsonian Museum:<br />\n&#8220;This machine paved the way for the video games of today.<br />\nIn 1967, Ralph Baer and his colleagues at Sanders Associates, Inc. developed a prototype for the first multiplayer, multiprogram video game system. Since Sanders hoped to license the technology for a commercial venture, Baer understood that the games had to be fun or investors and consumers would not be interested. In an oral history interview (copies available in the Archives Center at the National Museum of American History), Ralph Baer recalled, “The minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren’t too sure.”Originally called TV Game Unit #7, much like the &#8220;Pump Unit&#8221; before it, it became far better known by its nickname, “The Brown Box.” The name comes from the brown wood-grain, self-adhesive vinyl used to make the prototype look more attractive to potential investors. The &#8220;Brown Box,&#8221; though only a prototype, had basic features that most video games consoles still have today: two controls and a multigame program system.The &#8220;Brown Box&#8221; could be programmed to play a variety of games by flipping the switches along the front of the unit, as can be seen in the picture. Program cards were used to show which switches needed to be set for specific games. &#8220;Brown Box&#8221; games included ping-pong, checkers, four different sports games, target shooting with the use of a lightgun and a golf putting game, which required the use of a special attachment. Sanders licensed the &#8220;Brown Box&#8221; to Magnavox, which released the system as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972.&#8221; https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1301997</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Brown Box replica </p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ralph Baer</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 2019</p>", "description": "<p>In 1966, the father of videogames, Ralph Baer, began developing the Brown Box prototype, the forerunner to the first home console ever released, the Magnavox Odyssey. </p>\n<p>Originally called the ‘TV Game Unit #7’, Baer’s prototype became better known as the Brown Box because of its faux wood-grain vinyl.

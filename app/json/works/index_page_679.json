Soldier Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) finally gains permission from John Lowes, the priest of Branderston, to marry his niece, Sara (Hilary Dwyer), as long as he promises to take her away to another village. As Richard returns to his regiment, Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price) and his sadistic assistant, John Stearne, ride into town, seeking a priest who allegedly worships Satan.

Hua politely evades Ma’s advances and retreats behind a curtain to change. Ma peers through the curtain, telling her that he has paid and expects favours in return. When Hua’s husband Jin Lingtong tells Ma that they sell their art, but not their bodies, Ma redirects his derision, insisting that Jin must perform songs at his request. Jin does this until he collapses from exhaustion, blood trickling from his lips.

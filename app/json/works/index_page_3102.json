In the tradition of &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221;, the Jim Henson Company have made wonderful use of special effects, computer animation, puppet characters and cinemaphotography to create an atmospheric, magical and fantastical retelling of &#8220;Jack and the beanstalk&#8221;. Cast also includes Daryl Hannah, Jon Voight, Richard Attenborough, and Honor Blackman. Story by James V. Hart and Brian Henson. (Award: Best Single Television Presentation 2002, Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films)</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This modern day retelling of the classic fairytale &#8220;Jack and the beanstalk&#8221; was originally released as a two-part teleplay and is directed more at a teen/adult audience, rather than for young children. The main characters still feature in the story, young Jack (J.J. Feild), the giant &#8220;Thunderdell&#8221; (Bill Barretta), the goose that lays the golden eggs, the golden harp, the princess Ondine (Mia Sara). However, that&#8217;s just about where the similarities begin and end with the original children&#8217;s fairytale version. This is a far more sinister tale focusing on greed, murder and the corporate world of Jack Robinson (Matthew Modine) who has been taught by his ancestors to, &#8220;believe in the possibility of the impossible&#8221;. Jack&#8217;s dream is to build on the family site a &#8220;Magic Castle Resort and Casino&#8221; but problems of a mysterious kind begin to plague him when a giant human skeleton is found buried on the land and the figure of a woman known as the Matriarch (Vanessa Redgrave), appears from out of nowhere to divulge the secrets of Jack&#8217;s ancestors, exposing their sins and a family curse that he can only undo. From here the world of fantasy takes over and it is up to you to believe or not.

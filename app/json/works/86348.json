Reading provides her with some assurance that she&#8217;s not alone, but she longs to go to school and meet other children. Matilda&#8217;s loneliness disappears when she begins school; she makes friends and has a lovely teacher, Miss Honey. The only problem is Miss Honey&#8217;s horrible aunt, Trunchbowl, headmistress of the school. Matilda is drawn to the kind Miss Honey and together they set about changing their unhappy lives so that they&#8217;re both in a loving family. With Matilda&#8217;s magic power that allow her to move objects, anything is possible. Look out nasty parents and evil Trunchbowl!

In a series of set pieces, in turn cynical and ironic, sentimental and nostalgic, Charlie unsuccessfully assumes a variety of occupations from assembly line worker to singing waiter. In between he becomes one of the unemployed, a willing prisoner and the companion of a working class girl. The film begins as social satire but Chaplin&#8217;s factory is too stylised to give the humor much bite. The film is ultimately more about homelessness than modernity. Chaplin&#8217;s political and philosophical naivete is disarming. His comic genius as a performer is timeless.

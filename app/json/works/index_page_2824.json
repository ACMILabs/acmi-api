Meanwhile, the circus needs a trainer and Xiaolong proposes this to his parents. Of course, they won&#8217;t have a bar of it, and after a heated argument with Xiaolong, the grandma and mother conspire to dump the dog in a ditch, far far away — but, of course, after a series of adventures the dog manages to find his way back.</p>\n<p>While Xiaolong is out looking for his dog he finds himself — literally — in a dog and pony show, where he performs a bunch of impromptu tricks and is met with wild applause by the audience. After receiving the highest praise from the circus trainers Xiaolong literally runs off to join the circus.

On the surface the film appears to simply discuss the ability of humans and animals to communicate with kindness and respect. But it seems also to have some much deeper connotations: The education of &#8220;dumb&#8221; individuals is shown time and time again in the film to always lead to the inevitable conclusion of an abusive master-pupil relationship — often one where the so-called &#8220;pupil&#8221; is more intelligent than the frustrated &#8220;teacher&#8221;. However, this film seems to take a far more liberal and positive approach, arguing that communication is always possible, whether it be between humans and/or animals.<br />\nThe highlights of the film are the tricks performed by these animals, which are often quite amazing.<br />\nThough this is a Beijing production, it is actually the Shanghai circus that performs<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal communication", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal trainers", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal welfare", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animals, Treatment of", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Children and animals", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Circus animals", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Childrens Films", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology) in children", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus animals", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus performers", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889736, "name": "Beijing Children's Film Company", "creator_id": 82370, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889737, "name": "Chen Jinshu", "creator_id": 82371, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889738, "name": "Wang Feng", "creator_id": 82372, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889739, "name": "Chen Tongyi", "creator_id": 82373, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889740, "name": "Wang Jiuwen", "creator_id": 82374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889741, "name": "Zhang Wuqi", "creator_id": 82375, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889742, "name": "Ma Yi", "creator_id": 82376, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889743, "name": "Gong Xunchen", "creator_id": 82377, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889744, "name": "Da Lishi", "creator_id": 82378, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889745, "name": "Shi Yuan", "creator_id": 82379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889746, "name": "Liang Qingang", "creator_id": 82380, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [55255], "external_references": []}, {"id": 96092, "acmi_id": "502968", "title": "Miss Goodall and the wild chimpanzees", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "miss-goodall-and-the-wild-chimpanzees", "creator_credit": "National Geographic Society", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Describes Jane Goodall and her studies as she observes and records the behaviour of wild chimpanzees in a forest reserve near Lake Tanganyika in Africa.

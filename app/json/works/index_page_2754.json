He&#8217;s invited to bring family and friends for company and the Rugrats find themselves in Paris. In an effort to gain a promotion and become company president, the child hating Coco makes a play for Chuckie&#8217;s hapless father Chas in a desperate attempt to win favour with the outgoing President. Only Angelica knows of Coco&#8217;s cunning plan and it&#8217;s up to the Rugrats to save Chas, imperilling a few famous landmarks along the way. Humorous throughout, the film has a strong sense of familial values and what constitutes &#8220;good&#8221; parenting. Features the voices of Susan Sarandon, John Lithgow, Debbie Reynolds, Christine Cavanaugh, Elizabeth Daily and Cheryl Chase.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - Germany", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/rugrats-in-paris", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2258048, "name": "Paul Demeyer", "creator_id": 52518, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q18542901", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258049, "name": "Stig Bergqvist", "creator_id": 80578, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3499421", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258042, "name": "Arlene Klasky", "creator_id": 80576, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2421429", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258044, "name": "Gabor Csupo", "creator_id": 80577, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q874828", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258035, "name": "GmbH and Co", "creator_id": 35918, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078897", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258031, "name": "MFP Munich Film Partners GmbH", "creator_id": 35917, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298931", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2258039, "name": "Rugrats Production KG", "creator_id": 35919, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271514", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2258028, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51855", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33503]}]}

Naturally, the internet didn’t take long to compare the New Shephard to the rocket launched by Dr Evil in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. While these jokes may seem throw-away moments of internet culture, they, like others referencing his recent divorce, use humour and absurdity to bring Bezos back down to earth.

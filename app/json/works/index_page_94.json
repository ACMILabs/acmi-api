Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 23 contains footage of the children&#8217;s display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (also seen in Reel 8).</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 23:</p>\n<p>The whole Reel is devoted to footage of the children&#8217;s display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (also seen in Reel 8, B2003230). 00:02:32:00 the Queen and Duke are seen getting out of car and walking across the grass, before the camera returns to the athletics, dancing, marching and costumes of the assembled children.

What emerges is a portrait of a man of incredible literary talent, fierce love and passion, loved by those of whom he gave his affection but ultimately denigrated by conservative society for his perceived amoral and hedonistic lifestyle.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Imprisonment", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900", "People&nbsp;→ Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/wilde", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 955831, "name": "Samuelson Entertainment", "creator_id": 29073, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7176765", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 955832, "name": "INDF International", "creator_id": 29074, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 955833, "name": "Marc Samuelson", "creator_id": 77850, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 955834, "name": "Peter Samuelson", "creator_id": 77851, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 955835, "name": "Brian Gilbert", "creator_id": 27118, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2924898", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 955830, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43544", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [26614], "external_references": [{"id": 2691, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q839825"}, {"id": 6629, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11365"}]}, {"id": 87720, "acmi_id": "309791", "title": "Wild things", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wild-things", "creator_credit": "Mandalay Entertainment, Rodney Liber, Steven A Jones and John McNaughton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Wild Things is a steamy thriller about two high school students, the guidance counsellor they accuse of rape, and the detective who suspects there&#8217;s more to the story.

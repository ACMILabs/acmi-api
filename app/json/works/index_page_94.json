The legend of Catholic mythology is here transformed into a psychological exploration of male sexuality with Sebastian as a homosexual icon. Jarman&#8217;s film was an innovative independent production for British cinema, its most unusual feature being its dialogue which is in Latin, thus avoiding the anachronisms and banalities of the dialogue in most historical films and the problems of deploying a multinational cast. The film was shot in just over three weeks in semi-improvisatory fashion. There is a subtext of Latin jokes and contemporary references. Cast includes Leonardo Treviglio, Barney James, Neil Kennedy and Richard Warwick.

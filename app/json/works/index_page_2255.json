In this unabashed performance she plays Countess Iriana of Karlstein, a mute vampire who resides on a remote island, feeding off men and women to satiate her desire to literally suck the life out of her lovers. Iriana faces a new challenge when she meets a poet who believes himself destined to become her lover and, like her, immortal. Simultaneously a scientist Dr. Roberts and his colleague, Dr. Orlof, become aware that a vampire is at work and set about finding him or her. &#8220;Female vampire&#8221; has a dream-like quality, and similar to &#8220;Vampyros Lesbos&#8221;, has achieved cult status amid horror buffs. Various cuts of this film exist; this version favours the sexuality of the characters over the more graphic horror elements.

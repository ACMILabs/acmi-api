Yin Qiong, a famous actress who immigrated to the States, comes at night and visits them in their dorm room. It turns out that this was once her room while she attended the school as a girl.

On the other hand, Yin Qiong recognises this is simply a fantasy, and she will always be herself.<br />\nThe exam period is seen by the girls with a heavy sense of ambivalence. They feel both regret at moving on, leaving the tragic shadow for those left behind, and the ambition to realise their own dreams for success and acceptance.

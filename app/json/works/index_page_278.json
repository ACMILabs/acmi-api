They disguise themselves as members of the ship&#8217;s personnel and are eventually let on board. At a group meeting with all in attendance, one of these stowaways, Kaowiec (Stanislaw Tym) is, to his surprise, introduced as the ship&#8217;s organiser of cultural and social activities. The passengers then give their opinion on everything from leisure activities to the question of giving opinions at all and a committee is formed to plan a group party. From this moment on, &#8220;A Trip Down the River&#8221; becomes a clear satire on processes of decision-making, structures of power, committee meetings and group dynamics. The main characters are a mixed bag, each with their own hilarious idiosyncrasies and quirks. Those passengers who comprise the party-committee represent a cross-section of Polish society - the rationalist, the artist, the philosopher, the pragmatist and so on - and so when each expresses their views, the film becomes a meta-narrative on various approaches to life and meaning. Acclaimed a cult film in post-war Poland, &#8220;A Trip Down the River&#8221; is a wry comedy that plays it straight all the way.

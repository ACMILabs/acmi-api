Francisco Manoel de Silva, an historical figure at the centre of the novel, is amalgamated with that of the bandit Cobra Verde to serve Herzog&#8217;s private mythologising. But Verde is not as distinctly drawn as the obsessive characters played by Klaus Kinski in &#8216;Aguirre&#8217; and &#8216;Fitzcarraldo&#8217;, the Herzog films with which Cobra Verde can be most directly compared. Loosely improvised and more of &#8216;a happening&#8217;, &#8216;Cobra Verde&#8217; has some extraordinary scenes and magnificent images. The historical issues of slavery and colonialism are typically (for Herzog) subsumed in a mystico-spiritual game. Cast also includes King Ampaw, Jose Lewgoy and Salvatore Basile. In German with English subtitles. Based on the novel &#8220;The Viceroy of Ouidah&#8221; by Bruce Chatwin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Seduction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Slave-trade - Africa", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/cobra-verde", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1970828, "name": "Werner Herzog", "creator_id": 4161, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q44131", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970827, "name": "Lucki Stipetic", "creator_id": 22865, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3838983", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970826, "name": "Ghana Film Industry Corporation", "creator_id": 12151, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970825, "name": "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen", "creator_id": 20976, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970824, "name": "Werner Herzog Filmproduktion", "creator_id": 22864, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45934", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [28449], "external_references": []}, {"id": 88958, "acmi_id": "311581", "title": "Ginger and Fred = Ginger e Fred", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ginger-and-fred-ginger-e-fred", "creator_credit": "Federico Fellini, Alberto Grimaldi and Produzioni Europee Associati", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1985", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Director Federico Fellini gently lampoons the world of television show-business in this film.

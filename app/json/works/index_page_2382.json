Nicholas recognised in her a unique talent for the piano and committed Francesca to years of relentless study in order for her to become a professional classical musician. Even as an adult Nicholas still wields enormous emotional power over Francesca, preventing her from realising true personal happiness. &#8220;The Seventh veil&#8221; is an intense psychodrama, which uses gothic sets and expressionistic lighting to convey a grave sense of mental torture for its principal characters. Winner of an Academy award for best original screenplay in 1947, this film was a box-office success in Britain.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Manipulative behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Conflict (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hypnotism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Manipulative behavior", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Oppression (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatric hospital care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998185, "name": "Compton Bennett", "creator_id": 25044, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q466415", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998184, "name": "Sydney Box", "creator_id": 14719, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2373669", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998182, "name": "Ortus Films", "creator_id": 35487, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998183, "name": "Theatrecraft", "creator_id": 35488, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998181, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51288", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1945", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1945"}], "labels": [33158]}, {"id": 93654, "acmi_id": "317180", "title": "Thirteen days = Thirteen days that shocked the world", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "thirteen-days-thirteen-days-that-shocked-the-world", "creator_credit": "Roger Donaldson, Armyan Bernstein, Kevin Costner, Mary Montiforte, Paul Deacon, Peter O Almond and Beacon Communications, Tig Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47210, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q128730"}], "brief_description": "<p>Based on the book &#8220;The Kennedy Tapes - inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis&#8221; by Ernest R.

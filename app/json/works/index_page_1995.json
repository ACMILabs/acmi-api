Upon arrival, the girls are instantly averse to their strange, rather grotesque new world, and decide to take matters into their own hands by attempting an escape and return home. Here begins the girls&#8217; seemingly eternal, epic journey across the harsh Australian desert landscape, with all odds against them except for a rabbit-proof fence as their guide home. In a moving finale, they are reunited with their mothers and, significantly, their culture. Though it is a specifically Australian story (the Stolen Generations and the White Australia Policy), director Phillip Noyce tells it in such a way that emphasises universal qualities of tragedy and heroism. He opts for an even-handed portrayal of the past, steering clear of images of oppression or subjugation and any chastising of White Culture, and instead emphasises optimism and survival. The film is adapted from a book of the same title by author, Doris Pilkington, daughter of the real-life Molly and &#8216;Stolen Generation&#8217; victim. Christopher Doyle&#8217;s photography and Peter Gabriel&#8217;s score give spiritual resonance to moments of emotional intensity, such as the tearing of children from their mothers, the crossing of a daunting barren landscape and the homecoming embrace between mother and daughter.

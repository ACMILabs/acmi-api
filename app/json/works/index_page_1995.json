Winner of the Golden Bear at Berlin in 1977.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>In the bitter cold winter of 1942, two partisan guerillas hunting for food are captured by Nazi troops. Locked up in a cell with three other peasants awaiting execution - a young girl, a mother and an old man - they face the tortured choice between collaboration or martyrdom. Filmed in illuminating black and white which recalls the poetics of silent Soviet cinema, in the frozen landscapes of Belorussia, &#8220;The Ascent&#8221; offers a passionate testament to the spiritual redemption possible through struggle and faith. In exploring compassionately the nature of collaboration and betrayal and in being an explicitly Christian allegory, the film was a controversial landmark of the Soviet &#8220;new wave&#8221;. Based on a novella by Vassil Bakov the film was the penultimate work of Shepitko, one of the leading women directors of inter- national cinema in the seventies.

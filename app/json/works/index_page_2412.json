Featuring glorious sets and art design, this musical has been honoured as one of the greatest of all movie musicals, winning the Palme d&#8217;Or in Cannes in 1964. The ravishing Deneuve has never been more beautiful and Castelnuovo is the epitome of Latin good looks - together they are one of the screen&#8217;s loveliest couples. This version of the film is based on the 1992 restoration by the French Ministry of Culture which faithfully restores the intense colour of the original.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Unwanted", "Foreign language films", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-umbrellas-of-cherbourg", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993333, "name": "Jacques Demy", "creator_id": 71620, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q312258", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993332, "name": "Mag Bodard", "creator_id": 71945, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3276488", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993331, "name": "Madeleine Films", "creator_id": 71483, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45939", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [28454]}, {"id": 88960, "acmi_id": "311583", "title": "A Short film about killing [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-short-film-about-killing-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Krzysztof Kieslowski and Zespoly Filmowe,Film Polski", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Poland, 1988", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 53462, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q72325"}], "brief_description": "<p>This previously unreleased feature length of Kieslowski&#8217;s A Short Film About Killing is a film about killing, murder, a drifter and corporal punishment.

Such is the premise of &#8220;Without a clue&#8221;. Fed up with Holmes&#8217; bad form, Watson attempts to branch out on his own as the &#8216;Crime Doctor&#8217;, only to be told that it&#8217;s Holmes the people want. Thus, Holmes and Watson are forced to join sides again on a case involving counterfeit 5 pound notes. All is progressing well until the appearance of Holmes/Watson&#8217;s nemesis, Professor Moriaty, then Watson disappears into the canal - presumed dead, and it&#8217;s up to the oft inebriated Holmes to solve his first case, unassisted, and prove his crime solving capacity to the dubious Inspector Lestrade.

Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, titled &#8216;Just Roaming&#8217;, Ted tells the story of a road trip through Victoria. The Parsons travel through Mount Hotham and Myrtleford, down to Melbourne and then back through Bairnsdale and Paynesville on the south coast.</p>\n<p>A feature is the footage of the Gliding Club of Victoria, including female pilots, and historic buildings in Melbourne such as the Shrine of Remembrance and Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. There are beautiful scenes of the Victorian countryside throughout.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 title cards &#8216;E.J.

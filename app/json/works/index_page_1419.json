regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

The films show life in Melbourne including the 1956 Olympic Games, a fishing trip to Bermagui in NSW, and holidays in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This film is titled&#8217; Eastern Tour 1939&#8217; and begins with footage of a passenger liner departing from Sydney Harbour farewelled by waving onlookers and streamers. We see Sydney Harbour and images of the Whitsundays along the way. The highlight of this film is the footage of Bali in 1939. We see Balinese people in a traditional canoe, juking or cadik, paddle alongside the ship as it arrives in Bali. Once on land, there are images of temples, rice terraces, farmers, and a Balinese market with traders plying their trade. There are local people buying food from the stallholders and busying themselves around the market and socialising.

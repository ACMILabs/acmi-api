In this film, Rev. Edward Dawson is asked by a farm couple to advise their son George against leaving the land in favor of a factory job in the city. Mr. Dawson finds a parallel between George&#8217;s problem and his own, for he too must choose between a city church and his rural calling. He is given cause to re-examine the stewardship with which he is entrusted and in it finds an answer both for himself and for George.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:28:30:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Canada - Rural conditions", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Farm life", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Farm life - Canada", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canada - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 852597, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 852598, "name": "Julian Biggs", "creator_id": 11899, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 852599, "name": "Fergus McDonell", "creator_id": 74252, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 852596, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23966", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [7826]}, {"id": 99144, "acmi_id": "509208", "title": "The Harp in the South [a discussion]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-harp-in-the-south-a-discussion", "creator_credit": "Country Education Project and Barry Washington", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Ruth Park&#8217;s social documentary is the basis for this program hosted by Richard McRoberts.

Having been late to the ceremony for choosing Pokemon, Ash is left with the last Pokemon, an electric rat Pokemon called Pikachu. After a bumpy start the two learn to work as a team to fight off a flock of Spearows: aggressive flying Pokemon. The second episode, entitled &#8220;Pokemon Emergency!&#8221; continues from the end of the battle with the Spearows in which Pikachu is badly hurt. Ash then has to rush his Pokemon to the special Pokemon hospital. While Ash waits for Pikachu to recover, the hospital is attacked by Team Rocket, an evil team of Pokemon thieves. Pikachu recovers just in time to work with Ash to scare off Team Rocket. Ash then continues on his quest to become a Pokemon master followed by Misty, a young girl who helped him save Pikachu. In third episode, entitled &#8220;Ash Catches a Pokemon&#8221;, Ash manages to catch his very first Pokemon, a big Pokemon called Caterpie. While Misty does not like Caterpie to begin with, things start to change after Caterpie saves the day when Team Rocket attempts another attack on Ash, Pikachu and Misty. Pokemon the series is based the Nintendo game of the same name.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Japan", "Animation&nbsp;→ Anime", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - Japan", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Computer games", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Games"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 906882, "name": "Masamitsu Hidaka", "creator_id": 29504, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906881, "name": "Takamoto Mori", "creator_id": 78550, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906880, "name": "Takayuki Yanagisawa", "creator_id": 78549, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906879, "name": "Keisuke Iwata", "creator_id": 78548, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906878, "name": "4 Kids Productions", "creator_id": 29500, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906877, "name": "Shogakukan Production Co Ltd", "creator_id": 29499, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 906876, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43918", "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26969]}, {"id": 93708, "acmi_id": "317289", "title": "Pokemon the first movie: Mewtwo strikes back", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "pokemon-the-first-movie-mewtwo-strikes-back", "creator_credit": "Michael Haigney, Kunihiko Yuyama, Norman J Grossfeld, Takemoto Mori, Tomoyuki Igarashi, Choji Yoshikawa, 4 Kids Productions and Pikachu Project '98", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1997", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6YPzBcMH0aPNTvdXNCDLY0zdE1g.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Preceding the feature length Pokemon movie is a short animated Pokemon story called &#8220;Pikachu&#8217;s vacation&#8221; which really appears to be void of any substantial plot and is somewhat difficult to follow, particularly as there is not a lot of English narration accompanying the action.

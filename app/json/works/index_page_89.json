An aristocratic Japanese patron, who is impressed by Gilbert&#8217;s ability to amuse her depressed and reclusive young nephew Robert, saves Gilbert&#8217;s career from obscurity. Smitten with Gilbert, Robert causes an international diplomatic incident by following him back to the US. Even though it occasionally lapses into sentimental mawkishness, this film features much physical comedy as well as the usual mugging typical of Lewis&#8217; schtick. &#8220;The Geisha boy&#8221; is one of director Tashlin&#8217;s eight collaborations with comedian Jerry Lewis (others include The Disorderly, Hollywood or bust, Who&#8217;s minding the store?).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Children - Japan - Social life and customs", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Slapstick comedies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Attachment behavior in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Japan - Social life and customs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-geisha-boy", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997792, "name": "Frank Tashlin", "creator_id": 25516, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q589459", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997791, "name": "Jerry Lewis", "creator_id": 27111, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q294927", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997790, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997789, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51031", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1958", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1958"}], "labels": [32969], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93465, "acmi_id": "316907", "title": "Hollywood or bust", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hollywood-or-bust", "creator_credit": "Frank Tashlin, Hal B.

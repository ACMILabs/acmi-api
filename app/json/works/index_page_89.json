This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film is made up of two distinct parts, both showing off the beauty and destinations of Tasmania and both capturing the courtship and marriage of the main people in the films, Val and Len.</p>\n<p>In the first part, Kenneth uses a series of ‘intertitle’ cards to introduce his viewers to a conversation between ‘Valerie Sparks’ and ‘Len Couchman’ about Tasmania, which is ‘beyond the blue horizon’. What follows is a scenic tour of Tasmania interjected by moments of Valerie and Len sitting on a bench looking out to sea, continuing to talk of Tasmania over the course of a few days. During these chats, Valerie and Len become closer and end the first part of the film with arms around each other’s shoulders.</p>\n<p>The second part of the film, title card ‘KenRa Films Present’ appears before we see Valerie and then Len in close-ups followed by title card, ‘Val. and Len.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters.

"<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good. The sound drops out early in the film for several seconds and is a little hard to understand at times.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 titles &#8216;The Walkabouters&#8217;, &#8216;Werribee Gorge Nov 1972&#8217;<br />\n00:01:13:00 putting up camping tents<br />\n00:01:37:00 taking a break at a picnic table near a campfire, possibly drinking wine from wine flagons<br />\n00:01;53:00 cooking sausages on a barbeque iron plate over the open flames, sitting in 1970s style folding chairs<br />\n00:02:02:00 an old utility style truck with participants packed in the back as other participants set off walking<br />\n00:02:38:00 assisting each other as hikers are traversing a rocky creek and bending under the barbed wire of a farm fence while others hold wire up<br />\n00:03:51:00 using cameras and binoculars while listening to a guide or club member talking about the Gorge, followed by precarious crossing over water by using an old fallen tree<br />\n00:04:50:00 views around the landscape<br />\n00:06:05:00 hikers rest among the trees<br />\n00:08:10:00 views around the landscape and from a higher vantage point down to the river and tents<br />\n00:09:16:00 getting rock samples<br />\n00:09:50:00 views of the Werribee River and the rocky steep banks<br />\n00:10:15:00 views along the river, rocky outcrops and trickling waterfalls<br />\n00:11:09:00 preparing a meal back at base camp<br />\n00:12:12:00 eggs and bacon cooking on the open fire and a view of the tents<br />\n00:12:49:00 clambering over a farm gate<br />\n00:12:58:00 horses and cows<br />\n00:14:12:00 a colourful bug on a leaf<br />\n00:15:12:00 soaking tired feet in the creek<br />\n00:18:40:00 sign for &#8216;Blackwood Pottery&#8217; followed by the pottery studio<br />\n00:19:15:00 views around the studio and potters at their wheels<br />\n00:20:15:00 the pottery kiln<br />\n00:21:31:00 an old cement camp fireplace barbeque with billies boiling and meat cooking<br />\n00:21:49:00 serving the billy tea at a park picnic table<br />\n00:22:08:00 eating the barbequed chops in bread, sleeping under a tree and photographing the scenery<br />\n00:23:53:00 close-ups of wildflowers<br />\n00:25:17:00 outdoor eating back at the tents<br />\n00:25:26:00 canoeing down the river<br />\n00:26:09:00 title &#8216;The End&#8217;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 28]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

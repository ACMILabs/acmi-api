An intimate series of interviews with some of the big names in piano blues music in America with director, and fellow pianist, Clint Eastwood. Starting out with Ray Charles and featuring clips and photographs of musicians of the last century, Eastwood&#8217;s journey is sure to inspire a new generation as he asks &#8220;Who were your influences&#8230;?&#8221; Whilst guitar seems to take centre stage in modern blues, it could be argued that it was piano that lead to the popularisation of the form with hit makers such as Ray Charles, Fats Domino and Duke Ellington leading the way. Refreshingly includes some footage and interviews with female musicians. Some of the legends seen performing are: Ray Charles, Dr. John, Fats Domino, Prof. Longhair, Nat King Cole, Dave Brubeck, Marcia Ball, Jay McShann, Art Tatum, Big Joe Turner and Duke Ellington among

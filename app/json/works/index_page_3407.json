In its focus on the advocates of human cloning, such as Clone Rights United Front and the religious cult with visions of duplicating their leader&#8217;s genes, the Raelians, the program raises numerous questions about the narcissistic fantasies of these groups. Through interviews with and discussions between, among others, biologists, geneticists, a psychoanalyst, and a philosopher the ethical issues crucial to the cloning debate are outlined.

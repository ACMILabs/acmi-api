The eldest, wayward Bobby is in the Glens, Alan, the artistic middle son is in love with the girl downstairs, and the youngest son Lex is creating the most cause for concern when he accidentally shoots the leader of the Tongs, mental Malky (Kevin McKidd), in the eye with an air rifle. The actions of Lex draw in Alan, the last of the MacLeans to be involved in the Glen/Tong animosity, setting a momentum they cannot control and forcing the brothers to question their loyalty between family and friends. Their story is set against a strong home environment, one in which their mother is acutely aware of their heritage and a time when things were better, yet also devoid of obvious male role models as Lex is torn between Alan and Bobby, and Bobby turning to the Glens without question. Cast includes Claire Higgins, Iain Robertson, Joseph McFadden and Laura Fraser.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Glasgow (Scotland)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Scotland - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Sociology, Urban", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Places&nbsp;→ Glasgow (Scotland)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/small-faces", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957946, "name": "Skyline Easterhouse Ltd (Glasgow)", "creator_id": 31072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957947, "name": "Billy MacKinnon", "creator_id": 23328, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957948, "name": "Billy MacKinnon", "creator_id": 23328, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957949, "name": "Steve Clark-Hall", "creator_id": 78709, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957950, "name": "Gillies MacKinnon", "creator_id": 31073, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957945, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46144", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [28640], "external_references": [{"id": 2411, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3486843"}, {"id": 5421, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "42758"}]}, {"id": 87752, "acmi_id": "309834", "title": "Sliding doors", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sliding-doors", "creator_credit": "Paramount Pictures, Miramax Films, Sydney Pollack, Philippa Braithwaite, William Horberg and Peter Howitt", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Losing her job triggers a strange turn of events for Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) when she discovers two possibilities for her future.

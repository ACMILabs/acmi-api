Refuting the bourgeois narratives of modernism, the richly sensuous trilogy was Pasolini&#8217;s attempt to return to a folkloric and pre-modern storytelling tradition rooted in the oral traditions of the peasantry. Filmed in stunning locations in the Africa, Asia and the Middle East, &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; consists of tales within tales, a weaving of fairy stories all connected by their illustration of the intrinsic power of the human search for love and sex. Utilising a circular device based on the original stories of the &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221;, the film begins with Aziz (Ninnetto Davoli) falling in love with Zumarud (Ines Pellegrini). When they are separated by the evil machinations of a slave dealer, Aziz begins a search for his lost love. As he journeys he encounters other lovelorn characters who tell him the stories of their obsessions: a young man frees a woman from a jinn and the demon pursues him; a shipwrecked sailor discovers a hidden treasure; a man about to marry becomes obsessed with a stranger and demands his fiancee to facilitate his new love; Zumarud herself escapes her tormenters and, mistaken for a boy, she is crowned King of an empire. Though sexually explicit and erotic, &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; is distinguished by an optimism and delight in the imagery and history of the Orient that celebrates the innocence and magic of a pre-industrial age. Refusing the colonialist identification of Arab and Oriental society with sexual repression and ignorance, Pasolini affirms the sensual and complex civilisations of the pre-Talmudic and pre-Koranic worlds. Set amongst some of the most spectacular architectural monuments and cityscapes of the Islamic and Buddhist world, the film is a continuous feast for all the senses. After this almost dreamlike celebration of innocence, Pasolini was to direct his final film, &#8220;Salo&#8221;, which examining the brave new world of the twentieth century, was to see him reverse the optimism of his &#8220;Trilogy of Life&#8221; and create one of the bleakest and most pessimistic motion pictures ever made. But in &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221;, it is innocence and magic and the language of dreams which is paramount.

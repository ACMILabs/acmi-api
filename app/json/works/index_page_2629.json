Seen through the not-so-innocent eyes of 10 year-old Robert Ah Louey, the film captures the social attitudes of the 1950&#8217;s, the cultural nuances of neighbours on either side of the fence, and in the process saying something of what it was like being Chinese in Australia during the 50&#8217;s. Cast includes Adam Gungor (Robert), Terry Woo (Uncle Walter), Genevieve Mooy (Dolores O&#8217;Halloran), Peter Whitford (Jack O&#8217;Halloran).

While fighting the suspect in the chamber, the chef constable Tie Zhongjie is shot by a broken arrow filled with poison.

However, during one hunting game, the most hopeful candidate to become Regent, the King of Ji&#8217;jou, is murdered likewise by an arrows shot from nowhere, the poison once again appearing to be Erysipelas. On the other side of town, Ru&#8217;nan King is chasing courtesans at a brothel, where he is victimized by the same Erysipelas poison.</p>\n<p>The King of Duan&#8217;zhou suspects that it is the three Han sisters&#8217; doings avenging the death of their father. He dispatches troops to destroy their white stallion fortress, while kidnapping the older sister Fei as hostage. Two younger sisters Yiyun and Caiyun vow to rescue her. While on their attempt breaking into the King of Duan&#8217;zhou&#8217;s palace, they are ambushed by palace guards. Fortunately, they were saved by masked swordsman during critical moments, allowing them to escape the palace walls.

But Dorothea has her feckless younger sister to consider. How can she extricate her from a destructive love affair? This seems to be Dorothea&#8217;s problem. &#8216;Desperate Remedies&#8217; is the story of inhabitants trapped in the nightmarish colonial town called Hope, trying to outwit each other, bargaining, plotting, playing cat and mouse, fighting for what they desire most: all the time poised to accept their own desperate remedy. Cast includes Kevin Smith, Jennifer Ward-Lealand, Lisa Chappell, Kevin Smith and Clifford Curtis and Michael Hurst.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Historical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2188087, "name": "Peter Wells", "creator_id": 9656, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7177645", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188090, "name": "Stewart Main", "creator_id": 21577, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q63991498", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188084, "name": "James H.

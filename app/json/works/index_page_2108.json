Focuses on the collection and treatment of seeds, and how careful management of these natural resources will benefit both people and the environment in the future. In Part three, &#8220;From wild woods to town gardens&#8221;, Dick and the woodland expert Oliver Rackham discuss the concept of the wild wood as opposed to the plantation, and go in search of rare species of native trees. Dick then compares the wild wood to the town garden, examining why people often overlook native trees in urban spaces. With Simon Hodge from the Forestry Commission, he scrutinises examples of good and bad tree planting, and offers general advice to people wishing to plant trees. In Part four, &#8220;A Dying breed&#8221;, Dick visits Bill Hogarth, one of the last remaining coppice woodsmen in the Lake District, and reveals the commercial potential in this old form of woodland management. Dick also speaks to Walter Lloyd, who has restored the ancient tradition of making charcoal (and wooden tent pegs) from coppice wood. In &#8220;The Folklore of Trees&#8221;, filmed in Ireland and England, Dick explores the perpetuation of customs and superstitions incorporating trees that can be traced back to pagan times, and looks at modern spirituality and rituals associated with tree worship. He visits a Money Tree, holy wells and the sacred trees that guard them, examines the folkloric traditions connecting trees and May Day, and hears first hand accounts of the superstitions surrounding the rowan, or &#8220;fairy&#8221; tree.

In &#8220;History of Trees&#8221;, Dick tracks down ancient trees and the importance of tree ring analysis for both dating objects for archeologists and documenting environment alteration. He visits the remarkable Bristlecone pines in the White Mountains, California, the ancient Limes of Coniston, North West England, and looks at the significance of the placement of ancient Yew trees in relation to churches.

Born of French parents but growing up among Arabs, Camus&#8217; exploration of the agony of human separation reflects his own dichotomous identity. This film also includes a filmed conversation with the writer in which he talks about his love for theatre, football and the importance of achieving personal happiness in a world in which we are condemned to suffer the agonising silence of the unknown Universe. Excerpts from his novels and essays are read throughout the film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Existentialism", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors - 20th century", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors, French", "Literature&nbsp;→ French literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Novelists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Camus, Albert, 1913-1960", "People&nbsp;→ Novelists - Biography", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 827678, "name": "Georges Rouquier", "creator_id": 17796, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2354287", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1808230, "name": "Fred Orjain", "creator_id": 38161, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 827676, "name": "Learning Corporation of America", "creator_id": 12155, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034374", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "55103", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1971", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1971"}], "labels": [36380]}, {"id": 76762, "acmi_id": "014855", "title": "Albany whaling", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "albany-whaling", "creator_credit": "Barrie Pattison and Carmelo Musca", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Recounts the history of whaling on Australia&#8217;s West Coast with rare footage from early twentieth century to the last whale to be taken by the Cheynes Beach company.

Originally produced for New York&#8217;s Chase Manhattan Plaza, this work contrasts serene natural images from a highly cultivated Japanese garden with the hard-edged architectural landscape of Manhattan. Lucier finds formal parallels to the sensual flowers and calm pools in the cool, silvery reflections of the steel and glass skyscrapers. The dichotomy between natural and urban landscape is mirrored in Earl Howard&#8217;s haunting score, which shifts from the ringing of wind chimes to the magnified ambient sounds of the city street.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:11:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["video, 6 monitors, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 936563, "name": "Lower Manhattan Cultural Council", "creator_id": 6397, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 936559, "name": "Mary Lucier", "creator_id": 6393, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 936564, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 936562, "name": "Gregg Featherman", "creator_id": 73089, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 936561, "name": "Earl Howard", "creator_id": 73088, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 936560, "name": "Earl Howard", "creator_id": 73088, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "113", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [47443]}, {"id": 90855, "acmi_id": "313896", "title": "Winterfun Canada", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "winterfun-canada", "creator_credit": "Pat Crawley, Jim Turpie and Crawley Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film is a lively mosaic of how Canadians use winter as a source of recreation and entertainment.

Theo, a projectionist in the local theatre, steals a car belonging to lovers Rebecca and Marco and takes it for a joyride.

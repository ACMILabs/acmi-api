This one night stand has serious repercussions for Katharina who is brought in for police questioning. Her basic civil rights ignored at every turn, Katharina is relentlessly grilled about her relationship with her one-night stand. As a result she loses her job, her friends, and her standing in the community. Unsatisfied with this, the police go after Katharina&#8217;s family. Her story is also exploited by the &#8216;yellow press&#8217;, which hounds her and depicts her as everything from loose woman to communist moll. And so, through the mirror of a manipulative press, Katharina becomes the most hated woman in Germany. The film achieves a compelling portrait of Germany in the mid-seventies (the lead years), during which the fight against the Red Army Faction led a number of State agencies to use any means possible to fight terrorism, while a manipulative right wing press sent an entire country in a frenzy over the breakdown of law and order. This originally made for TV production is adapted from the novel by Heinrich Boll (itself based on actual events).

This time round, Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell reprising her role) is at college trying to put the Woodsboro murders behind her, that is until a series of campus murders aping the killings of the first film make it clear that someone is planning a sequel of their own. Director Wes Craven, (no slouch to the genre himself having made &#8216;Nightmare on Elm St&#8217; and &#8216;The Hills have Eyes&#8217;) and writer Kevin Williamson inject fresh &#8216;blood&#8217; into the formula by presenting a group of characters to care for (not just a bunch of disposable, horny teens), and by not sacrificing the frights for the sake of a cheap laugh, a common malady of contemporary horror. Cast includes David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Heather Graham, Jamie Kennedy, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry O&#8217;Connell, Liev Schreiber and Jada Pinkett.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murderers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1991797, "name": "Wes Craven", "creator_id": 72694, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q223992", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991796, "name": "Marianne Maddalena", "creator_id": 78551, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4216222", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991795, "name": "Cathy Konrad", "creator_id": 72695, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2942203", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991794, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1991793, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43925", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [26975], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87480, "acmi_id": "309426", "title": "Street of shame = Akasen chitai [NTSC]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "street-of-shame-akasen-chitai-ntsc", "creator_credit": "Kenji Mizoguchi, Masaichi Nagata, Daiei Motion Picture Company and Janus Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1956", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1956-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The setting is a Tokyo brothel, ironically called Dreamland.

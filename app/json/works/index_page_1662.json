Qiuyue sends Tiangui back to his parents, who joined the revolution in the early years and are now senior officials living in the city. Tiangui’s mother is excited to see her son and arrange everything for him to begin a new life. Tiangui is not comfortable with the easy life and misses his foster mum and fiancée in the country. Tiangui’s mother tries all means to prevent her son going back, and she wants Tiangui to marry the daughter of a colleague. Noticing the problem, Tiangui’s father blames his wife and asks Tiangui to invite Qiuyue and Cuicui to their home. However, Tiangui’s mother sends a letter to Qiuyue, telling her that only Cuicui is invited. Tiangui would not go without Qiuyue, and Qiuyue eventually compromises. At Tiangui’s home, Qiuyue accidentally finds out that Tiangui’s parents are the couple that she saved years ago. She did not tell the truth to her children but chose to leave without letting anybody know.</p>\n<p>Similar to The Green Mountain of Bamboo (1982), this film also deals with young people’s free love. Traditionally in China, a couple’s marriage would be arranged by their parents. Very often, the couple would have no chance to meet with each other before their wedding day. Arranged marriage is regarded as a “feudal concept” and thus criticized by the CCP. Produced in the early 1980s, this film delivers a message to the audience that CCP members must not be corrupted by feudal ideas.

As the film progresses their own personal stories unfold, explaining not only their backgrounds and reasons for taking on this role, but also the social stigmas associated with single mothers, adoption, orphans and the lack of a support network for those in desperate need of loving care but are denied it.</p>\n<p>The moral of the film, like most others of the period, is that human beings are inherently good, and should therefore be prepared to compromise with the shortcomings and difficulties in associating with others. However, it also touches a much deeper and more fundamental nerve that stretches across all barriers, that society can only function humanely if its people remember their own natural desire to love and be loved, despite the risks of pain engendered through such ventures.  With that said, viewers should not expect to be thoroughly entertained, as the film is often rather tedious and dry.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 6, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Childrens Films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homeless children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aggressiveness (Psychology) in children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2650756, "name": "Lu Ping", "creator_id": 82381, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159965", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650760, "name": "Wang Hanchang", "creator_id": 82384, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036359", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650755, "name": "Children's Film Studio (China)", "creator_id": 82253, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126798", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2650761, "name": "Cheng Xiaolong", "creator_id": 82385, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271445", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650763, "name": "Ding Jiali", "creator_id": 82273, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8948276", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650764, "name": "Fang Fang", "creator_id": 82387, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298812", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650762, "name": "Qiao Chen", "creator_id": 82386, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223555", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650765, "name": "Zhang Xi", "creator_id": 82261, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086156", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650759, "name": "Wang Jiuwen", "creator_id": 82374, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121085973", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650766, "name": "Shanghai Film Orchestra", "creator_id": 82388, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361210", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650757, "name": "Wang Xingdong", "creator_id": 82382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650758, "name": "Wang Zhebin", "creator_id": 82383, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146408", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [55256]}]}

Cast includes Jim Broadbent, Richard Roxburgh, John Leguizamo, Garry McDonald, Christine Anu, Kylie Minogue, David Wenham and Kerry Walker.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de, 1864-1901", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitutes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de, 1864-1901", "Places&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960843, "name": "Baz Luhrmann", "creator_id": 67882, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960842, "name": "Fred Baron", "creator_id": 56037, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960841, "name": "Baz Luhrmann", "creator_id": 67882, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960840, "name": "Martin Brown", "creator_id": 56034, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960839, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960838, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19644, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xhuQz2yKPlWvMvvnf2u9RVkAQx6.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Moulin Rouge (Baz Luhrmann) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 800, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50051", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32061]}, {"id": 70621, "acmi_id": "007299", "title": "Moulding with a three-part flask", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "moulding-with-a-three-part-flask", "creator_credit": "United States.

Unfortunately, like everything else in Sunnydale High, gateway to the hellmouth, Oz has teen issues of the supernatural kind (Ep. 15, Phases). Love is also in the air for Zander (Nicholas Brendan) as he hooks up with the &#8216;cliquey&#8217; Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), an unlikely paring which results in much bitchy repartee (Ep. 10, What&#8217;s my line, Part two). Aside from a new slayer unexpectedly arriving on the scene (Ep. 9, What&#8217;s my line, Part One), season two&#8217;s biggest surprise ended up being the transformation of Buffy&#8217;s &#8216;soulful&#8217; vampire boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz) into the uber evil, Angelus (Ep. 13, Surprise and Ep. 14, Innocence). This causes the love struck Buffy much grief as she has to make some difficult and painful decisions (Ep. 22, Becoming, Part two). Meanwhile, Angelus makes it his personal mission to make the slayer&#8217;s life hell (Ep. 17, Passion), while joining forces with Spike and Drusilla as they attempt to awaken a demon that will suck the world into hell (Ep. 21, Becoming, Part one and Eps. 22, Becoming, Part two).

This was the year that Buffy the Vampire slayer&#8217;s popularity went from small cult following to full blown media event, gaining some of the highest ratings the show has ever had in the US. Season two also saw the introduction of the cool and mysterious Oz (Seth Green), who became a &#8216;Scooby gang&#8217; regular and a potential love interest for Willow. Unfortunately, like everything else in Sunnydale High, gateway to the hellmouth, Oz has teen issues of the supernatural kind (Ep. 15, Phases). Love is also in the air for Zander (Nicholas Brendan) as he hooks up with the &#8216;cliquey&#8217; Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), an unlikely pairing which results in much bitchy repartee (Ep. 10, What&#8217;s my line, Part two).

Harry grows from a boy in uniform to a man in war. We watch as he learns of his impending death and how he faces it. &#8216;Harry&#8217;s War&#8217; is about when mateship transcends race, cultural differences and social barriers. It is a story of how war drives men to the brink and the journey becomes more important than the journey&#8217;s end.

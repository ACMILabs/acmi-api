It looks like a simple case but a methodical US Navy lawyer (Demi Moore) is keen to investigate the killing, convinced that the bashing was a result of a &#8220;Code Red&#8221;, an unofficial system of bastardry which aims to convert the young marines into effective fighting machines. &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221; is a detective story, a film about responsibility and conduct, and it features some powerful and adrenalin-pumping courtroom drama. Tom Cruise is suitably boyish and charming as a maverick Navy lawyer and Jack Nicholson is outstanding as a US General arrogantly convinced of his superiority and power.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Navies", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Courtroom films and programs", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-few-good-men", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2068246, "name": "Rob Reiner", "creator_id": 24063, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q287607", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2068244, "name": "Andrew Scheinman", "creator_id": 77060, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q507189", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2068241, "name": "David Brown", "creator_id": 3944, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q369175", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2068240, "name": "Rob Reiner", "creator_id": 24063, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q287607", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2068239, "name": "Castle Rock Entertainment", "creator_id": 52854, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2068238, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2068233, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41039", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [24551]}, {"id": 85060, "acmi_id": "306424", "title": "The Incredible shrinking man", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-incredible-shrinking-man", "creator_credit": "Jack Arnold, Albert Zugsmith and Universal Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1957", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44425, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q972001"}], "brief_description": "<p>This low-budget feature is a powerful and perverse example of American Cold War cinema.

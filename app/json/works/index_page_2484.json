Thanks to some aerial fishing though, their mission is successful and the parachuting groomsmen make it in time for the wedding. The happy couple are soon devastated however when Sanchez escapes and kills the bride and maims the groom as payback. This triggers best buddy James (Timothy Dalton) to relinquish his secret service status and licence to kill authority (Bond is under orders to complete another mission) as he embarks on a personal vendetta to revenge Sanchez&#8217;s brutality towards his friends.

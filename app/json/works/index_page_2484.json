Millions of people were accused of &#8220;crimes against the state&#8221; and forced to sign confessions in show trials which only added to the growing societal hysteria. In interviews with both survivors and administrators of the &#8220;purges&#8221;, we see how the use of informers and the secret police led to a social order of mistrust where neigbour turned on neighbour and sibling on sibling. Filmed in the old city of Leningrad this powerful documentary shows how the purges, with their subsequant tortures, imprisonments and violence are still the cause of deep anguish for contemporary Russians.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Russian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Leningrad (R.S.F.S.R.)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communist party purges", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Human rights", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Torture victims", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Paranoia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Paranoia", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Communist party purges", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Soviet Union - History - 1925-1953", "History&nbsp;→ Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953", "People&nbsp;→ Stalin, Joseph, 1879-1953", "Places&nbsp;→ Leningrad (R.S.F.S.R.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1104669, "name": "October Films", "creator_id": 53950, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104670, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104671, "name": "Angus MacQueen", "creator_id": 77755, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104672, "name": "Tom Roberts", "creator_id": 77754, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104673, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 74135, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1104668, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115434, "acmi_id": "S01237", "title": "The Hand of Stalin", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-hand-of-stalin", "creator_credit": "October Films, British Broadcasting Corporation, Tom Roberts and John Walker", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1990", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 84918, "acmi_id": "306261", "title": "Kolyma", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kolyma", "creator_credit": "October Films, BBC, Tom Roberts, Angus MacQueen and Murray Battle", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1990", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 84916, "acmi_id": "306259", "title": "Leningradskaya: a village in southern Russia", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "leningradskaya-a-village-in-southern-russia", "creator_credit": "October Films, BBC, Tom Roberts and John Walker", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1990", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40884", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [24407]}]}

The film&#8217;s point is that maths includes all activities if teachers know where to look for opportunities to teach it, using experiences that interest and totally involve the children. Explores thematic approach to mathematics. Begins with an in-service program for infant teachers. They construct a mural and then proceed to discover maths in it. A class teacher in a school situation then adopts the same approach using the theme &#8216;buses&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education, Primary", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Games in mathematics education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Study and teaching", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Juvenile films", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics - Study and teaching", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1807442, "name": "John Arnold", "creator_id": 2032, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 826793, "name": "A Graphic Film", "creator_id": 16571, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 826795, "name": "John Krish", "creator_id": 13969, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "54720", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1971", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1971"}], "labels": [36000], "external_references": []}, {"id": 114852, "acmi_id": "S00477", "title": "Maths Matters", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maths-matters", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Maths Matters</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Unknown</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 76633, "acmi_id": "014701", "title": "Maths Without Numbers (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maths-without-numbers-tefc", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "57997", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 179, "name": "Unknown", "slug": "unknown"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [54346], "external_references": []}, {"id": 70201, "acmi_id": "006829", "title": "Maths is a monster", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maths-is-a-monster", "creator_credit": "Eileen Molony and British Broadcasting Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Discovery and Experience&#8221;.<br />\nConsiders the effect the research of Jean Piaget has had on the teaching of mathematics.

Her journey took her to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. She wanted to know why there was so much hatred towards America. Was it religious - Muslims against Christians - or were there other reasons for this apparent hatred? And yet for all the hatred and anger towards America, many Arabs expressed sympathy for the American people and made it clear that they did not condone terrorism or what occurred on September 11. The United States however is accused of interference and domination, hypocrisy and double standards, exploiting the Middle East for its oil and using their land for its military bases - 27,000 American military personnel are currently based in the desert of Egypt. This documentary presents a Muslim perspective from the street Arabs to the intelligentsia and includes interviews with Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Youssef (&#8220;The Storm&#8221;), Iraqui musician Naseer Shamma, Palestinian journalist Atef Helwa, Sheik Nahyan one of the ruling elite in the United Arab Emirates, various academics and and a group of American Christian students on a study tour of the Middle East. Also discusses America&#8217;s close relationship with Israel, its past occupations, bombings and economic exploitations which have affected many countries around the world, but particularly the Islamic countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Palestine.

Playwright and critic Bonnie Greer was born in Chicago. She then spent several years working in New York before moving to London where she has spent the last 15 years working in theatre and writing. Bonnie decided to go home to America to talk to family and friends about September 11 and whether it has changed their feelings about America and being American. Through her interviews with members of her family (Black American, middle-class), her priest, university students, friends and co-workers from the past, Bonnie discovered that if Americans were arrogant, it was an arrogance born out of ignorance and that since September 11, many Americans were beginning to do some soul-searching and treating the terrorist attack as a wake-up call. The common thread appears to be a feeling of powerlessness and a lack of information being passed on to the general population by all aspects of the media and the Government. Education is so insular and parochial that young students do not even know where Pakistan or Afghanistan are on the map. Television broadcasts appear to be more for entertainment rather than providing for any analytical value. This documentary, along with &#8220;Letter to America&#8221;, certainly provides the viewer an opportunity to see and hear two differing attitudes and opinions from just everyday people at opposite ends of the spectrum - religiously and politically. But are they so different? And can people change? It seems at the end of the day that all most people want is peace and to live without fear.

Playwright and critic Bonnie Greer was born in Chicago. She then spent several years working in New York before moving to London where she has spent the last 15 years working in theatre and writing. Bonnie decided to go home to America to talk to family and friends about September 11 and whether it has changed their feelings about America and being American. Through her interviews with members of her family (Black American, middle-class), her priest, university students, friends and co-workers from the past, Bonnie discovered that if Americans were arrogant, it was an arrogance born out of ignorance and that since September 11, many Americans were beginning to do some soul-searching and treating the terrorist attack as a wake-up call. The common thread appears to be a feeling of powerlessness and a lack of information being passed on to the general population by all aspects of the media and the Government. Education is so insular and parochial that young students do not even know where Pakistan or Afghanistan are on the map. Television broadcasts appear to be more for entertainment rather than providing for any analytical value. This documentary, along with &#8220;Letter to America&#8221;, certainly provides the viewer an opportunity to see and hear two differing attitudes and opinions from just everyday people at opposite ends of the spectrum - religiously and politically. But are they so different? And can people change? It seems at the end of the day that all most people want is peace and to live without fear.

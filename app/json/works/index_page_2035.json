The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains snippets of scenes from travels around Victoria. Firstly the Hume Dam (formerly Hume Weir) which is a major dam across the Murray River in New South Wales. Constructed between 1919 and 1936 and involving hydro-power as well as flood mitigation and irrigation, the Hume Dam would have been a major attraction at the time, the 1940s.

"<p>George William Malins (1910–2007) was an amateur filmmaker who made home movies in Australia and overseas from the 1940s to 1970s. According to his daughter, George was ‘optimistic, happy and enthusiastic’, an outlook reflected in his films which are a history of home life and a love of travel.</p>\n<p>George came to Australia from England as a young man by way of the merchant navy, after having seen South America and some of Asia. He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows the Malins family in a montage of holidays and events in Victoria spanning several years from 1946 to the 1950s (not in precise chronological order). Highlights include a visit to Melbourne Zoo, trips to the beach along the Great Ocean Road and to Phillip Island, as well as trips to the snow at Lake Mountain. Malins frequently captured road signs of their travel destinations, including Anglesea, Lorne, Wye River and Cowes. Other moments captured include children’s birthday parties, horse riding and children at school (possibly Koonung Heights Primary School in Mont Albert North, 1954–1993).</p>\n<p>The film also features footage of an historic gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance on the occasion of Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery’s visit to Melbourne in 1947.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights (time codes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:02:00  (upside down footage) caged orangutan at Zoo eating an ice cream<br />\n00:00:15:00  entrance to Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:00:20:00  visitor hands food to a white-cheeked gibbon through cage fence<br />\n00:00:29:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John picnic on lawn, with the Taggart family<br />\n00:00:45:00  children ride the open-carriage train, ‘Zoo Spirit of Progress’ written on side of driver’s car (a reference to Victorian Railways premier express train from Melbourne to Albury)<br />\n00:01:07:00  children riding on an Indian Elephant<br />\n00:01:15:00  horse performing tricks for audience, balancing on a see-saw, riding and bucking in the arena with a baboon (possibly a hamadryas baboon) on back<br />\n00:01:40:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John with Mabel Malins (Nana) having a picnic with fire next to river, great shots of family members eating and smiling, at Healesville Sanctuary<br />\n00:02:40:00  Children play in yard.

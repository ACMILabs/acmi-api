There&#8217;s the gold digger (Claire Dodd), the disgruntled ex-wife (Renee Whitney), the secretary with secret artistic abilities (Ruby Keeler), the faithful Girl Friday (Joan Blondell) who stands by the man who doesn&#8217;t know that she loves him, the long suffering personal assistant (Hugh Herbert), and the young protegee (Dick Powell). Numbers created and staged by Busby Berkeley and include hits such as &#8220;Honeymoon hotel&#8221;, &#8220;Shanghai Lil&#8221; and &#8220;By a waterfall&#8221;. This was the third of Warner&#8217;s backstage musicals released in 1933, the other two being &#8220;42nd Street&#8221; and &#8220;The Gold diggers of 1933&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Comedy", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957380, "name": "Lloyd Bacon", "creator_id": 65568, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957379, "name": "Lloyd Bacon", "creator_id": 65568, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957378, "name": "Robert Lord", "creator_id": 23706, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957376, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957382, "name": "Busby Berkeley", "creator_id": 65585, "role": "choreographer", "role_id": 951, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 957381, "name": "Busby Berkeley", "creator_id": 65585, "role": "choreographer", "role_id": 951, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 957377, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18893, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/4mrL1qVnQXjl6NDfhnp1LjGlqis.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Footlight parade (Lloyd Bacon) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 800, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45387", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1933", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1933"}], "labels": [27948]}, {"id": 67705, "acmi_id": "23327", "title": "Foothold on Antarctica", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "foothold-on-antarctica", "creator_credit": "James Carr, British Information Services and World Wide Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1957", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>As a preliminary to the crossing of the Antarctic continent by Sir Vivian Fuchs and his party, an advance group set out from London in the m.v. &#8220;Theron&#8221;, a Canadian sealing vessel, to establish a base camp.

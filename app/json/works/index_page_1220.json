Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold) is a sensitive young poet who naively decides to leave the safety of Oslo and his girlfriend Gertrude (Camilla Martens) to embark on a fur-trapping expedition to Greenland for twelve months. It is the year 1925. On arrival at the east coast of Greenland, Henrik is teamed up with two experienced trappers, the rough and intimidating Randbek (Stellan Skarsgard) and the quieter introspective scientist, Holm (Bjorn Sundquist). Their living quarters for the twelve months is a tiny isolated hut in the bleak icy sparseness of the Greenland wastelands where tension and conflict between the three escalates to unimaginable heights, and man&#8217;s inhumanity to man emerges as more than just a threat. This is an outstanding film by Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland (The Last lieutenant) full of atmosphere and ambience and a stark beauty which underlies the ugliness and volatility smouldering beneath the surface. Stellan Skarsgard (The Unbearable lightness of being, The Hunt for Red October, Breaking the Waves, Simple minded murderer) and Gard B. Eidsvold (The Last lieutenant) each bring to their role a passionate intensity and a chilling reality of the human condition in adverse circumstances.

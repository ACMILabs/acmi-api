Stylishly designed, this series has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book&#8217;s milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert&#8217;s saga than the film version &#8220;Dune&#8221; (Lynch, 1984). Like much science fiction, this futuristic tale has medieval and Biblical overtones with exotic sets, bizarre costumes and stilted dialogue that tends toward the florid and metaphoric. An interesting and engaging series.

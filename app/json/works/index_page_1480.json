The animation of the show is impressive but highlights the difficulties that arise for artists attempting to re-create human expressions. Funny and funky, &#8220;Roughnecks&#8221; is an entertaining series that doesn&#8217;t go anywhere new dramatically but has some witty one-liners and a great sense of the absurd. Cast includes Clancy Brown, Elizabeth Daily, David DeLuise, Bill Fagerbakke, Nicholas Guest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Adaptations&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women soldiers", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Life on other planets", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Pluto (Planet)", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Space ships", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 923934, "name": "Adelaide Productions", "creator_id": 34618, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923935, "name": "Audu Paden", "creator_id": 34619, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923936, "name": "Chris Berkeley", "creator_id": 80066, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923937, "name": "David Hartman", "creator_id": 80067, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923938, "name": "Sam Liu", "creator_id": 80068, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923939, "name": "Jay Oliva", "creator_id": 80069, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923940, "name": "Audu Paden", "creator_id": 34619, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 923933, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50475", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32451], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91139, "acmi_id": "314221", "title": "Rouge [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "rouge-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Golden Harvest, Jackie Chan and Stanley Kwan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Hong Kong, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Fleur, a courtesan in her former life, returns as a ghost to Hong Kong in the 1980s.

Back at headquarters the treachery continues amidst those who seek power and glory. Stylishly designed, this series has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book&#8217;s milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert&#8217;s saga than the film version &#8220;Dune&#8221; (Lynch, 1984).

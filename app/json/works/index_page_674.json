The severity of the disease depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. This excellent and informative documentary presents five women of varying age, who have all experienced the trauma of breast cancer. Each woman relates her own personal story from the initial diagnosis and having to deal with the reality, to surgery and treatment and finally to recovery and the future.

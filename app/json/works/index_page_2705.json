Family, commitment and trust are celebrated in this film, as is tolerance, and political and communal responsibility. The acting of Ascaride and Meylan is first rate, as it is with the excellent supporting cast. Filmed in the proletariat sections of the city, this film is also a loving tribute to the history of struggle in Marseilles. In the age of ironic detachment or extravagant violence, &#8220;Marius and Jeannette&#8221; is a fin-de-siecle film that argues for engagement and for tenderness.

This acerbic and very dark comedy was a controversial disaster for Chaplin on its initial release. He was blacklisted as a &#8220;communist sympathiser&#8221; by the McCarthy-era witch-hunt in Hollywood, and &#8220;Monsieur Verdoux&#8221; was used as evidence against him at his trial. Over the years, however, the film has gained a reputation as one of the most subversive and cynical black comedies to have ever come out of Hollywood. The subject matter - serial murder, misogyny, anti-Capitalism - still has the power to shock an audience. Some of the main delights of this film are the range of excellent comic performances by Chaplin himself, Martha Raye and Isobel Elsom. The film was based on a true to life murder case and the idea for the film was suggested by Orson Welles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Politics and government", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 805159, "name": "Charles Chaplin", "creator_id": 10471, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 805158, "name": "Charles Chaplin Productions", "creator_id": 70612, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47607", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1947", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1947"}], "labels": [29869]}, {"id": 70554, "acmi_id": "26217", "title": "Monsieur Pointu", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "monsieur-pointu", "creator_credit": "Andre Leduc, Bernard Longpre, Rene Jodoin and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1975", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Here is screen magic at its best.

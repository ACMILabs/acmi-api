Ruan (Maggie Cheung) is already an established star at age 20 when her world starts to collapse. First married to an immature, pleasure seeking play boy, she obtains a costly divorce in order to set-up house with Tang Chi Shan (Tony Leung Ka-fai), a producer at Lienhua who is also a married man. Tired of playing melodramatic characters, Ruan accepts a role in film directed by an up and coming director titled &#8216;New Woman&#8217;. The film is a vicious attack of the Chinese press whose tabloid style is pushing a woman to destruction. The press retaliates so violently that massive cuts are ordered to appease the anger of the opinion makers. This is the time Ruan&#8217;s ex-husband re-appears and threatens to expose her as an adulteress. Ruan&#8217;s star starts to spiral down. The film blends fact and fiction, documentary and narrative. Rare footage of the real Ruan&#8217;s performances are mixed with Cheung&#8217;s re-creations of Ruan&#8217;s lost films. In a clever twist of casting, the role of Ruan, originally intended for Anita Mui (Kwan&#8217;s star in &#8216;Rouge&#8217;), went to Maggie Cheung. Cheung was the same age as Ruan at the time of her suicide and had had many run-ins with the Hong Kong press. Kwan blends his narrative with documentary style footage of Cheung explaining how she researched the part and interviews with Chinese cinema veterans. The result is an interrogation on cinema itself.

In what has become a generic convention of the Hong Kong action film, the two develop a sense of empathy and mutual respect as they engage in a series of mind games that become increasingly complicated as the narrative moves towards a final showdown. With its sparse dialogue and moody, cool cinematography, the film is markedly restrained compared to To&#8217;s earlier work. Cast includes Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan.

For others, however, it is both exploitative and directionless. Set in the small Ohio town of Xenia (the Greek for &#8220;outsiders&#8221;), the film abandons traditional narrative to instead portray the lives of unemployed and alienated working-class youth in a series of sometimes surrealistic, sometimes shocking vignettes. If the film has a protagonist, it is young Solomon (Jacob Reynolds), who, along with his older friend Tummler (Nick Sutton), kills cats for pocket-money. This is an American suburbia devastated by poverty and in which teenagers passively drift into drugs, alcohol and sex, with occasional violence being the only excitement. The world of this film is unrelentingly grim: a youth pimps his intellectually disabled girlfriend, boys find their thrills in executing cats, and any fragile sense of community or solidarity is blighted by casual racism and misogyny. However, in depicting the existential reality of the emerging Western underclass, Korine also allows surrealistic moments of beauty to intrude. There is genuine warmth and affection between Solomon and his mother (Linda Manz); there is cameraderie and joy when teenager Dot (Chloe Sevigny) is hanging out with her friends, trading beauty tips, miming to pop songs. Using a mixture of professionals and non-actors, filming in both video and 16mm, not only acknowledging but transforming Godardian experiments with sound and vision to reflect a post-proletariat world, Harmony Korine&#8217;s film is undeniably difficult but also undeniably confronting and exhilarating cinema.

This was Chaplin&#8217;s most personal film in turn nostalgic, melancholic and contemplative as he reflects on old age and the nature of art and comedy. There are only moments of humour (notably in tandem with Buster Keaton). Comedy is a tool for Chaplin&#8217;s larger enterprise of soul-searching and summing up. Cast also includes Claire Bloom and Nigel Bruce.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:16:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Aging", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aging", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Clowns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/limelight-1952", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1971881, "name": "Charles Chaplin", "creator_id": 10471, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971880, "name": "Celebrated Films Corporation", "creator_id": 32105, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971879, "name": "Charles Chaplin", "creator_id": 10471, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47606", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1952", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1952"}], "labels": [29868], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90377, "acmi_id": "313331", "title": "Modern times", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "modern-times", "creator_credit": "Charles Chaplin", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1936", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This was, in effect, the swansong of the Tramp in what is basically a &#8216;silent&#8217; film which makes pointed use of synchronised speech at carefully selected moments.

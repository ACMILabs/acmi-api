Utilising the cinema verite style and a punk soundtrack, he interviews a cross-section of people affected by issues such as unemployment and drugs, and examines the tactics those disenfranchised by societal pressures use to survive. This documentary, shot during Malcolm Fraser&#8217;s reign as Prime Minister, looks at the mundane reality of life for many young people, and aims to persuade viewers to take political action against a system that is seen to oppress individuality and demonise non-conformist behaviour. Filmed around Pyrmont, Kings Cross, and Chippendale.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Cinema verite", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homeless youth - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homelessness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Unemployed - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homeless youth - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hallucinogenic drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Individuality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth", "History&nbsp;→ Demonstrations", "History&nbsp;→ Squatters - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk culture - Australia", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1904953, "name": "Toby Zoates", "creator_id": 33417, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1904952, "name": "Glen Lewis", "creator_id": 33416, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1904951, "name": "AFI [au]", "creator_id": 9711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49671", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Estimated date", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [31732], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92179, "acmi_id": "315396", "title": "[Kodak Cinegraph compilation.

You will be enchanted by this entertaining and much-loved family film that has delighted both young and old for over forty years.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The incredibly multi-talented Danny Kaye stars as Hans Christian Andersen, a young cobbler with a special gift for storytelling. We first see Hans in his home town of Odense, Denmark, entertaining the village children with his fascinating tales - much to the displeasure of the schoolmaster. Hans takes off for Copenhagen where he falls hopelessly in love with a ballerina, only to discover she is already married. However, this unrequited love inspires a spectacular 17 minute ballet, &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221;, that is one of the highlights of the film. Finally Hans returns home to the acclaim of his fellow townsfolk. Nominated for six Academy Awards, it is a visual and musical delight with an imaginative score.

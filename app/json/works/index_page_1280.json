Damon Wayans stars as a successful and affected television executive, Pierre Delacroix, who is pressured by his wannabe home-boy boss (Michael Rapaport) to create a hit series tailored for African Americans. Frustrated by the implicit racism that dominates the entertainment industry, Delacroix comes up with a show that he feels white America really wants to see, a minstrel show called &#8216;Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show&#8217;.

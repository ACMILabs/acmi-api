An oscilloscope records what various sounds look like - the trembling strings of a guitar, the low tones of a tuba, the crow of a rooster and the human speaking voice. Norman McLaren then demonstrates on a moviola the sounds that emit from a soundtrack on which he has drawn dots, lines and triangles and we note how these sounds are synchronised with the artist&#8217;s hand-drawn animations.

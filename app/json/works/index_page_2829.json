Guided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, Frodo is accompanied on his treacherous journey by three hobbit friends, a dwarf, an elf and several humans. This heroic quest invokes all the necessary thrills of an adventure picture, whilst satiating the exacting standards of an audience inured to CGI wizardry, and gratifying legions of zealous Tolkien fans. With ambitious battle scenes and stupendous set pieces, this grand and masterful cinematic spectacle kept most viewers utterly enthralled, whilst earning Jackson almost universal praise for capturing Tolkien&#8217;s mythopoeic narrative and elegiac tone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Greek"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Battles", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 914837, "name": "Wingnut Films", "creator_id": 31880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914838, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914839, "name": "Tim Sanders", "creator_id": 59572, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q22676727", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914840, "name": "Fran Walsh", "creator_id": 72165, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q116861", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914841, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4465", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 914842, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4465", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 914836, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51814", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33464]}, {"id": 95544, "acmi_id": "319714", "title": "The Lorax (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-lorax-tefc", "creator_credit": "Isadore Freleng, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and Hawley Pratt", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47474, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7748410"}], "brief_description": "<p>Presents the story from the book &#8220;The Lorax&#8221; by Dr. Seuss.

A superb cast headed by Steven Waddington, Ciaren Hinds, Susan Lynch, Victoria Smurfit, James Cosmo and Christopher Lee.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["05:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Adventure and adventurers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Knights and knighthood", "History&nbsp;→ Adventure and adventurers", "History&nbsp;→ Crusades", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - Norman Period, 1066-1154", "History&nbsp;→ Knights and knighthood", "History&nbsp;→ Middle Ages", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Mini-series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1819789, "name": "Jeremy Gwilt", "creator_id": 78151, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 791688, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 791689, "name": "A&E Television Networks", "creator_id": 28023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 791691, "name": "Stuart Orme", "creator_id": 24885, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 791687, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42062", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [25487], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93399, "acmi_id": "316827", "title": "Ivan the Terrible: part 2 [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ivan-the-terrible-part-2-dvd", "creator_credit": "Mosfilm, Alma-Ata Studios and Sergei Eisenstein", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Soviet Union, 1945", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1945-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This film is the second part of a trilogy that was not completed.

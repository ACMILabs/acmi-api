And you&#8217;ve got to work hard at it. We used to have a lot of fun, but we never won many games.</p>\n<p>[HORN BLOWING]</p>\n<p>So we turned it around. And that&#8217;s why in the last 20 years we&#8217;ve won premierships. In the &#8216;80s, the cash was $2,000. That was big money. And we could rise up with&#8212; we took raffles and dinner dances and things like that. And then in the &#8216;90s when we were just struggling, we realized we had no money. We have to do something better. And that&#8217;s when we first started wrestling the Harley Davidsons. Four of the committee rang up together and all put in, and we brought a motorbike. And from then on, it was just full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>[MOTOR RUNNING]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: I see our biggest challenge as being fundraising, because we have a pretty clear idea of what we are going to get from a go at the Canteen and the bar. And that&#8217;s enough to cover our expenses. But it&#8217;s not enough to do anything with new buildings. It&#8217;s not enough to repair our fairly basic amenities. We can&#8217;t send players on trips and things like that. We cannot afford to pay our player&#8217;s memberships. We have to ask them to pay, that sort of thing. I&#8217;ve really got to watch all the costs.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>DERRY MONAGHAN: They certainly all pick [INAUDIBLE] stumps. And not for a while they haven&#8217;t, but we did that at [INAUDIBLE] just to try and get a couple of extra players each year. And the local boys here cut wood to source money for the football trip.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>The main source of income is the Vic Grain Bunkers. We have the contract to empty them the [INAUDIBLE] Bunkers. And when we get enough trucks, we can make a lot of money. And that&#8217;s how we source the money to run the club. Now it&#8217;s one in, all in, and from me, down to the players.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: Really, the things that keep small country towns going are your pub, your football team, and your primary school.

We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo. And the rest was history, I suppose.</p>\n<p>[FANS CHEERING]</p>\n<p>[OTHER SIDE BOOING]</p>\n<p>And then if you thought that was erupting over there, well, the display when I was over other side of game was something to behold. I thought I was going to be choked to death, actually. There was that many people all over there. And yeah, pretty exciting stuff.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I guess I played all my junior footy at Waaia. And my dream as a young bloke was always to kick a goal like that after the siren. And to do that for your own town and win a Grand Final&#8212; I mean, just to win a game is normally pretty exciting, but to do it in a Grand Final, every now and then, you relive the moment, and it&#8217;s an amazing feeling. Sort of get a chill up your spine now even still.</p>\n<p>Yeah, but just to&#8212; I suppose to win a Grand Final off your own boot, in that respect, with one kick&#8212; I was just lucky to have that opportunity, I suppose. I feel very grateful for it.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:54:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened.

This is a story of small town trauma and redemption.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Peter Jenkins, Edna Towns, Rita Baker, Gary Squires, and Glen Davie. Archival video and still images reproduced courtesy of Orbost Snowy Rovers Football Club and &#8220;The Snowy River Mail&#8221;.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[INTERPOSING VOICES] PETER JENKINS:  I think from background&#8212; well, the Snowy Rovers have always been very much a working-class team. A lot of the guys worked out in the bush, worked in the mills, you know, that line of work, physical hard, physical work, sort of went and played at the Snowy Rovers, whereas the bank people, the accountants and schoolteachers, all tended to come to the Orbost footy club. And it was pretty full-on rivalry.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS:  Friday nights, I think you would have found that Rovers went up to the top hotel and the Orbost boys went down to the bottom hotel. You probably went to one butcher if he was a member of the Rovers, or a member of the Orbost, say, you went to him.</p>\n<p>But it was really one eyed football, wasn&#8217;t it? But then once football was over, we were all friends again, because we all live in the same town, after all, don&#8217;t we?

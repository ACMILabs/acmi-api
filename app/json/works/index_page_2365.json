The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family.

The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA).

A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas. Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema. From the opening sequence where the camera flies across the island, to a stunning tracking shot of a man navigating his canoe through a village perched on water, to the final rousing march of the revolutionaries descending from the hills, the film is an intoxicating series of marvellous choreographed set pieces. Though Mikhail&#8217;s influences are clearly those of silent cinema, the score and soundtrack to &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is also equally powerful, experimental and emotionally rich. The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA). It is certainly florid and melodramatic but the propaganda is not hard to take - not when it is so sumptuously presented and not when, as the four narrative sequences make abundantly clear, the causes for revolution are ethically and economically justified.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Russian", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cuba", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Capitalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Imperialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Student movements", "Experimental", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Cuba", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Soviet Union", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Castro, Fidel, 1927-", "History&nbsp;→ Cuba - History - Revolution - 1959", "History&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "History&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery", "History&nbsp;→ Student movements", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music, Cuban", "People&nbsp;→ Castro, Fidel, 1927-", "People&nbsp;→ Yevtushenko, Yevgeny Aleksandrovich, 1933-", "Places&nbsp;→ Cuba"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/i-am-cuba", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995750, "name": "Mikhail Kalatozov", "creator_id": 33453, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q324937", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995749, "name": "Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC)", "creator_id": 30221, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995748, "name": "Mosfilm", "creator_id": 4199, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49695", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 199, "name": "Cuba", "slug": "cuba"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [31756]}, {"id": 92265, "acmi_id": "315493", "title": "Jules and Jim = Jules et Jim [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jules-and-jim-jules-et-jim-dvd", "creator_credit": "Francois Truffaut, Marcel Berbert, Les Films du Carrosse and SEDIF", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47020, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q512350"}], "brief_description": "<p>The story of a menage-a-trois in the years around World War I is distanced by the narrator who makes the viewer continually aware of the artifice involved in its telling.

In the early part of the 20th century, Korea was ruled by Japan until the defeat of Japan at the end of WWII in 1945 when Korea split in two - South Korea backed by the United States and North Korea by the Soviet Union. By 1948 tensions between the two Koreas began to esculate. On 25 June 1950 the North Korean Peoples Army crossed the 38th Parallel to launch an offensive against the Republic of Korea (South). Calls for ceasefire were ignored and so began the Korean War (or as it became known in Australia, &#8220;The Forgotten War&#8221;). The United Nations sanctioned action in Korea against the North Korean Army, and Australia, under Prime Minister Robert Menzies, committed forces to the conflict. It took over three years for the Korean War to end - 27 July 1953 - with 74,000 South Korean and United Nations soldiers killed (including 339 Australians) and over a million North Korean and Chinese. Using archival film footage, newsreels, documentaries, stills and interviews, this program presents an historic overview of Australia&#8217;s involvement in the War. Although this role was only a small in comparison to that of the United States, it proved to be an extremely important and valuable contribution. Contains footage of major battles including the Battles of Kapyong and Maryang San fought by the 3rd Battalion, Operation Fauna with the 1st Battalion and The Hook with the 2nd Battalion. Also includes numerous scenes of the Royal Australian Air Force 77 Squadron in action with their Mustangs and Meteors aircraft and the Royal Australian Navy warships, HMAS Shoalhaven, Bataan, Warramunga, and Sydney.

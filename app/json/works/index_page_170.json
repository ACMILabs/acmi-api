Moore questions these theories by focusing on other less violent countries with these same qualities. One of Moore&#8217;s strongest theories is that the scare-mongering prevalent in society, broadcast through the media, and the popularity of reality TV shows, such as &#8220;COPS&#8221;, promotes the notion that danger is omnipresent to the individual and must be countered. Winner of Best Documentary at the 2003 Academy Awards, Moore&#8217;s acceptance speech earned him even greater notoriety when he criticised US President Bush and the war on Iraq.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Social aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in mass media", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in television", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Political satire", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Gun control - United States", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gun control - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Mass media - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political satire", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/bowling-for-columbine", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999622, "name": "Michael Moore", "creator_id": 72776, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999621, "name": "Michael Moore", "creator_id": 72776, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999620, "name": "Kathleen Glynn", "creator_id": 72778, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999619, "name": "Jim Czarnecki", "creator_id": 72777, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999618, "name": "VIF 2", "creator_id": 36634, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999617, "name": "Salter Street Films", "creator_id": 36633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999616, "name": "Dog Eat Dog Films", "creator_id": 36632, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999615, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52559", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34091], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94584, "acmi_id": "318509", "title": "Camila [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "camila-dvd", "creator_credit": "Maria Luisa Bemberg, Lita Stantic, Impala S.A.

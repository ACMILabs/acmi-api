Bob Parish was born on 7 May 1916 and played a long and distinguished part in Victorian and Australian cricket over many years. In particular he was Chairman of the Australian Cricket Board(ACB) from 1975-80 during which time a major development in international cricket took place - that of the creation of World Series Cricket(WSC). The new &#8216;television friendly&#8217; game of WSC could not develop without the assistance of the ACB and it was in negotiating this relationship between the ACB and WSC that Bob Parish played a central role.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2121249, "name": "Daryl Dellora", "creator_id": 6331, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2121256, "name": "David Beesley", "creator_id": 73131, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2121251, "name": "Daryl Dellora", "creator_id": 6331, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewer", "role_id": 457, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "86", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "05 OCT 1999", "notes": "", "to_year": "05 OCT 1999"}], "labels": [47416]}, {"id": 84192, "acmi_id": "305492", "title": "Bob and Bobek. - Volume 1.", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bob-and-bobek-volume-1", "creator_credit": "Special Broadcasting Services", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Czechoslovakia, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Bob and Bobek are two lovable white rabbits who will delight children up to the age of eight years.

It turns out the note was intended from Cao Mimi to Yao Xiaohe – as they had quarrelled earlier – encouraging her to push on.</p>\n<p>The title “Blossoming Years” (豆蔻年华, dou kou nian hua) is derived from the Tang Dynasty’s master poet Du Mu, who compares a girl’s early teen years with the first blossoms of a flower.<br />\nThe significance of this film is toward the complex relationships and strong loyalties that are born for many high school teens, especially those living closely with one another through stressful and emotional periods. The themes approached each mirror important social phenomena of today’s China, and share a specific practical and humanistic perspective. The extreme, almost fanatical, attitudes inspired by the high level of competition for entry to the most prestigious schools are shown when classmates reveal to each other that they plan to commit suicide if they fail to achieve the top marks.<br />\nThis kind of reality, while it may be considered melodramatic by many people’s standards, has in fact scaled down greatly from many of the attitudes exhibited by Chinese students and their parents. This has been especially true for those confined by social standing and provincial regulations to rural areas, as it is typically much more difficult for them to secure work and study opportunities in major cities and educational institutions. This film is recommended as a source material for those referencing the high levels of pressure on students to consistently achieve levels of excellence from very young ages. It is also a keen insight into the psychology that allows such children undergoing such hardship, to develop strong relationships and moral consciences despite such hardships.<br />\nThe film also incorporates some very cutting edge 80s music.<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald;

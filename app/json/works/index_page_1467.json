Lalai was the concubine of a cold-blooded merchant, Yushupu. After giving birth to two twin girls, Lalai was forced to leave the family with only her younger daughter, Ainur. Lalai found her lost young son, Ai Shan (from a previous marriage) in the street but she died soon. Young Ai Shan beg in the street to feed his sister, but Yushupu seized the twin girl back and made her a servant. A few years later, Ai Shan also became a servant of the Yushupu family. By the time Ai Shan and his sister grew up, Xinjiang was liberated by the People’s Liberation Army. Yushupu plans to escape and disguises himself as an old servant in a caravan. Ainur is disguised as a bride and Ai Shan as the majordomo, who are indeed both under the surveillance of Yushupu and his fourth concubine. Reconnaissance platoon leader, Sadikh and Batur are ordered to intercept Yushupu. The two saved the life of Ai Shan and were allowed to stay in the caravan. Yushupu was suspicious of Sadikh and Batur and tried to kill them. However, Sadikh escaped with the help of Ainur. Yushupu killed Ai Shan and wanted to kill Ainur as well as the caravan got closer and closer to the border, where they would meet Ainur’s elder twin sister. Sadikh brought troops and saved Ainur.

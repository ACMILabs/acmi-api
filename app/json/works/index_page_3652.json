The series follows the story of Jess (Charlotte Coleman), a young girl, and her relationships with her adoptive mother - an outrageously fanatical Evangelist; the church - including an equally devout pastor and flock; and the people of her small township in Northern England. In accordance with her mother&#8217;s wishes, Jess is set to train as a missionary. However, when her relationship with local girl, Melanie, is exposed as more than friendship, ensuing tensions propel Jess&#8217; arduous journey of self-discovery on a more difficult and changed trajectory than she had planned. The story of Jess&#8217; hardwon escape from the township is treated with both tragedy and black humour. This series won three BAFTA awards including Best Serial and Best Actress.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television serials - Great Britain", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Christianity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Women authors", "People&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television serials&nbsp;→ Television serials - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 804374, "name": "Beeban Kidron", "creator_id": 67973, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q335605", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1819961, "name": "Phillippa Giles", "creator_id": 31890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 804372, "name": "Second Sight Television", "creator_id": 31889, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47225", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [29527]}, {"id": 71202, "acmi_id": "007962", "title": "Oranges and lemons", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "oranges-and-lemons-a", "creator_credit": "Margot Lethlean and Swinburne Institute of Technology.

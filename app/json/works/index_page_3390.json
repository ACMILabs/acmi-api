All the contingents of the universe call for a war against the Fremen, who are turning themselves into a fierce guerrilla group. Paul&#8217;s mother, Lady Jessica, continues to live among the Freman, having borne a daughter who possesses powers beyond her years. At the palace, Baron Harkonnen and his nephew Rabban battle over the leadership of the planet, whilst the Fremen people sabotage the spice industry, destabilising the Harkonnen rule. Stylishly designed, this series has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book&#8217;s milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert&#8217;s saga than the film version &#8220;Dune&#8221; (Lynch, 1984). Like much science fiction, this futuristic tale has medieval and Biblical overtones with exotic sets, bizarre costumes and stilted dialogue that tends toward the florid and metaphoric. An interesting and engaging series.

Paul and his mother (Francesca Annis) seek refuge in the deserts of the planet Arakis. They join the Fremen who live under the desert sands. Soon the prophecy of a messiah becomes true as Paul leads the Fremen in battle against the forces controlling and manipulating their planet and the precious spice Melange. David Lynch manages to create a sense of the complex dynastical world which Frank Herbert had created in his popular novel, whilst retaining Lynch&#8217;s love for the bizarre and disturbing.

Accidentally separated from his family, Remy coincidentally arrives at the former restaurant of his chef hero, Gusteau, and seizes an opportunity to secretly create a soup that is a menu hit. Discovered and threatened with destruction, Remy teams up with the hapless garbage-boy, Linguini, to create the best food in Paris (and therefore, of course, the best food in the world!). While Linguini takes credit for the culinary art they produce, it is actually Remy exercising creative control (sitting under Linguini&#8217;s chef&#8217;s hat and steering his actions by pulling on his hair). The restaurant&#8217;s resulting wild success attracts the interest of the feared food critic, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O&#8217;Toole), but a mass walkout of kitchen staff on the night Ego visits threatens disaster. It&#8217;s rats to the rescue as Remy&#8217;s family and clan take over the running of the kitchen while Remy creates his masterpiece - ratatouille - for Ego, warming the critic&#8217;s icy heart, and winning a good review for Gusteau&#8217;s in the process. Beautifully drawn animation complements the quality of the witty script, with its highly developed characterisations and thoughtful reflections on cross-cultural prejudice, the role and power of the critic, the commodification of art, and the weight of conflicting loyalties to family and one&#8217;s own dreams. With appeal for both adults and children, and food lovers of all ages, &#8220;Ratatouille&#8221; may be a genuine example of that rarity, a true &#8220;family picture.&#8221; Cast also includes the voices of: Patton Oswalt (as Remy), Ian Holm (as the villainous chef Skinner), Janeane Garofalo (as the tough female chef Colette), and Lou Romano (as Linguini).

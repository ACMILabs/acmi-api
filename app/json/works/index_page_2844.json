In 1985, I graduated with a degree in applied theatre studies from the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad.  Shortly after completing my studies I went into exile in northern Iraq: I was waiting for political change to go back home. After crossing the border from Iraq to Iran, I was arrested, imprisoned and transferred to a detention centre.  I remained there for seven weeks before I was transferred to another detention centre in Tehran. I was there for 11 months.<br />\nIn the detention centre there was the constant threat of being deported back to Iraq. I got a false passport and was travelling to Syria when I was arrested again for having false papers.<br />\nI escaped to the Pakistan-Iran border; I introduced myself to UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) as an Iraqi refugee. I spent - or wasted - seven years of my life waiting for an answer from the UNHCR regarding my application for resettlement.<br />\nI was finally accepted as a refugee by Australia. In 1997, I arrived in Perth. In 2001, I became an Australian citizen. In 2003, I finished my Master of Creative Arts at Newcastle University.<br />\nIn 2004, I want back to see my homeland for the first time after 17 to 18 years in exile, afterwards returning to Australia.<br />\n- Niz Jabour</p>\n<p>Taken from PROOF exhibition 2004</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Audio Format/Stereo"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 936777, "name": "Niz Jabour", "creator_id": 10500, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 936778, "name": "Philippa Knack", "creator_id": 73590, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "10608", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [48930], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95077, "acmi_id": "319122", "title": "Greetings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "greetings-dvd", "creator_credit": "Charles Hirsch, West End Film and Brian De Palma", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A film very representative of the era and place in which it was made - New York late 1960s. &#8220;Greetings&#8221;, directed by Brian De Palma, is about three hip intellectual young men who come up with some novel ideas on how to avoid the draft that will send them to the conflict in Vietnam.

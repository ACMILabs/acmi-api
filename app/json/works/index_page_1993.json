While her husband was still in good favour with the revolutionary army, she was the vice-director of the woman&#8217;s liberation group. As well as losing her husband, all her possessions had been confiscated and she is left to raise her eight year old son, Yang-Yang, in the poor outskirts of the city. The narrative is centred on the relationship between mother and son, who are faced with the hardships and poverty of life in China. Luo Li-Ping, a local postman, develops a close relationship with the mother and son; he quietly supports and takes care of them throughout the years (we see the passage of time through the maturation of Yang-Yang). Ten years later, after the death of Mao, Zhang Wei-Ming&#8217;s name is cleared; it is revealed that he was a victim of the &#8220;Gang of Four&#8221;. With that, Liang-Hui and Yang-Yang&#8217;s former rights and privileges are restored. The pair&#8217;s prosperity and social status convinces Luo that he is no longer needed, so he stays away. His absence is sorely felt by Liang-Hui, the distance makes her realise her love for him. Upon meeting again, each confesses their true feelings for the other, but they know that their love for each other will not be an easy one, many obstacles still lie ahead, for they are from vastly different social classes.

The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This reel shows the family at the New South Wales coastal town of Eden, in 1938.</p>\n<p>Opens with shots of small, masted boats in harbour (at Eden, New South Wales). One of the boats – with four men in it – is moving out of harbour under engine power.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:29:00 a pier, with vehicular rails running along it and a small two-chimneyed ship moored alongside. A small masted vessel is being prepared for launching<br />\n00:00:43:00 close-up of a man striding through the camera&#8217;s field of vision, then the camera pans slowly over the sea and coastal landscape<br />\n00:01:28:00 a bush-fringed road, with a parked car and a man sitting nearby (with back to camera). The camera lingers on the surrounding bush and hills, with the sea visible in the background. This sequence appears to be shot from a vantage point further inland than the earlier coastal scenes<br />\n00:01:57:00 two people are standing at the base of a tall building; the camera pans up the structure to show the &#8216;battlements&#8217; at its top. This is &#8216;Boyd&#8217;s Tower&#8217;, a 23 metre structure built in 1847 by the ex-Scottish entrepreneur Ben Boyd, intended as a lighthouse, but never commissioned.<br />\n00:02:20:00 entire tower photographed from a slight distance; the full structure can be seen above the surrounding bush<br />\n00:02:37:00 same man who appeared earlier in the footage and a woman wearing riding jodhpurs are standing on a rise overlooking the water as the camera pans past them across the scene of bush and sea<br />\n00:03:06:00 same man and woman – accompanied by an older woman – are strolling through a park or garden above the coast, looking away from the camera. A dog is frolicking around them, and a horse is grazing nearby.<br />\n00:03:24:0 same man walking along a rise, looking away from the camera at the sea and headlands below him. The camera tracks him as he walks further away from it, looking back over his shoulder occasionally.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

"<p>George William Malins (1910–2007) was an amateur filmmaker who made home movies in Australia and overseas from the 1940s to 1970s. According to his daughter, George was ‘optimistic, happy and enthusiastic’, an outlook reflected in his films which are a history of home life and a love of travel.</p>\n<p>George came to Australia from England as a young man by way of the merchant navy, after having seen South America and some of Asia. He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows the Malins family in a montage of holidays and events in Victoria spanning several years from 1946 to the 1950s (not in precise chronological order). Highlights include a visit to Melbourne Zoo, trips to the beach along the Great Ocean Road and to Phillip Island, as well as trips to the snow at Lake Mountain. Malins frequently captured road signs of their travel destinations, including Anglesea, Lorne, Wye River and Cowes. Other moments captured include children’s birthday parties, horse riding and children at school (possibly Koonung Heights Primary School in Mont Albert North, 1954–1993).</p>\n<p>The film also features footage of an historic gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance on the occasion of Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery’s visit to Melbourne in 1947.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights (time codes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:02:00  (upside down footage) caged orangutan at Zoo eating an ice cream<br />\n00:00:15:00  entrance to Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:00:20:00  visitor hands food to a white-cheeked gibbon through cage fence<br />\n00:00:29:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John picnic on lawn, with the Taggart family<br />\n00:00:45:00  children ride the open-carriage train, ‘Zoo Spirit of Progress’ written on side of driver’s car (a reference to Victorian Railways premier express train from Melbourne to Albury)<br />\n00:01:07:00  children riding on an Indian Elephant<br />\n00:01:15:00  horse performing tricks for audience, balancing on a see-saw, riding and bucking in the arena with a baboon (possibly a hamadryas baboon) on back<br />\n00:01:40:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John with Mabel Malins (Nana) having a picnic with fire next to river, great shots of family members eating and smiling, at Healesville Sanctuary<br />\n00:02:40:00  Children play in yard.

According to his daughter, George was ‘optimistic, happy and enthusiastic’, an outlook reflected in his films which are a history of home life and a love of travel.</p>\n<p>George came to Australia from England as a young man by way of the merchant navy, after having seen South America and some of Asia. He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows the Malins family in a montage of holidays and events in Victoria spanning several years from 1946 to the 1950s (not in precise chronological order). Highlights include a visit to Melbourne Zoo, trips to the beach along the Great Ocean Road and to Phillip Island, as well as trips to the snow at Lake Mountain. Malins frequently captured road signs of their travel destinations, including Anglesea, Lorne, Wye River and Cowes. Other moments captured include children’s birthday parties, horse riding and children at school (possibly Koonung Heights Primary School in Mont Albert North, 1954–1993).</p>\n<p>The film also features footage of an historic gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance on the occasion of Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery’s visit to Melbourne in 1947.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights (time codes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:02:00  (upside down footage) caged orangutan at Zoo eating an ice cream<br />\n00:00:15:00  entrance to Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:00:20:00  visitor hands food to a white-cheeked gibbon through cage fence<br />\n00:00:29:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John picnic on lawn, with the Taggart family<br />\n00:00:45:00  children ride the open-carriage train, ‘Zoo Spirit of Progress’ written on side of driver’s car (a reference to Victorian Railways premier express train from Melbourne to Albury)<br />\n00:01:07:00  children riding on an Indian Elephant<br />\n00:01:15:00  horse performing tricks for audience, balancing on a see-saw, riding and bucking in the arena with a baboon (possibly a hamadryas baboon) on back<br />\n00:01:40:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John with Mabel Malins (Nana) having a picnic with fire next to river, great shots of family members eating and smiling, at Healesville Sanctuary<br />\n00:02:40:00  Children play in yard.

On the way he is joined by school friends and we see their encounters with a variety of native Australian Wildlife.  They see lace monitor tracks and follow them to where the monitor is scaling a tree. They also find a possum and an echidna.  The film shows various closeups of the animals and the children’s faces as they squint and shield their eyes from the sun.</p>\n<p>The children cross a wooden bridge where they meet an old man carrying a swag and a billy. The man gathers the children around him and reads a story to them called “The Bear”. The film then shows us the story as it is being told. It is a tale of a young girl who is very poor, very dirty and very sad. One day she finds a toy koala which brings her great joy. Excitedly she tries to show her Koala to other school children who are playing games in the school yard. They ridicule her and throw sticks at her. She runs away and falls on the grass where she drifts off to sleep. She dreams that she is rescued by a fairy Godmother who transforms her into a very clean girl in a beautiful dress! During this sequence we see good examples of Super 8 “special effects” as the fairy works her magic on the other children, transforming them into characters in fancy dress. We see these children playing circle games and closeups of their faces. Eventually the poor girl wakes up to find a kind school boy standing over her.  He helps her to her feet, takes her hand and leads her to join his other friends. Together the group skip happily all the way to school along a country road.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of children’s fashion, games and faces.

Along the way, Zhan antagonises the boy, who becomes increasingly distressed. Discovering a photo of his father in his pocket, Zhan calls the soldier insignificant. Upset and defensive, the boy declares that his father was a Rank 23 Cadre who served in Xingjiang. Chen, the director, befriends the boy, listening intently as he shares stories of the brave soldier.

When they return to the car after the meeting, they find that Wao Xiaobing has escaped, apparently driven away by Zhan&#8217;s ill-tempered threats. While Chen and his manager worry about the safety of the boy, Zhan maintains his anger. They search the city for him, and learn from a gathered crowd that a young boy fitting Wao Xiaobing’s description has been hit by a car. Panicking, the men run to the nearest hospital to find him, but are not allowed into the operating theatre. Disguising themselves as doctors, they sneak in and encounter a number of doctors working furiously on the boy. The child, however, is not Wao Xiaobing. Relieved, the men frantically continue their search, having formed a bond with the boy. When they return to the car, they find Wao Xiaobing asleep next to it.

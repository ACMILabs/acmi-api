The reality is that Bobby is single, but his investment in new wheels brings with it the potential for real sexual experience. The van in question is a souped up vehicle complete with waterbed, plush interior and mirrors on the ceiling. Bobby&#8217;s investment in the van is threatened when a friend in trouble desperately needs his car loan repayment money. Simultaneously Bobby falls for a local girl, who challenges Bobby&#8217;s desire to sleep with a bevy of women. This film often skips into dream mode, whence the audience witnesses the sexual fantasy of various characters as they gaze upon a particular scene or person. This film is in part a curio from the 1970s that documents a car culture fetish and a male desire to assuage ego with sexual experiences.

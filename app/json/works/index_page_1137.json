The picture they paint is bleak; a town divided along racial and age lines, where whites and Aborigines are mutually suspicious of each other, where parents and grandparents can no longer understand the choices their children are making when it comes to sex, drugs and work. Filmed over the approaching Christmas period, &#8220;Cunnamulla&#8221; has its fair share of eccentric and stoic human beings, but the overriding impression is that the rapid pace of globalisation is exacerbating conflict and leading to the death of the very town itself.

There are good examples of Melbourne architecture, fashion and Australian cars, reflective of the time.</p>\n<p>The film begins with scenes on board a cruise ship. We see dolphins swimming alongside the ship as Maurie and his son share an affectionate moment on the deck. Val finds her sea legs and relaxes on a sun lounge or deck chair. Passengers enjoy diving into and swimming in the cruise ship’s swimming pool.</p>\n<p>Back on dry land, a street scene shows a boy (possibly Maurie’s son) riding along the footpath on a Dragster bicycle. Parked along the side of the road we see great examples of cars c1960s. We see an Australian Ford Fairlaine, an Australian Ford Falcon, an FC Holden Station Wagon and possibly an FE Holden. There is also a HK Holden Belmont or Kingswood c1968, and a Vauxhall. The family cat and dog also make a brief appearance.</p>\n<p>The film shows guests arriving to a wedding ceremony being held at the Royal Mint in Melbourne. The Mint was opened in 1872 and became a Registry of Civil Marriages in the 1970s.

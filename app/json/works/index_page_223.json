The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America.

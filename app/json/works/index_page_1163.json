The film was filmed with two endings. At the first release, the tragic ending chosen by Duvivier was a total flop. After 6 weeks, the film was withdrawn and re-released with a happy ending version. A very beautiful film which will be remembered as one of Duvivier&#8217;s finest. It is sensitive without sentimentality, original without effort, populist without vulgarity ; it starts with gaiety and we all feel gay. It ends tragically and our hearts rend. Simple people for a simple story, but with an added dimension of deep tragic poetry, for it shows how destiny can change and look like luck at first, then become fatality.&#8221; Source: L&#8217;Avant-Scene du Cinema, March 1996.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Arys Nissotti ; director, Julien Duvivier ; writer, Julien Duvivier, Charles Spaak ; photography, Jules Kruger, Marc Fossard ; music, Maurice Yvain ; art direction, Jacques Krauss.<br />\nCast: Jean Gabin, Charles Vanel, Raymond Aimos, Charles Dorat, Viviane Romance, Raphael Medina, Fernand Charpin, Raymond Cordy, Charles Granval.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816131, "name": "Arys Nissotti", "creator_id": 83031, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357694", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890448, "name": "Julien Duvivier", "creator_id": 23727, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q453683", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146656", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1936", "notes": "", "to_year": "1936"}], "labels": [55430]}]}

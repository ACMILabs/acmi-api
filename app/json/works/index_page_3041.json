The film describes some of the planning and construction of the 500KV line - designed to carry power from the future generating stations of the Latrobe Valley to the local centre in Melbourne. Shows rolling out and cutting of the power cabling, installation of equipment at Hazelwood Plant, preparation and countdown for energizing in June, 1970. Photography by Jim Hayes. &#8220;Along the power lines&#8221; (1962): dramatised account of the work of the mobile repair units of the SEC. Shows film of the irrigation reservoir at Eildon and pipelines at Kiewa, power lines crossing the Murray River Valley joining New South Wales with Victoria and the various parts involved in the process of electricity production from brown coal. Footage of the power plants and lines shows inside the control centre near Melbourne, with the technicians at work monitoring the load on supply.

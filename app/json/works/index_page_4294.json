Originally born Andrew Warhola to immigrant Slovakian parents, this tale starts with a history of his family life in Pittsburgh and travails his life&#8217;s work up to his death in 1987. Not unlike his films, the vision lingers on the exteriors of buildings, the beauty of the everyday through signs and architecture set against a moving sky. The facts are rendered easily to memory as the images are beautiful to watch and the narration by Julian Rhind-Tutt engaging.

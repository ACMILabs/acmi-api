Governor of G Ward is Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib), a boss with a conscience unafraid of standing up for the rights of the prisoners. The core group of women comprise of: Shell (Debra Stephenson), a lifer and the toughest woman on the ward, Denny (Alicia Eyo), Shell&#8217;s faithful sidekick and occasional lover, Nikki (Mandana Jones) a thinking lesbian who isn&#8217;t afraid to speak her mind and has unresolved sexual tension with the Governor, and the Julies, 2 women called Julie fond of finishing one another&#8217;s sentences. An engrossing mix of violence inflicted by women towards women and the inadequacies of the prison system, it also attempts to capture the vagary of relationships and emotions experienced by women who share confined quarters and are without civil liberties. Devised by Maureen Chadwick, Eileen Gallagher and Ann McManus, this award winning series is now in its 5th season. Season two saw the arrival of Karen Betts (Claire King) and Barbara Hunt (Isabelle Amyes), and more high profile stories for Yvonne Atkins, Crystal and Zandra.

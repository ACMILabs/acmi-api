Their main adrenalin hit is violence, with a good dose of alcohol, and Stuttgart is where the action will take place - a chance to take on the Germans, or anyone else who gets in their way. Knives, sledgehammers and baseball bats are their weapons. Extremely graphic and containing some disturbing images, &#8220;The Firm&#8221; caused huge controversy when it was aired in 1989.

In &#8220;The Firm&#8221; we see the nastier violent side of soccer and soccer gangs. Bex Bissek (Gary Oldman) is a respectable estate agent during the week who loves his wife and son but when the weekend arrives, he loves nothing better than to get together with his &#8220;firm&#8221; and give someone a good kicking. His &#8220;firm&#8221; is a gang of football supporters known as the Inter-City Crew, of which Bex is the leader. Bex&#8217;s plan is to unite all the rival gangs into one &#8220;firm&#8221; for the forthcoming European Cup in Germany (1988). These gangs are not just your average football supporters, they are fully organised and come from a broad spectrum of socio-economic backgrounds and culture. Their main adrenalin hit is violence, with a good dose of alcohol, and Stuttgart is where the action will take place - a chance to take on the Germans, or anyone else who gets in their way. Knives, sledgehammers and baseball bats are their weapons. Extremely graphic and containing some disturbing images, &#8220;The Firm&#8221; caused huge controversy when it was aired in 1989. Cast also includes Lesley Manville, Philip Davis, Andrew Wilde, Charles Lawson, Jay Simpson. Screenplay written by Al Hunter.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Director Alan Clarke (Scum, Rita, Sue and Bob too, Christine) brings to the television screen a film of brutal reality, both in physicality and characterisation.

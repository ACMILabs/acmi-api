His chameleon changes of self in order to survive undermine both radical and humanist notions of the &#8220;hero&#8221; and the film asks unsettling and difficult questions about complicity and collaboration in violence. This film is alive: one moment we are laughing out loud at Solomon&#8217;s attempts to hide his penis from view (and its telling lack of foreskin) and in the next moment we confront the stark inhuman obscenity of the Warsaw Ghetto.

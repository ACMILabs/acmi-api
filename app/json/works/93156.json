It is a film that returns to the director&#8217;s favourite theme of interconnectedness within an apparently haphazard world. Irene Jacob is fashion model Valentine whose life takes a seemingly random turn when she runs over a dog. She returns the injured animal to its indifferent owner, a world-weary judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who likes to listen in on neighbours phone conversations. Through this chance encounter, Kieslowski explores the impossibilities of justice as the judge re-examines old verdicts and tries to create order in other people&#8217;s messes. A parallel story-line involves a young man training to be a judge and his unfaithful girlfriend. As the stories unfold, it becomes increasingly evident they are linked on a far deeper level. This elaborate coda, in which life is seen as a set of pre-ordained events and consequences, culminates in a devastating denouement in which all previous characters from the trilogy are ironically united in tragedy in a truly haunting end to the director&#8217;s oeuvre.

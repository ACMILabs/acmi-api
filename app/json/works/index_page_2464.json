This bio-pic, directed by Karim Ainouz, is an exciting and gritty presentation of a paradoxical personality; he lays bare the realities and squalor of poverty whilst bringing all the glamour of performance art to the screen. The central performance by Lazaro Ramos, is compelling and convincing, bringing Joao&#8217;s vitality, flamboyance and commanding presence to life. Cast also includes: Marcelia Cartaxo, Flavio Bauraqui, Felippe Marques and Emiliano Querioz.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Portuguese", "Portuguese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Brazil", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Poverty", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Brazil", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "Places&nbsp;→ Brazil", "Places&nbsp;→ Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930170, "name": "Karim Ainouz", "creator_id": 81168, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930169, "name": "Walter Salles", "creator_id": 32959, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930168, "name": "Juliette Renaud", "creator_id": 81172, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930167, "name": "Donald Ranvaud", "creator_id": 32421, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930166, "name": "Mauricio Andrade Ramos", "creator_id": 81046, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930165, "name": "Vincent Marava", "creator_id": 81171, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930164, "name": "Isabel Diegues", "creator_id": 81170, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930163, "name": "Marc Beauchamps", "creator_id": 81169, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930162, "name": "Karim Ainouz", "creator_id": 81168, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930161, "name": "Lumière", "creator_id": 55220, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930160, "name": "Wild Bunch", "creator_id": 43675, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930159, "name": "Video Filmes", "creator_id": 37233, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930158, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53147", "production_places": [{"id": 209, "name": "Brazil", "slug": "brazil"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34591]}, {"id": 90542, "acmi_id": "313513", "title": "Madame de..", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "madame-de", "creator_credit": "Max Ophuls, Rizzoli Film, Indusfilms and Franco London Film (Paris)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1953", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1953-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Ophuls was attracted to this story of an adulterous affair by its construction around a pair of earrings which pass from hand to hand on a kind of ironic roundabout.

Butterfly (Pinkerton&#8217;s name for Cio-Cio-San), blinded by passion marries Pinkerton, against her family&#8217;s wishes. However, Pinkerton&#8217;s intentions turn out to be not so honourable, returning to America without Butterfly, but promising he will be back soon. Butterfly is left heart-broken but always hopeful of his return. Three long years pass by before Pinkerton, after learning that Butterfly had given birth to a son fathered by him just before his return to America, decides to make the trip back to Japan. Only this time he has a wife in tow and the sole intention of taking his child back to America leaving Butterfly entirely alone. What follows is a most tragic and heart-breaking climax. Seeing opera presented in film as opposed to on stage has quite a powerful effect. Film through its cinematography (Phillipe Welt) opens up the boundaries of scope of outside landscapes and lush settings enhancing the period of costume, culture, mood and the beautiful music of Puccini and allowing a natural flow to the story.

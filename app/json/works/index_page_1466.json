When New Zealand film director Peter Jackson stumbles upon an old trunk of nitrate films in a backyard shed, it appears that he has uncovered a lost chapter in New Zealand film history. His discovery leads him to Colin McKenzie, an extraordinary New Zealand born film pioneer and avid inventor from the early 1900s. Jackson&#8217;s research reveals that McKenzie was responsible for developing many cinematic innovations including colour film, sync sound and tracking shots that had long been attributed to more famous motion picture pioneers. McKenzie also risked his life to make a silent biblical epic &#8216;Salome&#8217; in remote bush on the West Coast of the South Island.

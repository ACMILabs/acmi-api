By stripping the science- fiction genre of all its trappings of hardware and effects, Tarkovsky has created an ascetic masterwork of hypnotic imagery and meditative mise-en-scene. In &#8220;Stalker&#8221; we confront the mystery and agony of humankind&#8217;s spiritual isolation. Trapped within a decaying, materialistic world only the Stalker&#8217;s hoped for redemption through faith can counter the Professor&#8217;s and the Writer&#8217;s metaphysical pessimism. Made at a time when the director was engaged in a hostile battle of wills with the Soviet state, &#8220;Stalker&#8221; is an allegory of spiritual struggle, and it is a richly transcendental work of cinema. Based on the book &#8220;Roadside Picnic&#8221; by Arcady and Boris Strugatsky.

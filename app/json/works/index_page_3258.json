Originally begun as a documentary of their American tour, &#8216;Gimme Shelter&#8217; turned into something quite different when at the end of the tour the Stones organised a free concert at Altamont in California. Hundreds of thousands of young people on hallucinogenic drugs turned up, the local Hell&#8217;s Angels were hired as bouncers and security, and before the end of the night, four people were dead, including a young black teenager whose murder by the Hell&#8217;s Angels is horrifically caught on film. In hindsight, the Altamont free concert came to be seen as the death of &#8220;the summer of love&#8221;, that innocent time in popular culture where it was believed that rock music, drugs, and youth culture would usher in a new age of peace and non-violence in American culture.

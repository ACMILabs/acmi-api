The story centres on a trio of sisters who live in contemporary Hanoi and whose closeness reflects the sanctity of the family. The duration of the story is one month and is framed by the celebration of their mother and father&#8217;s death anniversaries respectively. Beneath the surface of familial tranquillity and calmness, however, lies a sea of anxiety and instability. The elder sister is married to a husband who harbours a shocking secret; the middle sister questions her husband&#8217;s loyalty just as they are beginning a family; and the youngest sister, a strong and idealistic woman, experiences unrequited love whilst having a strong affinity for her brother that is only shades away from being a true relationship.

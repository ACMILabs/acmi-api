At the centre of the film are siblings Stacy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Brad (Judge Reinhold), Stacy is quickly learning about men and sex while Brad lusts after her best friend and gloats about his career prospects. Supporting characters include theatre usher Rat (Brian Backer) who has a crush on Stacy, and Rat&#8217;s friend Mike Damone (Robert Romanus) - a smooth talking sleaze.

Though Altman seamlessly weaves elements of noir, screwball comedy and the crime genre, it is his love of jazz music that informs this film.

Kansas City was one of the leading jazz centres in the United States of America and this film is an homage to that history.

Looking down over Sun Valley and a very long tow queue.</p>\n<p>In a suburban backyard seemingly far from the snow fields, the film shows two children playing in a dry-docked Fireball sailing boat. We see the young boy strapped into the boat’s flying trapeze harness as he swings from the edge of the boat. The children play with a toy ambulance and ride down the street (Cleeve Court) on their bicycles.

The children play on the deck, reading the book “Nursery Rhyme and Pastime Book” and what appears to be a selection of Little Golden Books. A young girl knits while sitting beside her siblings and two people prepare to ski beside the lodge wearing snow gear typical to the era.</p>\n<p>The second Part of the film is titled &#8220;NEDSA 1964”. The acronym stands for North-Eastern District Ski Association which was formed by ski clubs at Falls Creek and Hotham in 1937. Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era.

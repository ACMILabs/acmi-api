When she seeks professional help, a team of psychiatrists study Carla&#8217;s situation seeking to unravel the source of her terror. Some sceptics in the team believe it to be female hysteria even insanity, but one kindly doctor, Phil Schneidermann (Ron Silver) is convinced of her sincerity and is determined to aid her plight with science and a parapsychological approach. At times genuinely terrifying, this film is somewhat dated, particularly in the special effects department, but interestingly was released just a year before Spielberg&#8217;s hugely successful &#8220;Poltergeist&#8221;, with which it shares many major themes. Hershey puts in a fine performance as an imperilled woman whose ordinary (if bleak) life is put under siege by forces beyond her comprehension. Although the film takes a somewhat dissatisfying turn mid-way through, it remains an interesting example of a science versus spirit movie and should prove a boon to horror buffs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hallucinations and illusions", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology - Research", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Demoniac possession", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientists"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-entity", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1975561, "name": "Sidney J.

Lola (Dietrich) is an exotic singer and dancer in a nightclub, enthralling men nightly with her erotic routines. A straight laced and humourless professor (Emil Jannings) at a local school attends the club one evening in the hope of catching some of his errant students there. Lola, who beguiles him with her charms, immediately ensnares the Professor. The unlikely two form a romantic entanglement despite Lola&#8217;s offhand manner towards him. What follows is a tragic story of an ill-begotten match. Dietrich made her name with this film with her inimitable style, establishing her signature tune - &#8220;Falling in love again&#8221;. The tone of the film reflects the depressed state that Germany was in at that time - still suffering the after effects of World War One reparations. Sternberg displays his flair for visual expressiveness and moody atmosphere that he would continue to nurture throughout his career.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Seduction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ German literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-blue-angel", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1975540, "name": "Josef von Sternberg", "creator_id": 85684, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975539, "name": "Erich Pommer", "creator_id": 810, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975538, "name": "Universum Film", "creator_id": 35421, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1975537, "name": "Force Video", "creator_id": 77898, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51206", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1930", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1930"}], "labels": [33092], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93588, "acmi_id": "317098", "title": "The Shootist [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-shootist-dvd", "creator_credit": "Don Siegel, William Self, M Frankovich and De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1976", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in 1901, John Wayne plays John Bernard Books - an ornery, aging gunfighter who returns to his old hometown, where his presence is unwanted and his way of life deemed obsolete.

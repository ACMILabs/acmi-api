Like Friedrich’s subject, the trials rider is ‘wedged between two time signatures – the slow geological signature of the rocks and the furious swell of the ocean’, as Gladwell describes it. As the rider reaches the top of the rocks he rests, putting his feet to the ground, and takes in the view of the ocean from a vantage point he has worked hard to achieve. Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Gladwell’s rider is insignificant within a landscape while striving for mastery over it.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell<br />\nDual-channel video installation<br />\nACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Durations", "display_values": ["00:11:48:00", "00:12:33:00"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["1816235 kbytes (1774mbytes)", "1903367 kbytes (1859mbytes)"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["2 channel video, projection, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1332210, "name": "Shaun Gladwell", "creator_id": 9260, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1332219, "name": "Josh Raymond", "creator_id": 73576, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "photographer", "role_id": 440, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332218, "name": "Gotaro Uematsu", "creator_id": 73575, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332217, "name": "Charles Ko Hsu", "creator_id": 81809, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332216, "name": "Sophie Holvast", "creator_id": 81808, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332215, "name": "Tim Gargano", "creator_id": 81807, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332214, "name": "Jason Consunji", "creator_id": 81806, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332213, "name": "Rian Arnold", "creator_id": 81805, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332212, "name": "Damien Gillings", "creator_id": 81804, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1332211, "name": "Simon Betteridge", "creator_id": 81803, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "158435", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2011", "notes": "", "to_year": "2011"}], "labels": [46818]}, {"id": 107326, "acmi_id": "Z000086", "title": "Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sagittarius-domain-prelude", "creator_credit": "Shaun Gladwell", "credit_line": "<p>Shaun Gladwell<br />\nDual-channel video installation<br />\nACMI Collection</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2011", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "2 channel video, projection, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2011-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>&#8220;Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude&#8221; is a dual-channel video installation commissioned for the exhibition &#8220;Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences&#8221; in 2011.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude&#8221; sits in an enclosed room, two screens facing each other on opposite walls.

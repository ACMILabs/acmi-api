Whimsical, weird, funny, sometimes dark, but with a fabulous music score by George Kleinsinger supported by the Fine Arts Hollywood Orchestra conducted by George Kleinsinger, the film is more directed at the older child or teenage/adult level. The voice characterisations are simply superb, and the support cast, which includes Hal Smith, Joan Gerber, Ken Sansom, Sel Delano and the Jackie Ward singers as the alley cats, are terrific. Also features Byron Kane as the narrator.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Cats - Fiction", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2297085, "name": "John Wilson", "creator_id": 74762, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2297081, "name": "Preston M.

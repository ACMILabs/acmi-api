Resistors to authoritarian rule became international heroes and youth across the world became involved in draft resistance to the Vietnam War. It was the start of a decade of student activism across Britain, Europe and America concerning issues such as the environment, women&#8217;s rights and gay liberation. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1970: half the people&#8221;; women achieve a sense of purpose as they fill the roles of men who have left to fight, roles which do not seem destined to continue as the men return. A post-war generation of women take up the fight for equality and recall the battle for equal pay and opportunities and the sexual freedom obtained with the development of the new birth control pill. The situation would not be the same for women in third world countries such as Asia and Africa.

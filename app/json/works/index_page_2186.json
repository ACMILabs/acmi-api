The aftermath of WW II influenced the direction of theatre and allowed a whole new generation of playwrights the freedom to express their anger, their political allegiance, social realism and an attitude that you could do or say what you want on stage - theatre became the instrument of social change.

series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. In this program we travel back to Britain to a time when British theatre entertained in a fanciful, somewhat straight-laced puritanical manner, appealing to the middle and upper classes through wit and satire. A time during the 1920s and 1930s between the two wars when the audience did not want to be faced with reality and socio-political themes. However, playwrights Noel Coward and Terence Rattigan, through the Royal Court and Comedy Theatres (which were turned into clubs in order to present plays that were banned by the Official Censor, usually for their sexual connotations - homosexuality was considered a &#8220;dirty&#8221; word in those days), entertained and delighted audiences in the West End with plays such as &#8220;The Vortex&#8221;, &#8220;Private lives&#8221; (Coward) and &#8220;The Deep blue sea&#8221; and &#8220;Separate tables&#8221; (Rattigan). Rattigan&#8217;s plays characteristically expressed repressed emotions and hidden sexual desires smouldering beneath the surface whereas Coward was more out there, hamming it up in such a decadent way as to tease but not shock or disgust his audience. In contrast, following WWII the likes of Rodney Ackland (&#8220;The Pink room&#8221; 1952), John Osborne (&#8220;Look back in anger&#8221; 1956), Brendan Behan (&#8220;The Quare fellow&#8221; 1956) and Shelagh Delaney (&#8220;A Taste of honey&#8221; 1958) delivered reality and working class attitudes, sexuality and politics in raw and often confronting language taking British theatre in the 1950s on a revolutionary course. John Osborne, known as the &#8220;angry young man&#8221;, sparked off a whole generation of &#8220;angry young men&#8221; and a slew of social realist productions but it was the foresight and collaboration of people such as George Devine (Royal Court Theatre manager/producer) and Joan Littlewood (founder of the Theatre Workshop) who guided, supported and propelled the young British playwrights into the limelight and their plays on to the stage. Features excerpts and interviews with actors, playwrights, directors including Alan Bates, John Osborne, Arthur Miller, Peter Hall, Noel Coward, Harold Pinter, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud, Rodney Ackland, Joan Littlewood, Brendan Behan, Tom Stoppard and others.

"<p>Episode number 6 of Series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;.<br />\nFinal episode in the outstanding six-part series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. During the last century, theatre was challenged by mass entertainment in the form of cinema, television and the internet. The one thing that has made theatre stand apart is its quality of being &#8220;live&#8221;, allowing an immediate interaction between actors and audience. In this program, Richard Eyre explores how theatre has survived and why it will continue to survive - from the influences of Antonin Artaud&#8217;s &#8220;theatre of cruelty&#8221;, to the commercial popular culture of the blockbuster musicals, to the experimental and avant-garde. He takes us into the 1980s and 90s through discussion, interviews and excerpts, analysing the commercialisation of theatre; the audience; the fusion of traditional theatre with multimedia technology such as robotics, puppetry and film; the construction and reconstruction of theatres, eg the National Theatre, the Olivier Theatre and the Globe Theatre. Eyre argues &#8220;that in order to survive, theatre must be more intense and more powerful than ordinary life&#8221;. Through interviews with playwrights, directors and actors including Robert Lepage (Needles and opium, 1993, Elsinore, 1997), Peter Brook (Marat Sade, 1966, In the act), Trevor Nunn (Les Miserables), Tony Kushner (Angels in America, 1993), Julie Taymor (The Lion king), Hal Prince, Stephen Daldry, Steven Berkoff, Deborah Warner, Tom Stoppard, and others, the question of where the stage of tomorrow is headed is discussed and debated. The series as a whole is informative, passionate, entertaining and beautifully presented, not only in defining theatre and its role in society, but also in providing an historical and critical appraisal of live drama in the 20th century with a particular emphasis on British theatre.

We see images of the pier with people boarding the small boats and preparing for the fishing trip. Once they set sail, we see seals on the rocks and dolphins swimming alongside the boat. The fishing expedition is a great success. A 250lb marlin is caught and brought on board. The catch of the day is taken back to the pier and admired by impressed onlookers. It is weighed, hung from a wooden scaffold, and put on public display. The flank of the fish is tattooed with the name of the fisherman, (R. Michaels), the marlin’s weight and the date of the catch – 6 February 1938. Various locals stop by and pose with the fish to have their photos taken.

Images of the architecture, temples, cultural traditions and ceremonies are also a highlight. The film shows pottery techniques and a pottery ware market. There is footage of a funeral procession and a traditional Balinese temple festival or Odalan. The film shows elaborate offerings of fruit and food which is brought with great ceremony by the locals to the temple. We see Borobudur and surrounds, including details of the temple walls and structure.

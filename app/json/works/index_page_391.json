The home movies provide an insight into the everyday lives of John and his family in Victoria, including picnics, trips to the Grampians and Colac, family snapshots and aeroplanes of the late 1920s.</p>\n<p>John Robertson Duigan (1882–1951) was an early aviator and engineer. With the assistance of his brother Reginald Duigan, John built the first Australian-made aircraft to successfully fly, in 1910 at their family’s sheep station, Spring Plains, in Mia Mia, Victoria. Inspired by a postcard sent from a friend in London featuring a photo of Wilbur Wright flying his Model A aeroplane, John successfully built, tested and flew his own biplane and was one of the pioneering aviators in Australia who paved the way for the adventurous pilots of the 1920s. In 1920, John donated his original biplane to the Industrial and Technological Museum in Melbourne (now Museums Victoria). John and Reginald were commemorated as ‘pioneer aviators’ on a 6 cent stamp issued by Australia Post in 1970.</p>\n<p>This collection was donated to ACMI by Martin Hudson.</p>"],

He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>Note, the documentary ‘How I Filmed the War’ which is included in the collection was made by George’s uncle and official war photographer Geoffrey Malins. Geoffrey was awarded an OBE (Order of the British Empire) for his work in filming the ‘Battle of the Somme’.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter, Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films",

1940s to 1970s.

He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter Ruth Hargrave.

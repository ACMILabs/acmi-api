Fields and is a silent romantic comedy directed by the great D.W. Griffith. The drama starts in a circus during the Twenties and introduces the story of an orphan Sally (Carol Dempster) and her loveable, juggler, circus performing carer Prof. Eustace P. McGarcle (Fields). Sally is initially unaware that McGargle is not her real father who, through the course of events, decides to reunite her with her grandparents. They make a comedic journey to the town of her grandparents where a wealthy man falls for the circus girl and the drama unfolds. It is a story of mistaken identity, romance and family reunions. The film is known more for being W.C. Fields first screen appearance than one of D.W. Griffith&#8217;s greats although it has all the hallmarks of his film genius. It is an entertaining and visually exciting silent melodrama. This version has a music score added.

Adapted from the novel by Joseph Connolly.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>An intense urban drama, set in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen and interpreted by many critics as an unofficial sequel to Scorsese&#8217;s iconic &#8220;Taxi driver&#8221;, &#8220;Bringing out the dead&#8221; examines one man&#8217;s crisis of conscience as he battles the furious demons that occupy his soul and the sullied streets where he works as a paramedic. Set in early 1990s, Scorsese evokes a New York awash with filth, human degradation, violence, drug abuse and amorality. Nicolas Cage puts in an incendiary performance as Frank - a man struggling to locate his compassion amid the overwhelming cruelty that rages around him. His (then wife) Patricia Arquette also puts in a fine performance as Mary Burke, the daughter of a patient Frank has brought in. Mary, a virgin/whore figure who similarly rages at the injustices and inequities of life, may save Frank - as he rescues her from drug addiction. In this redemptive tale Frank inches towards salvation - dragging the ghosts of the unsaved with him.

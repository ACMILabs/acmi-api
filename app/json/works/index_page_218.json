Driven by Raoul Walsh&#8217;s keen direction and Cagney&#8217;s vivid, hypnotic characterisation, &#8220;White Heat&#8221; won Life Magazine&#8217;s kudos as a wild and exciting picture of mayhem and madness.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954706, "name": "Raoul Walsh", "creator_id": 23604, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954705, "name": "Louis F.

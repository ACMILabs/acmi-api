It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes of Billy’s travels on the steamship Southern Cross, in 1960 which travelled between Australia and Europe. It is a little difficult to locate exactly where Billy visits but we can definitely see scenes of England, the Netherlands and Greece. The SS Southern Cross was a modern passenger ship built in 1955 to an innovative design which catered specifically for the tourist trade, starting a trend of ‘aft-engined’ ships, leaving more space for passengers and their needs. The Southern Cross was also the first major liner to have no cargo space, other than for ship&#8217;s stores and passenger luggage.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 views of a shoreline and sea<br />\n00:01:14:00 a large ship or ferry being loaded at the dock<br />\n00:01:48:00 a large and busy tugboat<br />\n00:01:50:00 passengers playing tennis on the deck of a ship<br />\n00:02:30:00 South Africa Airways airplane on the tarmac<br />\n00:03:15:00 a large fountain in a town setting<br />\n00:03:49:00 mountain views followed by a picturesque river flowing through hills<br />\n00:04:23:00 passengers travelling from a ship, in what appears to be a large lifeboat, to shore<br />\n00:04:51:00 views of a large military memorial in a public square setting.<br />\n00:04:58:00 dancers in traditional costume give an exhibition of Greek folk dancing to passengers on board a ship.<br />\n00:06:19:00 town houses and buildings overlooking houseboats moored on the banks of a canal, with a sign for Grachten (canal)<br />\n00:06:58:00 tramcar in a town<br />\n00:07:14:00 a large and crowded beach<br />\n00:07:36:00 street scenes<br />\n00:08:15:00 keen swimmers in a canal or river<br />\n00:08:24:00 a glimpse of a windmill<br />\n00:08:50:00 boats, ferries and yachts in a bay<br />\n00:09:30:00 a passenger ship arrives at a dock<br />\n00:10:54:00 scenes of lovely hills and farmlands, thatched cottages and beaches<br />\n00:12:15:00 a &#8216;Punch and Judy&#8217; tent indicates that Billy is in England<br />\n00:14:50:00 a plane is filmed overhead<br />\n00:15:15:00 a Greek &#8216;Evezone&#8217; presidential guard dressed in traditional costume<br />\n00:16:16:00 a spectacular view of mountain seen at the end of a street, behind shops and buildings, probably in Greece</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[William Darbyshire Home Movies: Reel 12]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>William Darbyshire</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, c. 1960</p>", "description": "<p>William (Billy) Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911.

Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film features a parade of cars, trucks and buses in Ballarat and a visit to a swimming pool where Jack includes some special effects of diving into the pool. There is also a scene where two women are posing for the camera next to a car. It becomes evident that the older stately woman is shy of the camera but the endearing younger woman is very confident as she clowns around in her very 1940s trousers and beret outfit.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 a parade of vehicles in Ballarat<br />\n00:00:50:00 two women stand in front of a car; one is joking around for the camera<br />\n00:01:05:00 at a swimming pool, a group of women onlookers watch a men diving into the water; the motion is reversed in a special effect so that we watch the diving in and back out of the pool<br />\n00:02:25:00 swimmers give an exhibition of the Australian Crawl (freestyle)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:01:56:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Special effects", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Rural conditions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Fashion - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Clothing and dress - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "History&nbsp;→ Women's clothing - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Diving", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming pools", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1123191, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 369, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/Fsq-_5OYBFQ"}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "9.5mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to England during 1962 to 1964. On his travel Billy films views of London, English coastlines and towns, including Blackpool, Brighton and Coventry. A feature of this film is the Coventry Cathedral which Billy filmed, possibly when it was being consecrated in 1962.

Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows various scenes of life in the Anderson family, including the kids riding a dirt bike, holidays at the beach, and birthday parties.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 family and friends arriving to the house with presents<br />\n00:02:03:00 all the kids taking turns on the new Honda dirt bike<br />\n00:05:42:00 relaxing at the beach<br />\n00:06:12:00 on the dirt bike track<br />\n00:08:30:00 riding the dirt bike on the beach<br />\n00:10:38:00 couple lounging on the beach<br />\n00:11:15:00 teenage girls laughing at the camera<br />\n00:12:55:00 boy carrying four ice cream cones dripping on him<br />\n00:13:29:00 cricket in the front yard<br />\n00:14:01:00 Marie and friends on the beach in stylish sunglasses and bikinis<br />\n00:14:24:00 boogie boarding<br />\n00:16:49:00 cooking sausages on an open BBQ<br />\n00:17:00:00 horse riding on a bush trail<br />\n00:19:15:00 kids’ birthday party<br />\n00:20:02:00 birthday cake with ‘Happy Birthday Paul’ on top<br />\n00:20:08:00 kids’ bike gang<br />\n00:20:38:00 musical chairs<br />\n00:21:42:00 boy animatedly blowing out candles<br />\n00:23:19:00 kids taking turns on the trampoline<br />\n00:26:31:00 slow motion trampoline jumping</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:28:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1337397, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller. The films were made on Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains footage of a visit to the Gresswell Sanatorium in Mont Park, Victoria, which at the time housed and treated male patients with tuberculosis. Mont Park was an area north-east of Melbourne comprising several health institutions, including the Gresswell Sanatorium which was named after Dan Gresswell, a public health administrator. The film provides an insightful look at life in the sanatorium, including recreational activities and health care.</p>\n<p>This film was made on Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 great example of a handpainted sign reading &#8216;Repatriation Sanatorium, Drive Slow, Gresswell Sanatorium&#8217;<br />\n00:00:13:00 a 1940s style bus with logo &#8216;Heidelberg Motor Omnibus Service Pty.

Anderson (1924–1993) was a film distributor, cinema owner and photographer as well as an enthusiastic filmmaker in and around Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.

filmmaker in and around Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.

As per the genre, Howard has an equally nebbish fiancee, who is of course but a minor obstacle in the course of true love. The film scores lots of laughs with a series of mixed up suitcases, missing jewels, an extensive chase scene, and romantic interludes. &#8220;What&#8217;s up Doc?&#8221; manages a successful mix of rapid fire dialogue, physical comedy and charming lead performances, which made it one of the big hits of 1972, the second in a row for director Peter Bogdanovich (The Last Picture show, Paper moon, The Cat&#8217;s meow). Features several songs by Barbra Streisand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;â†’ Romantic comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;â†’ Screwball comedies", "Comedy&nbsp;â†’ Slapstick comedies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;â†’ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/whats-up-doc", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962065, "name": "Saticoy Productions", "creator_id": 67975, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962066, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962067, "name": "Peter Bogdanovich", "creator_id": 68003, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50869", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [32826], "external_references": [{"id": 2397, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1356241"}, {"id": 6595, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "6949"}]}, {"id": 85472, "acmi_id": "306872", "title": "What's eating Gilbert Grape?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "whats-eating-gilbert-grape", "creator_credit": "Matalon Teper Ohlsson Production, J and M Entertainment, Meir Teper, Bertil Ohlsson, David Matalon and Lasse Hallstrom", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1993", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>From the acclaimed director of &#8220;My life as a dog&#8221;, &#8220;What&#8217;s eating Gilbert Grape?&#8221; is a moving and at times comic portrayal of an unusual family in a small town.

Set in Warsaw between 1936-42, &#8220;Korczak&#8221; reveals the rise of German occupation within the city and the segregation of Jews from non-Jews. The degradation of Jews within the city-streets at the hands of the Germans is harrowing, and heightened by the use of archive newsreel footage. Korczak establishes an orphanage for the city&#8217;s lost Jewish children and works to protect them against the encroaching threat of Nazi Germany. He is revealed to be a man of enormous compassion, with a ceaseless capacity to nurture and provide, and the ultimate selflessness to accompany the children to their inevitable death. Evocatively shot in black and white by Robby Muller, with a script by Agnieszka Holland and directed by established Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, &#8220;Korczak&#8221; is a deeply moving story about the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust and the choice to face racial discrimination and genocide with dignity and resolve. The film&#8217;s finale, however, provides one of the most magical sequences in the history of cinema. In Polish with English subtitles. Cast includes Wojciech Pszoniak, Ewa Dalkowska.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Polish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Warsaw (Poland)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Children and war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Europe", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Poland", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Poland", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "Places&nbsp;→ Warsaw (Poland)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 811140, "name": "Andrzej Wajda", "creator_id": 12666, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811139, "name": "Wolfgang Hantke", "creator_id": 33805, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811138, "name": "Studio Filmowe \"Perspektwa\"", "creator_id": 33804, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49823", "production_places": [{"id": 44, "name": "Poland", "slug": "poland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [31865]}, {"id": 82863, "acmi_id": "304037", "title": "Koorie culture, Koorie control (A)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "koorie-culture-koorie-control-a", "creator_credit": "Russell Porter, Lucy MacLaren, Museum Victoria, Film Victoria and Mozo Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Through a series of interviews with members of Victorian Aboriginal communities, this video gives a broad understanding of the unwritten and undocumented history of Victoria.

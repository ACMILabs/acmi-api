Several red herrings increase the intensity of the murder mystery, but the real concern of the film is the kaleidoscope of human failings and interactions, reflecting a complex interweaving of intent and desire. Paul Kelly&#8217;s score serves as an effective moody soundtrack to the film. Winner of eight AFI awards. Cinematography by Mandy Walker. Cast includes Anthony La Paglia, Geoffrey Rush, Barbara Hershey, Kerry Armstrong, Rachael Blake, Vince Colosimo, Peter Phelps, Leah Purcell, Glenn Robins.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962780, "name": "Ray Lawrence", "creator_id": 9735, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962779, "name": "Jan Chapman", "creator_id": 3383, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962778, "name": "Saddleback Productions", "creator_id": 26195, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962777, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962776, "name": "MBP", "creator_id": 35432, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962775, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20053, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/nTEUCdpDsfVDZJ5H0ndP1EmVtj.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Lantana (Ray Lawrence) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51257", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33134]}]}

Thrust into the role of protector, Kuki forces Lamia into hiding, where she soon discovers a devastating truth about herself that could explain why the CIA, French agents, and a group of expatriate Transylvanian vampires are so desperate to lay claim to her. As Kuki gets closer to solving the enigma, deceptions are revealed, blood spurts freely, and the body count escalates at an alarming pace. A violent and testosterone-charged anime adaptation of the hard-boiled science fiction novel by Kiyoshi Kasai.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Anime", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996550, "name": "Kuzuhisa Takenouchi", "creator_id": 79967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996549, "name": "Akira Sasaki", "creator_id": 79966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996548, "name": "Toei Animation", "creator_id": 66137, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50253", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [32244], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92748, "acmi_id": "316067", "title": "I, monster", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-monster", "creator_credit": "Stephen Weeks, Milton Subotsky, Max J Rosenberg, British Lion Films and Amicus Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on a story by Robert Louis Stevenson called &#8220;The Strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&#8221;, published in 1886, &#8220;I, monster&#8221; although using different names for the main characters, mostly remains faithful to the original Jekyll and Hyde plot.

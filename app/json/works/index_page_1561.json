Many yachts sought shelter, crew members were injured and one man was lost overboard. Sea-Safety Canberra, assisted by 4 fixed wing aircraft, mounted an unsuccessful search which covered more than 2,500 square kilometres. Each year Sea-Safety covers approximately 1,800 incidents, including ships running aground, cargo vessels adrift, pleasure craft in trouble. This video looks at the methods employed, and the resources available, in order to maintain efficient and prompt sea safety services to all who require them.

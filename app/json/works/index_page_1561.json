The film scores lots of laughs with a series of mixed up suitcases, missing jewels, an extensive chase scene, and romantic interludes. &#8220;What&#8217;s up Doc?&#8221; manages a successful mix of rapid fire dialogue, physical comedy and charming lead performances, which made it one of the big hits of 1972, the second in a row for director Peter Bogdanovich (The Last Picture show, Paper moon, The Cat&#8217;s meow). Features several songs by Barbra Streisand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Slapstick comedies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962067, "name": "Peter Bogdanovich", "creator_id": 68003, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962066, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962065, "name": "Saticoy Productions", "creator_id": 67975, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19904, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/spIMsfEQQXlNRsjFHalVMnNqv69.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "What's up Doc?

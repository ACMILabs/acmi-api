Through her we meet Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a dangerous loner who, when provoked, protrudes steel blades out of his knuckles, as well as meeting the rest of the X-men who reside in a special school set up by the wheel chair bound and telepathic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Of course every super hero must have it&#8217;s villain, and a powerful foe is created in the mysterious and tormented Magnetto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has the ability to harness magnetic energy and wants to start a war between the intolerant humans and the mutants.

Memo has the important roles in the village of postman, which also involves reading the mail to the illiterate, and shepherd. He lives there with his mother and young sister whilst his father works in The Netherlands in a shipyard. Memo&#8217;s happy, innocent existence is thrown into chaos one day when his father decides to relocate the family to The Netherlands to escape the dangers of the oncoming war in Turkey. Memo responds to this unhappy event by deciding to stop talking. A subplot involving illegal immigrants exposes their vulnerability and their exploitation at the hands of shady business owners. This gently observed film explores the effects that cultural dislocation has on children and their families.

The story is from a novella and concerns a wealthy Macao merchant, Mr Clay (Welles) who attempts to prove his power by making an old seaman&#8217;s legend into fact. Welles cleverly uses the original story as a basis of a philosophical inquisition. Cast includes Orson Welles, Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. Music by Eric Satie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - France"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 793669, "name": "Albina Productions", "creator_id": 28635, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 793670, "name": "Office de Radiodiffusion Television Francais", "creator_id": 16195, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 793671, "name": "Micheline Rozan", "creator_id": 28636, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 793672, "name": "Orson Welles", "creator_id": 66876, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 793668, "name": "Museum of the Moving Image (BFI)", "creator_id": 77014, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42876", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [26136]}]}

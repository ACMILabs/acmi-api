Cassie speaks about her foray into nursing as something unfortunately rare for a woman brought up in the western suburbs. Kerryn talks about the sense that it was only in her third year as a registered nurse that the &#8216;big picture&#8217; of what nursing demands hit her. And Trish articulates the mixed feelings involved in working with homeless psychiatric patients, of &#8220;having to force people to do something they don&#8217;t want to do, but knowing that if you don&#8217;t they end up in pain, vulnerable and traumatised&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Nurses - In-service training", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1118544, "name": "Ivo Burum", "creator_id": 26757, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1118543, "name": "Helen Gaynor", "creator_id": 74823, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1118542, "name": "Alfred Hospital", "creator_id": 79602, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1118541, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1118540, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115555, "acmi_id": "S01386", "title": "Nurses", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "nurses", "creator_credit": "Ivo Burum, Helen Gaynor, Alfred Hospital and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 91614, "acmi_id": "314757", "title": "Coping with death", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "coping-with-death", "creator_credit": "Ivo Burum, Helen Gaynor, Alfred Hospital and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 91615, "acmi_id": "314758", "title": "Is there life after death?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "is-there-life-after-death", "creator_credit": "Ivo Burum, Helen Gaynor, Alfred Hospital and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 91613, "acmi_id": "314756", "title": "Work around the clock", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "work-around-the-clock", "creator_credit": "Ivo Burum, Helen Gaynor, Alfred Hospital and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48990", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31102]}, {"id": 115555, "acmi_id": "S01386", "title": "Nurses", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "nurses", "creator_credit": "Ivo Burum, Helen Gaynor, Alfred Hospital and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This is real reality TV.

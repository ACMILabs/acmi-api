These three decide to expand their gang and recruit Spleen man (poisonous farts), The Bowler, Invisible Boy and The Sphinx who can shave metal with his mind. &#8220;Mystery men&#8221;, which had a reasonable budget and contains some impressive special effects, lost big money at the box office when it was released. Despite this the film successfully satirises the genre and is loaded with subversive humour that makes it an interesting comedy. The cast of great comedic talents includes Ben Stiller, Janeane Garafolo, Eddie Izzard, Hank Azaria and Paul Reubens.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Cartoon characters", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Comic books, strips, etc.", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic books, strips, etc.", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963130, "name": "Kinka Usher", "creator_id": 80511, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963129, "name": "Lloyd Levin", "creator_id": 72781, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963128, "name": "Mike Richardson", "creator_id": 51811, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963127, "name": "Lawrence Gordon", "creator_id": 69681, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963126, "name": "Dark Horse Entertainment", "creator_id": 51762, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963125, "name": "Golar", "creator_id": 80510, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963124, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963123, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20120, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3O2uzpG97ndCeAWgS22rNB2xL6N.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Mystery men (Kinka Usher) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51586", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33341]}, {"id": 78773, "acmi_id": "017471", "title": "Mystery island", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mystery-island", "creator_credit": "Gene Scott and Andromeda Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1980", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/017471_MysteryIsland_slick_1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This adventure story involves a smuggling racket, a mysterious character and a ship wreck on a desert island - all set in the beautiful Northern Queensland reef islands!

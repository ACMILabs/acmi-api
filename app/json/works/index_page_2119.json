The camera has captured some rather up-close and disturbing images of the physical violence dealt by the police to the protesters, particularly in the first two days of the Summit.

This led to a heightened reaction from the Police on Day 2 resulting in the injuring and hospitalisation of 30 protesters. By Day 3, with a smaller crowd of protesters in attendance, and a somewhat calmer atmosphere between police and protesters, the focus of S-11 turned to the effects of globalisation on women and indigenous people around the world.

Treasurer) and inside footage of speakers at the Summit, the highlight of which was Dr Vandana Shiva speaking on behalf of the young people of Australia and the world.

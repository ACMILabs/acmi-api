Based on a play by Canadian writer Brad Fraser, &#8220;Love and human remains&#8221; is a dark comedy, which at times presents a very dim view of humanity. A sub plot in the film tracks a serial killer stalking David and Candy&#8217;s neighbourhood. Stars: Thomas Gibson, Ruth Marshall, Mia Kirshner and Cameron Bancroft.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canada", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Literature&nbsp;→ Canadian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997856, "name": "Denys Arcand", "creator_id": 27472, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q363231", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997855, "name": "Roger Frappier", "creator_id": 27470, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3438982", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997854, "name": "Max Films", "creator_id": 27469, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997853, "name": "Atlantis Films Limited", "creator_id": 35270, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51077", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [33010]}, {"id": 93505, "acmi_id": "316957", "title": "Tears of the black tiger = Fah talai jone", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tears-of-the-black-tiger-fah-talai-jone-dvd", "creator_credit": "Wisit Sasanatieng, Nonzee Nimibutr, Five Star Productions, Film Bangkok and Aichi Arts Centre", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Thailand, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44076, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3063172"}], "brief_description": "<p>A story of ill-fated love between a peasant boy and a wealthy city girl; a film about the notorious &#8220;Black Tiger&#8221;, a Thai rural gang member with a touch of the Robin Hoods about him; and the story of how Black Tiger has to choose between love and the call of the outlaw past.

The importance of drenching early, when the sheep are fat, is stressed; breeding ewes should be drenched before lambing, especially before autumn lambing, so that the lambs do not become heavily infected; lambs should be drenched at weaning; drenching should be done fairly regularly every four to five weeks from autumn until spring, the wetter the season the more frequent should the treatment be.

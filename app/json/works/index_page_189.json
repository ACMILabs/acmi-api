Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold) is a sensitive young poet who naively decides to leave the safety of Oslo and his girlfriend Gertrude (Camilla Martens) to embark on a fur-trapping expedition to Greenland for twelve months. It is the year 1925. On arrival at the east coast of Greenland, Henrik is teamed up with two experienced trappers, the rough and intimidating Randbek (Stellan Skarsgard) and the quieter introspective scientist, Holm (Bjorn Sundquist). Their living quarters for the twelve months is a tiny isolated hut in the bleak icy sparseness of the Greenland wastelands where tension and conflict between the three escalates to unimaginable heights, and man&#8217;s inhumanity to man emerges as more than just a threat. This is an outstanding film by Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland (The Last lieutenant) full of atmosphere and ambience and a stark beauty which underlies the ugliness and volatility smouldering beneath the surface. Stellan Skarsgard (The Unbearable lightness of being, The Hunt for Red October, Breaking the Waves, Simple minded murderer) and Gard B. Eidsvold (The Last lieutenant) each bring to their role a passionate intensity and a chilling reality of the human condition in adverse circumstances.

Elliot confounds viewer expectations offering up more extreme and vulgar outback personalities than could possibly be imagined, making these characters repugnant to watch. The film slyly sends up films such as &#8220;Crocodile Dundee&#8221; which pandered to the gross stereotypes that so appealed to audiences. Elliot however failed to appeal to anyone with this bizarre and subversive flick, receiving critical brickbats and woeful box office returns.<br />\nCast includes: Johnathon Schaech, Rod Taylor, Susie Porter,  Richard Moir, Maggie Kirkpatrick, Barry Humphries and Paul Mercurio</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/welcome-to-woop-woop", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998313, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2094420", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998312, "name": "Finola Dwyer", "creator_id": 71846, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998311, "name": "Unthank Films", "creator_id": 35621, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998310, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998309, "name": "Scala Productions", "creator_id": 35620, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33223], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93718, "acmi_id": "317299", "title": "But I'm a cheerleader", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "but-im-a-cheerleader", "creator_credit": "Jamie Babbit, Leanna Creel, Andrea Sperling, HKM Films, The Kusher-Locke Company, Ignite Entertainment and Franchise Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Paying a large debt to the films of John Waters, &#8220;But I&#8217;m a cheerleader&#8221; takes a satiric look at teenage sexuality through the experience of Megan (Natasha Lyonne), whose parents believe her to be a lesbian.

Monica has planned a party but as the night wears on and no-one arrives she drinks, stresses and stews over her life. Her cousin Val and friend Stephie, wander around the city in search of the party, hooking up with two neo-punks Tom and Dave. Kevin bemoans his fate having been dumped the night before by performance artist Ellie, and is comforted by a friend Lucy, to whom he is forming an attraction. The film follows the dozen or so intended guests as they make their way to the party via taxis, nightclubs and cafes. The film has an episodic structure, seeking to lay patterns of interconnectedness amidst a slew of characters. However no real depth of scale and social meaning is ever achieved. Instead the characters remain frivolous and shallow - but with a hip eighties soundtrack and a top cast, the film is an amusing diversion.

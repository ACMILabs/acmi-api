Nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay and Best Actress.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Based on the true story of Augusto and Michaela Odene (Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte), &#8220;Lorenzo&#8217;s oil&#8221; dramatises the plight of two determined parents who set out to find treatment for their son against a wall of bureaucracy and medical indeterminancy. Returning from their life in East Africa, the Odene family have settled in Washington D.C. when their world is turned upside down by 5 year old son Lorenzo (Zack O&#8217;Malley Greenburg) who starts displaying &#8220;disturbing behaviour&#8221; at school. After a series of lengthy medical tests, it&#8217;s revealed that Lorenzo is suffering from Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a degenerative disease carried by mothers and passed on to sons. Doctors give Lorenzo a life expectancy of only 2 more years and a horrendous series of side affects until then. A relatively new disease, medical experts have little hope to offer in regards to treatment or cure. Unflagging against insurmountable odds, the Odenes set out researching the disease themselves and communicating with other families afflicted by ALD. Their search leads them to an experimental oil aimed at toning down the side effects of the disease but which also carries a fair amount of risk. A sentimental film that was relatively well received by critics, this is a medical drama of individual success against medical cynicism. Cast also includes Peter Ustinov, Laura Linney, Kathleen Wilhoite and Gerry Bamman.

Dispatched to Europe to hunt down the only two other copies known to exist, Corso soon finds himself enmeshed in a mystery of epic proportions as he follows a trail of clues, encounters eccentric bibliophiles, is relentlessly pursued by a widening circle of deadly foes and is rescued by an enigmatic and ubiquitous green-eyed beauty. As the people he has been dealing with in relation to the book begin to die under bizarre circumstances, Corso must locate the missing images, both to save his own skin and to resolve his own growing obsession with the arcane legend of the book. Stars Johnny Depp as Corso, Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, Lena Olin as Liana Telfer, and Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Devil", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Occultism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Satanism", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Books", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Books", "Literature&nbsp;→ Booksellers and bookselling", "Literature&nbsp;→ Latin American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Devil"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-ninth-gate", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996121, "name": "Roman Polanski", "creator_id": 10072, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51552", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996120, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996119, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49962", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [31977]}, {"id": 92474, "acmi_id": "315758", "title": "Tokyo Olympiad [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tokyo-olympiad-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Kon Ichikawa, Suketaro Taguchi, 13th Olympic Games Organising Committee and Toho Kabushiki Kaisha", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1965", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47644, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q427799"}], "brief_description": "<p>Ichikawa&#8217;s compression of the many hours of footage shot by 164 cameramen using 1031 cameras at the 1964 Olympics is the only sporting documentary to rival Riefenstahl&#8217;s Olympia.

Andrew, a chronic procrastinator and small-time dreamer is happily married to Wendy, an eternally sunny woman. They live with their twin daughters Natalie, a plumber with a simple outlook on life, and Nicola, an ill-tempered misanthrope who nurses a secret eating disorder. When not bickering, the girls share mutual contempt for their parents, who they regard as quite batty.

Leigh&#8217;s protagonists are full of nuance, extremely endearing and quite credible. Despite the weighty subject matter that he mines, Leigh maintains a whimsical tone, whilst slowly revealing the frustrations and setbacks that fester under the daily grind.

So is the love of human beings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The film focuses on the plight of orphaned children, in this case mostly from natural disasters, and the &#8220;SOS Villages&#8221;, founded in China to provide a more nurturing environment for the traumatised young survivors.</p>\n<p>The film opens dramatically with an infant crying out for their mother, amid the destruction of a horrendous volcano eruption. This sets the scene for a collection of young boys and girls, who have been orphaned and sent to one of these  &#8220;SOS villages&#8221;, modeled on the first post-World War II institutions founded by Austrian Doctor Germanile. The village is a collection of several households, with the half-dozen children in each being watched over by a single &#8220;auntie&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The oldest and most rabid of these orphans is Pi Tao, who had to be forcibly separated from his only remaining companion, a mangy dog by the name of Huazi. He enjoys hunting birds (to eat) and is quick to brandish his knife. Living on the street has proven a hard life, and earlier abuse by his grandparents has taught him to assert himself by bullying others and attention win attention with violence. Pi Tao exerts a strong influence as an older role model over the younger children, who are not only young and impressionable but extremely sensitive. They often express this deep psychological trauma at nighttime, which therefore ends up being one of the more lively times of the day. The children suffer from terrifying nightmares, sleepwalk on the roof, and are prone to invite a variety of mischief that ends in the whole village being woken up.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the unrest precipitated by the mental scars of these kids takes a certain toll on their adoptive &#8220;aunties&#8221;, who through loyalty to their children are often forced to come to loggerheads with the other guardians in the village.</p>\n<p>The three aunties featured in the film are neatly stereotyped as; Meng Qiaoling  &#8220;the strong one&#8221;, Yang Qing &#8220;The inexperienced — but pretty — youthful one&#8221;, and Bai Jin &#8220;the homely old widowed one&#8221;. As the film progresses their own personal stories unfold, explaining not only their backgrounds and reasons for taking on this role, but also the social stigmas associated with single mothers, adoption, orphans and the lack of a support network for those in desperate need of loving care but are denied it.</p>\n<p>The moral of the film, like most others of the period, is that human beings are inherently good, and should therefore be prepared to compromise with the shortcomings and difficulties in associating with others. However, it also touches a much deeper and more fundamental nerve that stretches across all barriers, that society can only function humanely if its people remember their own natural desire to love and be loved, despite the risks of pain engendered through such ventures.  With that said, viewers should not expect to be thoroughly entertained, as the film is often rather tedious and dry.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 6, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Childrens Films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homeless children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aggressiveness (Psychology) in children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865460, "name": "Wang Hanchang", "creator_id": 82384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865456, "name": "Lu Ping", "creator_id": 82381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865455, "name": "Children's Film Studio (China)", "creator_id": 82253, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865466, "name": "Shanghai Film Orchestra", "creator_id": 82388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865465, "name": "Zhang Xi", "creator_id": 82261, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865464, "name": "Fang Fang", "creator_id": 82387, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865463, "name": "Ding Jiali", "creator_id": 82273, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865462, "name": "Qiao Chen", "creator_id": 82386, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865461, "name": "Cheng Xiaolong", "creator_id": 82385, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865459, "name": "Wang Jiuwen", "creator_id": 82374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865458, "name": "Wang Zhebin", "creator_id": 82383, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865457, "name": "Wang Xingdong", "creator_id": 82382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146408", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [55256], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115761, "acmi_id": "Z000019", "title": "Miss Jiao Jiao = Jiao Jiao Xiao Jie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "miss-jiao-jiao-jiao-jiao-xiao-jie", "creator_credit": "Ma Yi, Chen Jinshu and Beijing Children's Film Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Jin Xiaolong has a close relationship with the animal world.

For the most part, however, the film is a social commentary on the depressing state of the love lives of Zuo Li, the leading lady, and her friends, who represent the key stereotypes of women in their late twenties.</p>\n<p>Zuo Li is a woman living in Beijing who seems to have everything going for her. Known to her friends as Lili, she is beautiful, fun, smart and highly successful as a philosopher working with state-of-the-art technology. Yet despite all her merits Lili just can&#8217;t seem to nail herself to a man. Her parents are beginning to worry as she is about to reach her thirtieth year, and the countless would-be suitors either can&#8217;t live up to her unrealistic expectations, or are too intimidated by her success to find her an attractive prospect for a wife.</p>\n<p>Lili attends her friend&#8217;s exchanging of vows, which are conducted simultaneously with hundreds of others as part of a mass wedding. After they are pronounced man and wife, her friends prod her to explain how she came to meet this mystery man. Her reply shocks them all: &#8220;The Marriage Bureau.&#8221; She, like many women her age, have succumbed to the huge social pressure placed on women to settle down and left fate to a computer database.

While this is happening, though, all of a sudden a mysterious ghost with smoke coming from its head attacks them and steals Zhang&#8217;s son back. Unfortunately, though, Zhang&#8217;s ninja tricks do not seem to work on fellow ninjas, and he and his son are imprisoned together by the foreigners.</p>\n<p>Whilst en route to Sydney, in order to make everything nice and legal, they are told they must sign a 5-year contract. The men try to rebel several times, but each time are quashed. Things get more difficult each time, as the abductees begin to realise that many of their fellow &#8220;slaves&#8221; were willing participants. Some had debts, while others had committed crimes or were wanted by the authorities. However, when they are forced to cut off their cues, the originally willing labourers join in the revolt, setting a huge fire in their holding cell below deck. They break out through the floorboards and seize ship.</p>\n<p>At the end of the struggle the last foreigner sets fire to the fuel, before throwing himself overboard with a lifesaver. Everyone is forced to abandon ship, and the foreigners attempt to use the government to reign in the escapees. Jinlong and Yuankun&#8217;s brother are led back in chains to be executed. At the last minute Jinlong&#8217;s love comes to him and ask if they can die together.</p>\n<p>In an intensely powerful scene the lovers are both decapitated.<br />\n(4 stars: James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:16:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Chinese - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Emigration and immigration - Psychological aspects", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Chinese - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Emigration and immigration - Psychological aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Slave-trade", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ Slave labor", "History&nbsp;→ Slave-trade", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865394, "name": "Zhou Tingmei", "creator_id": 82317, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865391, "name": "Li Wenhua", "creator_id": 82314, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865390, "name": "Gao Zhenhe", "creator_id": 82313, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865389, "name": "Hong Yonghong", "creator_id": 82312, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865388, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865398, "name": "Pan Rufei", "creator_id": 82321, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865397, "name": "Pan Yuankun", "creator_id": 82320, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865396, "name": "Zhang Tianyi", "creator_id": 82319, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865395, "name": "Tang Jinlong", "creator_id": 82318, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865393, "name": "Ren Zhixin", "creator_id": 82316, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865392, "name": "Ma Linfa", "creator_id": 82315, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146400", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [55248], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115753, "acmi_id": "Z000011", "title": "Yamaha fish stall = Ya Ma Ha yu dang", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "yamaha-fish-stall-ya-ma-ha-yu-dang", "creator_credit": "Li Yingshuang, Zhang Liang and Pearl River Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1984", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The film depicts the impact of China&#8217;s economic reform on ordinary people in the early 1980s.

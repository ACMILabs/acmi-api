In June 1922, civil governor of Guangdong, Chen Jiongming attacked Sun Yat-sen’s residence and forced him to escape. Sun’s friend and assistant Liao Zhongkai was arrested. Although Chen released Liao due to pressure from different parties, Liao was on Chen’s hit list. Liao and his wife escaped to Shanghai to meet Sun Yat-sen with help from friends.<br />\nThe 1920s was a time that China’s Qing dynasty had been overthrown and warlords and different political parties were all competing for power.

With that said, viewers should not expect to be thoroughly entertained, as the film is often rather tedious and dry.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 6, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Childrens Films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homeless children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aggressiveness (Psychology) in children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Emotional and behavioral difficulties in children", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865460, "name": "Wang Hanchang", "creator_id": 82384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865456, "name": "Lu Ping", "creator_id": 82381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865455, "name": "Children's Film Studio (China)", "creator_id": 82253, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865466, "name": "Shanghai Film Orchestra", "creator_id": 82388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865465, "name": "Zhang Xi", "creator_id": 82261, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865464, "name": "Fang Fang", "creator_id": 82387, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865463, "name": "Ding Jiali", "creator_id": 82273, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865462, "name": "Qiao Chen", "creator_id": 82386, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865461, "name": "Cheng Xiaolong", "creator_id": 82385, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865459, "name": "Wang Jiuwen", "creator_id": 82374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865458, "name": "Wang Zhebin", "creator_id": 82383, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865457, "name": "Wang Xingdong", "creator_id": 82382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146408", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [55256], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115761, "acmi_id": "Z000019", "title": "Miss Jiao Jiao = Jiao Jiao Xiao Jie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "miss-jiao-jiao-jiao-jiao-xiao-jie", "creator_credit": "Ma Yi, Chen Jinshu and Beijing Children's Film Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Jin Xiaolong has a close relationship with the animal world.

Her reply shocks them all: &#8220;The Marriage Bureau.&#8221; She, like many women her age, have succumbed to the huge social pressure placed on women to settle down and left fate to a computer database. Entering her requirements into a computer at the Marriage Bureau allows women to scientifically deduce what kind of man she could marry. Then the computer searches its database for suitable husbands.</p>\n<p>However, this pair does not seem to fit well at all, and the wife will be all alone because husband works in the suburbs. The connotation here being that she has become so desperate that she doesn&#8217;t mind if he sleeps around. The friends are not at all impressed with his obvious character flaws. He appears to enjoy drinking and displays no affection or interest toward his new wife.<br />\nAll of Lili&#8217;s friends seem to express their shortcomings as a result of this extreme pressure to marry, allowing us to conclude that if society promoted true sexual equality then women would be free to achieve their true potential for happiness, and not be forced into the humiliating situation where they must compromise their integrity to conform with social norms.</p>\n<p>Lili sums up her own plight: In her heart, she loves a country yokel who is right now galloping around on the back of a dirty horse in the middle of nowhere, chasing a bunch of sheep. It is inconceivable to her parents and friends that she sacrifice what they consider the brightest future of the lot in order to go off into the middle of nowhere. However, she eventually realises there is no way to be happy other than to bite the bullet and follow her own heart.</p>\n<p>Back on the plains, a letter arrives for Sulun Zhabu. He gets very excited and takes off on his horse. He waits at the bus stop, but no one comes. When Lili does finally arrive she is bereaved to discover Sulun has died (presumably of a broken heart, as he was very fit). Lili says to herself &#8220;Sulun, please forgive me&#8221;. It seems she strived to little too late for the love of her life.<br />\nThe film ends on a sombre note, but with a renewed sense of determination to find again what she calls &#8220;the gaze of love she&#8217;s felt before&#8221; on her. The gaze that belongs to me.&#8221;<br />\n(James Donald - 4 stars; 10 June, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnic groups", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "Literature&nbsp;→ Chinese literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865429, "name": "Wang Zhihua", "creator_id": 82288, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865425, "name": "Urshana", "creator_id": 82345, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865424, "name": "Inner Mongolia Film Studio", "creator_id": 82344, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865434, "name": "Wei Jiawen", "creator_id": 82353, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865433, "name": "Wu Huiming", "creator_id": 82352, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865432, "name": "Zhou Guobin", "creator_id": 82351, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865431, "name": "G.E.

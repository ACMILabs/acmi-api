The image sets the premise of the piece but not necessarily the tone, which vacillates between hope and despair. Kanji&#8217;s physical and mental health is not only damaged by the cancer within, but as Kurosawa subtly suggests, is also contributed to by the inertia of Kanji&#8217;s civil service job and life in post-war Tokyo.

He eventually meets a girl who convinces him that he should spend his dying months doing good. This prompts him to seek approval for having a children&#8217;s playground built.

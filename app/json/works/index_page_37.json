filmmaker during the 1960s to the 1990s. Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is part one of two and is titled ‘Festival City’. Wallace and companions travel by car to Adelaide in South Australia, filming the trip as they go.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 titles ‘A Walkabout Film’, ‘Festival City’, ‘A WHC Film’<br />\n00:02:18:00 &#8216;Waterfalls Gully&#8217; enroute to Adelaide<br />\n00:03:15:00 women posing with their cameras for the filmmaker’s camera.<br />\n00:03:39:00 women standing in front of a rock walk before climbing.<br />\n00:04:49:00 Adelaide Arts Centre.<br />\n00:05:16:00 paddle boats and fountain on the Torrens River in Adelaide.<br />\n00:06:31:00 churches in Adelaide.<br />\n00:07:09:00 camping alongside a pop-up van.<br />\n00:08:06:00 looking at an outdoor art exhibition.<br />\n00:09:42:00 sheep in a paddock.<br />\n00:10:03:00 historic &#8216;Peerless Roller Mills&#8217; building in &#8216;Birdwood&#8217;, South Australia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:40:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Holidays", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rivers - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ South Australia - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Description and travel", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Rivers - Australia", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motor vehicles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Roads - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Clothing and dress - History", "History&nbsp;→ Historic buildings", "History&nbsp;→ Historic buildings - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ South Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "History&nbsp;→ Women's clothing - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Camping", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Hiking", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Outdoor recreation - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Walking", "Places&nbsp;→ Adelaide (S.

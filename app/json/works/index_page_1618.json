Carlo (Stafano Dionisi) is inseparable from his brother Riccardo (Enrio Lo Verso), a mediocre composer whose career depends solely on his brother&#8217;s enormous fame. Together the Broschi brothers conquer the courts of Europe, until they are embroilled in an artistic battle with Handel(Jeroen Crabbe) in England. Farinelli&#8217;s voice was created by digitally combining the voices of counter tenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas-Godlewska. Voted Best Foreign Language Film at 1995 Golden Globe Awards.

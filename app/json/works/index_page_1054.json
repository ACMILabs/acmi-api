Eventually Albert discovers his wife&#8217;s infidelity and takes violent revenge, triggering a more unusual retaliation from her. This film is a parable about love, revenge and most of all greed, it is both funny and horrifying. Sacha Vierny&#8217;s cinematography and Greenaway&#8217;s use of colour are superb. Also stars Tim Roth, Richard Bohringer and Alan Howard.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-and-her-lover", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1807859, "name": "Kees Kasander", "creator_id": 72935, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951053, "name": "Allarts Cook", "creator_id": 25173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951054, "name": "Erato FIlms", "creator_id": 25174, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951055, "name": "Films Incorporated", "creator_id": 12008, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951057, "name": "Peter Greenaway", "creator_id": 51033, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55282", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951052, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38952", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [22538], "external_references": [{"id": 2, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q661202"}, {"id": 5742, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "7452"}]}, {"id": 117624, "acmi_id": "509955", "title": "The Cook Strait story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-cook-strait-story", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1967", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1967-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>SUMMARY: The manufacture and installation of the Cook Strait submarine power cables for the New Zealand Electricity Department</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Cook Strait story</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 1967</p>", "description": "<p>SUMMARY: The manufacture and installation of the Cook Strait submarine power cables for the New Zealand Electricity Department</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>SUMMARY: The manufacture and installation of the Cook Strait submarine power cables for the New Zealand Electricity Department</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "163540", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [57118], "external_references": []}]}

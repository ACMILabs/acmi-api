In Judaism it is forbidden to marry outside the religion, Christians are against mixed marriages and Islam although condoning marriage by Muslim men with Jews or Christians do not condone marriage with Buddhists, Hindus or atheists. All the couples interviewed in this documentary have gone against the social, political and religious norms but in their personal narratives we see the human side of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the pain of being ex-communicated from unaccepting family and friends, of children growing up not knowing their grandparents, and of bitter prejudices of religious and racial intolerances.

Giovanni is a successful psychoanalyst residing in a quaint seaside town. He has a warm and tender relationship with his wife, and two adolescent children - son, Andrea and daughter, Irene. This family is loving and understanding, interested in one another and well adjusted. Focussing on Giovanni, he is depicted as affectionate and caring even as he worries about Andrea&#8217;s attitude and troubles at school. This idyllic calm is shattered when Andrea accidentally drowns and the remainder of the film examines how each individual family member adjusts to Andrea&#8217;s death, deals with their loss and how the family struggles on as a unit. Internalising his sorrow and guilt, Giovanni plays out endless streams of &#8216;what-ifs&#8217;, whilst his isolation corrodes his relationships with wife and daughter.

Written, directed and starring Moretti, &#8220;The Son&#8217;s room&#8221; is a poignant and compassionate work that is effective and understated as it gently examines the difficulties inherent within mourning and death.

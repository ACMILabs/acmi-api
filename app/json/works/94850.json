Fictional small Australian country town of Berkeley, renowned for its good fishing, is invaded by aliens that send strange meteors from space turning people into the undead - zombies.

The aliens appear on earth cleansing some folks with healing rain and they are then ascended to orbit the earth. The ending has the potential for a sequel and hopefully someone will give them the money! This is must see cult classic for those into the schlock/horror or low budget independent genre/s. Crew that deserve special mention are the make-up designer Steven Boyle, cinematographer Andrew Strahorn, composer Cliff Bradley and everyone that worked on the special effects, which includes the directors. (&#8220;The Making Of&#8221; in the extras is worth a look if you&#8217;re thinking of making a low budget feature!) Hopefully there will be more from The Spierig Brothers in the future.

Set in 1966, &#8220;Mima&#8221; is a beautifully rendered nostalgia and coming-of-age piece about identity, cultural displacement, family, and belonging. Existing between the worlds of children and adults, Mima can feel the demands of womanhood bearing down upon her as she is forced to make some alarming choices. Cast includes Virginie Ledoyen, Nino Manfredi, Margarita Lozano, Vittoria Scognamiglio and Patrick Bouchitey.

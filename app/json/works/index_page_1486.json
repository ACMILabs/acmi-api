Tibet is full of  military vehicles, all manned by ethnic Han Chinese. The beginning of this film is a curious one, which confronts the woman doctor with a festive group watching as young men play a shooting game. However, that is the most that the Chinese film is prepared to alight on that topic…</p>\n<p>This newly graduated woman doctor needs to get to the provincial town of Saitang to help the sick and needy, but the next bus is days from now. She decides to approach the liberation army for a ride from on a military supply vehicle. Walking through the rows of army trucks parked beside the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA) barracks, she finds a gruff Chinese platoon leader and propositions him (for a ride).</p>\n<p>The platoon leader — who has been having a rough time with his missus back in Beijing — refuses on the pretext of being superstitious of taking women into the highlands. Long story short, her determination ends up getting her a lift anyway. Her two travel companions are the platoon leader and a younger more naive recruit, optimistic and unfamiliar with the harsh wilderness of Tibet.</p>\n<p>Platoon leader sees life as being like an endless trek through the wilderness, fuelled only by a strong will, and the occasional drop of hard liquor. Despite the tough going there are absolutely beautiful shots of the countryside, with its verdant forests and pristine mountainscapes</p>\n<p>On their way they discover an old man who has come down with a bad case of malaria in the forest and decide to take him along. It turns out the man is a hunter, not used to company. He is rude, uncooth and presumptuous toward young Tibetan women: Not the kind of awkward company our female hero wants to be stuck in the back of a truck with. He wants to leave, and when she tries to stop him (because of his sickness) a suspicious article falls from his knapsack. It turns out he is selling valuable medical materials to India and Nepal.</p>\n<p>The truck breaks down and the young man and woman make for the nearest township on foot, braving the risk of death by freezing, and all the beasts of the Tibetan wilderness, such as bears, snowleopards and wolves. They encounter a pack of wolves and must fend them off with fire. Meanwhile, the platoon leader is stuck looking after the cheeky little Tibetan hunter, who sneaks out his stuff and makes a break for it. However he is saved from a close call with wolves by the gun-toting platoon leader.</p>\n<p>The following scene could sum up the entire film: A grumpy tired Chinese soldier carrying an unpleasant old Tibetan musk-smuggler through a terrible and enchantingly untamed wilderness.</p>\n<p>The platoon leader ends up getting along quite well with hunter, who is a wild man, but good at heart. He explains that he just doesn&#8217;t want to be poor forever. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army officer understands this ambition to be self-determining, and this is a central theme of the film.</p>\n<p>At its core, this is a film about the natural will of all people to be invested with freedom and responsibility for their own lives.</p>\n<p>The young couple are forced to turn back, the unarmed boy in disgrace. Meanwhile, the Tibetan woman&#8217;s true grit seems to have restored platoon leader&#8217;s faith in women as capable of feats of great valour, and keen wits to boot.

However, they may have gotten more than they bargained for, as these friends journey to revitalise the cultural traditions of post-Cultural Revolution China threatens to tear them apart.</p>\n<p>A bunch of foreigners enter a packed theatre to enjoy a performance of Classical Chinese Orchestral music. Featured amongst the instruments is a reproduction of the 2400-year-old massive chime bells (Bian Zhong) and Drums from the Chu Dynasty. The singing is accompanied with a beautiful chorus of bells struck by sticks. The songs are interluded with the applause and positive comments made by foreigners, reminiscences of the woman who organised the performance.</p>\n<p>After this musical introduction the film gradually recounts the trials and tribulations associated with staging this massive production, breaking up the rather strained narrative with beautifully composed interpretations of these classical tunes.</p>\n<p>The orchestra has a broad repertory, performing songs about wartime, dance, poetry and, last but not least, the unification of the country to achieve ultimate prosperity. The film is extremely self-conscious as a foreign export of propaganda for the wonders of traditional Chinese music.</p>\n<p>We are introduced to the Bian Zhong (编钟) as the “eighth wonder of the world.” Its 55 different sized bells, with the biggest weighing 203 kg and the smallest at 2.4 kg. The bells are inscribed with 2400 characters listing the different scales, whose seven note scale system is the same as the contemporary system.</p>\n<p>Despite these revelations, many of the younger Chinese people call it  &#8220;junk&#8221; and &#8220;useless relics&#8221;. The daughter of the historian introducing the Bian Zhong expresses her dissallusionment with contemporary Chinese attitudes toward their own culture. &#8220;The Bian Zhong is a symbol of our ancient culture. I don&#8217;t understand how they would think things like that&#8221;, she whines.</p>\n<p>Presumably speaking out as the mouthpiece of the state, the father blames these negative attitudes to Chinese culture on the Cultural Revolution. &#8220;The ten years of chaos caused a great gap in peoples education.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These direct English translation comes across rather stale. For example, during this conversation between daughter and father, Xia ying says:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, father, I was thinking we could invent some new music for the Bian Zhong.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Hey, that sounds like a very good idea! Why don&#8217;t you tell me about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This eventually leads them to incorporate contemporary methods into the musical tradition of the Bian Zhong in order to draw popular attention to traditional Chinese music. They then reproduce a Bian Zhong according to an original antique and set out on a journey of rediscovery, covering half of China in search of  ancient artifacts to act as data and reference materials to use for their upcoming shows.</p>\n<p>Watching how the modern Chinese interpret ancient lifestyle is the most interesting facet of the film. The dance movements, for instance, are often developed from the symbolism of the total submission of the slaves to the aristocratic class.

He then goes about breaking up pieces of bread to put in the cage bowl, urging the invisible pet to eat up.</p>\n<p>Chen chen continues to experience difficulties in adjusting to his mother, but grandfather realises his dilemma, that he needs to leave in order to avoid the two of them becoming too reliant upon each other. He decides to go. When he asks his mother where grandpa went Chenchen accuses her of driving him away. He tears up the place and runs off to find his grandfather and, bursting into tears, pounds against his door. Later the two celebrate grandpa&#8217;s birthday by going out and flying kites. His daughter bakes him a huge delicious cake, and when she has come back out with a blanket for him she realises he&#8217;s dead.</p>\n<p>She does not tell Chen Chen and they celebrate his birthday with the lighting of hundreds of red candles which fill the room. This cinematic gesture of the red candles was extremely interesting from the point of view of a maternal force using deception in order to joyfully memorialise a powerful bygone influence. Above the red candles is a classic Communist Era family photo portrait of their grandpa and grandmother. This is in some respects a symbolic gesture to say that with the passing of the grandpa&#8217;s generation is the passing of that chapter of China&#8217;s history and a step toward an embrace of the new.</p>\n<p>The film is quite slow.<br />\n(1 star - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:28:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grandparents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Parenthood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Parenting", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2650828, "name": "Wang Junzheng", "creator_id": 82433, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357995", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650831, "name": "Liu Fang", "creator_id": 82436, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315687", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650827, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q10873948", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2650833, "name": "Li Ding", "creator_id": 82438, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315457", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650832, "name": "Shi Chen", "creator_id": 82437, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035433", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650834, "name": "Xiao Xiong", "creator_id": 82439, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223456", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650830, "name": "Yan Junsheng", "creator_id": 82435, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315291", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650835, "name": "Zhang Qianyi", "creator_id": 82440, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360719", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2650829, "name": "He Guofu", "creator_id": 82434, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146415", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [55263]}, {"id": 115768, "acmi_id": "Z000026", "title": "Call of the home village = Xiang qing", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "call-of-the-home-village-xiang-qing", "creator_credit": "Bingliu Hu, Jin Wang, Li Bangjin and Pearl River Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Qiuyue’s adopted son, Tiangui is going to marry her daughter, Cuicui.

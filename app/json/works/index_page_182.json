came to Chiltern in 1950. And in the famous &#8216;54 Grand Final, I was the center half forward. The next year, we made the Grand Final and lost to Greta after 43 minutes elapsed in the last quarter. That sounds unbelievable, but it&#8217;s a fact.</p>\n<p>[CLOCK TICKING]</p>\n<p>KEVIN MAYHEW:  At three-quarter time, we held a fairly comfortable lead. However, something happened in the timekeeper&#8217;s box.

And as legend would have it, at the end of full time, the Swans were actually in front on the scoreboard. The siren didn&#8217;t sound at the end of full time. It actually went into overtime. And at the end of time on, Chiltern were still in front on the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>[CLOCK TICKING]</p>\n<p>DON STEPHENSON: My immediate oponent, Ernie Ford, said to me around that time, he said, well, you&#8217;ve done us to a bloody frazzle Don, so good on you. And we just kept going, and I laughed, and I said, oh, it&#8217;s going to go any second. But it just failed to go.</p>\n<p>After 35 minutes, cars were leaving the ground in droves and we were four goals in front. And I blame ourselves, up to a point. I think we sort of relaxed, thinking the game was won.</p>\n<p>And one bloke by the name of Gordon Byron drove into Wangaratta, through he&#8217;d switch on the wireless and see what the final score was. And to his amazement, the game was still going. Which he couldn&#8217;t believe.

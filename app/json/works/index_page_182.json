The story of Cuban poet and writer Reinaldo Arenas, the screenplay is based on Arenas&#8217; memoirs. The film opens with Arenas&#8217; idyllic, if impoverished youth - brought up by his adoring mother and a dictatorial father who forbade his son&#8217;s poetry. A shift to the city exposes Arenas to urban influences and his teachers encourage his artistic expression. Openly gay and politically active, the adult Arenas finds himself persecuted by the Castro regime and his writing is smuggled to France in order to be published. Javier Bardem plays Arenas as a passionate, talented hedonist whose attempts to escape incarceration are both daring and foolhardy. The cinematography depicts Cuba as a magical and beautiful place, saturated in decaying splendour, which is crippled by corruption and state sanctioned police brutality. Schnabel employs an episodic structure to relay the key moments of Arenas&#8217; life.

He soon realises to stay in this new world with high-powered corporate espionage player Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) he must break a few rules. Gekko represents one of three father figures for Fox, the other two being his real father and his boss at the broking firm, all of whom give him constant advice. However, Fox&#8217;s overwhelming desire for gold cufflinks and brick-like cellular phones steer him down the path of corruption and greed and he soon realises the price of the pursuit of overnight success.

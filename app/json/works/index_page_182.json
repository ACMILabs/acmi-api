One night while on duty Mad Dog inadvertently saves the life of local gangster and part time comedian Frank Milo (a dour Bill Murray, cast against type). Under guidance from his therapist and eager to bring happiness to the life of someone who empathises with his desire to be someone else, Milo befriends Mad Dog and loans Glory (Thurman) to him for a week. Before the week is over Mad Dog and Glory have fallen in love and the two are faced with settling Glory&#8217;s brother&#8217;s gambling debt to Milo in exchange for their relationship. Cast also includes David Caruso and Mike Star as convincingly menancing sidekick heavyweights and Kathy Baker as Mad Dog&#8217;s neighbour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "Hungarian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photographers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Extortion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Conjugal violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Comedians", "People&nbsp;→ Comedians", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mad-dog-and-glory", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961470, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961471, "name": "Barbara de Fina", "creator_id": 23666, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961472, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "creator_id": 3485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961473, "name": "John McNaughton", "creator_id": 69837, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961469, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

It shows the life of sea coast Aborigines at Yirrkala in the north-eastern corner of Arnhem Land. Demonstrates how, as children, they learn to handle canoes made from bark and as adults how they use them for fishing and hunting turtle. Shows how the canoes are made by stripping bark from a tree. The women of the tribe do the camp chores, collect firewood, make string bags, hunt goannas, and search for food plants.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Hunting", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Northern Territory", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social life and customs", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Arnhem Land (N.T.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Arnhem Land (N.T.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Exploring expeditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Yirrkala (N.T)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - Exploring expeditions", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Canoes and canoeing", "Places&nbsp;→ Arnhem Land (N.T.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Yirrkala (N.T)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1313160, "name": "Charles P.

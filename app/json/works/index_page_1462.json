We are told that: The grave was built in 1884 and was preserved by the Cultural Relics Bureau of Guangxi.  A year after he received this honour, he was assassinated by the Taiping society.</p>\n<p>20 years after the failure of the Taiping Movement, a member of the Tai Ping Society, Huang Chang betrayed the pact and sided with the Qing Court instead.  The Qing Court bestowed the title of PingNan General after he treacherously betrayed the Tai Ping Society.  Everyone within the Guangxi district was outraged by his betrayal.  On the Iron Chain Bridge, Yang Fei (the second in command of Tai Ping society) was captured after he fell for the plot created by the Qing government while attempting to assassinate Huang Chang.  In another occasion, while Huang was watching the dance of Yao Jia girls, the lead dancer mingled into the group and attempted to find an opportunity to murder Huang.  Both assassinators died heroically under the brutal hands of the Qing Government.</p>\n<p>Huang feared for his life and ordered the murder of anyone who is suspected of being involved with the Tai Ping Society in Guang Xi.  Huang’s atrocious acts created even more public outrage and social unrest within the Tai Ping Society and members sworn that no matter what it takes, they will never rest until Huang is lying in his grave.  The Chief of Taiping Society knew that none in the society is a match for the cunning Huang, so he tries to find the help of the iterant master—the Lonely Murderer.  Not without some difficulty, the Lonely Murderer finally listens to the Chief’s pleas and leaves the mountain to embark on the dangerous mission.</p>\n<p>The Tai Ping Society hears that Huang is going to Ma Jia for his mother’s birthday but before the mission started, the messenger who was in charge of passing information to the Murderer, was arrested by the Qing court.  Tai Ping Society’s plan was revealed and the Murderer’s expedition was off to a rocky start.  The Murderer was ambushed many times—on the road, in the mountains and in the bushes.  Death was nearly knocking at his door on one occasion but he was fortunately saved by a beautiful woman, Kanai.</p>\n<p>One day, while Kanai was trying to find the Murderer, she met Hong, a girl working for the Tai Ping Society. Hong fights Kanai, knowing that Kanai is actually the daughter of Master Qin—a high official of the Qing’s Court.  Kanai is an assassin sent from the Court to kill the Murderer.  On the other hand, Hong was ordered to stay close to Yang Gang who is the Henchman and close guard of Huang Chang; Hong was responsible for learning the plans of the Qing court.  However, Hong was killed during her fight with Kanai.</p>\n<p>One time, while the Murderer was injured, Kanai cleaned his wound and tries to kill him; but before she could make her move, the Murderer told her a story.  After hearing the story, Kanai cried uncontrollably on the Murderer’s shoulder.  The story revealed that her father was actually killed by the Qing army when the army advanced on the Tai Ping Capital.  Her mother was found by Qin Mu who tried to possess her. She wouldn’t submit to him and took her life. Subsequently, Qin adopted Kanai and made her his daughter. After knowing about her real identity, Kanai is determined to help the Murderer escape from Qin’s traps.</p>\n<p>During the birthday celebration for Huang’s mother in Ma Jia, all Qing imperial officials present gifts and blessings on stage for Huang’s mother.  An old official steps forth and presents a present covered under a cloth. When Huang unveils it, a small tombstone with the words “The Grave of Huang Zhang” engraved on it.  The Chief of the Tai Ping Society tries to kill Huang with his sword but was unsuccessful as Yang came to Huang’s rescue.  Huang tries to run away while the crowd became hysterical, but the Murderer stops him in his tracks at the drum tower.   The Murderer pierced three poisonous needles on the throat of Huang and he falls dead to the ground.  The Murderer attempts to escape after completing his mission but Qin and his army follows closely.  In the heat of the battle, the Chief of Tai Ping Society dies heroically, and Kanai also appears just in time to save the Murderer.  However, while Kanai comes to the Murderer’s rescue, she was stabbed by a sword and was killed.  The Lonely Murderer is left alone again. He cries out in anger and carries the limp Kanai into the sunset.</p>\n<p>Cultural History:<br />\nIn 1980s, the film industry in China encountered hard times because popular thriller and martial arts films had a difficult time getting screened under the discreet eyes of authorities who felt that such ‘exciting’ films were socially unacceptable.  In addition, the rising competition of other forms of entertainment also stole the attention of Chinese crowds away from films.  However, the development of English dubbed Chinese films as well as Chinese dubbed foreign films stimulated the growth of the Chinese film industry in local and global ways.</p>\n<p>The use of English dubbing reflects the fact that this Chinese film was subject to foreign distribution in the year it was released.

And although there is a consistent sense of optimism about the China of today, the issues faced reflect an unseen dark side of society.<br />\nStill, Anran seems unable to ignore the ubiquitous warning signs of a latent hostility within society which reveals itself whenever an unspoken rule is transgressed. Even the trees seem to have &#8220;eyes&#8221; popping out of them. Though she recognises all the different moods of each eye, she feels each of the eyes are watching her.

It is a re-adaptation from a novel of the same name published in1981, in which the Director and screenwriter try to expose the life of peasant farmers during a time of transition from the old, Communistic China, to a &#8216;new&#8217; China which breaks from the discreet eye of the Communist government.  The film reflects the hardships, demeaning experiences and environments of peasantry farmers, as well as general society views at the time. Naturally, as the moniker suggests, this film is about life, but simultaneously it is also very much about love.</p>\n<p>This film is a story which unravels from a woman&#8217;s unrequited love for a man.  After graduating from High school, the young male protagonist Gao Jialin had the hopes of working as a teacher in a primary school in the city.  However, his dream was shattered when the opportunity was directly given to the son of a cadre.  Gao was forced to return to the countryside to earn a living with his parents as lowly peasant farmers and this abrupt fall down the social ladder plagued him every day.  He was constantly in denial about his peasantry life until an illiterate, country girl Liu Qiaozhen attempts to open his eyes to see the beauty of the country folks and their country life.  Liu secretly admirs Gao, and often tries to go out of her way to help him.  She unreservedly and persistently reveals her love for Gao and eventually captures Gao&#8217;s heart; even changing his attitude towards country life.</p>\n<p>As time progress, the couple work together to raise awareness about health and hygiene in the country, looked after well water, gradually changing the country to become more civilized in small ways. However, although Gao finds that little positive changes have occurred, he still couldn&#8217;t abandon the thought of working in the city because his interest is still deeply rooted in writing literature. When Gao&#8217;s uncle changes his job and becomes the Regional Labour Secretary, without much thought, Gao grasps at the opportunity to break away from his lowly country life.  Subsequently, Gao&#8217;s old classmate and secret admirer Huang Yaping tries to help Gao secure a job as a journalist in the city.</p>\n<p>Liu was in depths of despair when Gao left for the city to work but they promised each other that they will remain faithful to one another.  However, Gao is tempted by the glitter and gold of living in the city and ultimately breaks up with Liu—choosing to develop his career over love.  Liu was left heartbroken and was soon married off to a man who had a crush on her from another village.</p>\n<p>Gao learns about Liu&#8217;s fate but was convinced by Huang, who despite already having a boyfriend, that he can have a brighter future in her company because she is educated and is brought up in a family of higher social class. As Gao starts to think that his dream is within reach; believing that he can lead a new and better life away from the country, Life tells him otherwise.  His life plummets immediately when the mother of Huang&#8217;s ex-boyfriend reports him to high authorities about the improper procedures Gao used to obtain his job position in the city.

The Chinese awoke to discover they were slaves&#8221;. He wonders why his wife is interested in state affairs.</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin tells her friend Zhiying that she has decided to go to Japan.

Her friend attempts to understand how a woman as delicate as Qiu Jin could be so passionate about politics.</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin prepares to leave, leaving her children with their grandparents. After an emotional goodbye, she arrives in Japan. She is greeted by Xiu Xilin, a revolutionary friend of hers from Shanghai. Qiu Jin settles into her new life in Japan, joining every revolutionary organisation, attending all the revolutionary rallies and even changing her name to Jing Xiong. Qiu Jin implores Xiu Xilin to join the alliance, and they discuss Sun Yat-Sen&#8217;s recent speech and the possibility of imminent revolution. Qiu Jin, we learn, believes in a unified China.</p>\n<p>They organise a hiking trip for the weekend, where Qiu Jin can meet the elusive Tianhua, a revolutionary writer who is having difficulty &#8216;enlightening the people&#8217;.

Qiu Jin resents that she is the only woman in the group, and that they other don&#8217;t understand the struggles of women.</p>\n<p>The Japanese make it increasingly difficult for Chinese people to live abroad, dismissing Chinese students. Tianhua tells the students, who are enraged by the new rules and quarrel amongst themselves, that if China itself cannot act as one, how can it be expected to stand up against the rest of the world?

Images of entraptured audience members are interspersed with shots of Hua’s extraordinary performance. One woman in the crowd is so entranced that she chews the corner of her handkerchief. Others, like Ma the Bold, watch with lustful intentions. When he visits backstage he offers Hua a special reward, drinks with him after the performance. Hua politely evades Ma’s advances and retreats behind a curtain to change. Ma peers through the curtain, telling her that he has paid and expects favours in return. When Hua’s husband Jin Lingtong tells Ma that they sell their art, but not their bodies, Ma redirects his derision, insisting that Jin must perform songs at his request. Jin does this until he collapses from exhaustion, blood trickling from his lips. When he dies onstage, Ma announces, “Well done, light the fire crackers”.</p>\n<p>During the funeral ceremony at Sacrifice Rock, the distraught Hua buries a silk scarf embroidered with the words “I wish I could go with you” into her husband’s grave. However, even amid the distress, the threat of Ma the Bold remains and escalates when Mr Yue expresses his interest in her as well. Yi has a plan. He tells both men that the person who retrieves the scarf from the grave at Sacrifice Rock will be rewarded with Hua’s hand. The evil Fifth Lord, Ma the Bold, takes a lantern and travels to the grave in the dead of night. Once there, he is surrounded by spirits of Sacrifice Rock, one of which attacks him with each blow transforming the design on his face. During the struggle Ma the Bold balances precariously at the edge of a rocky cliff and eventually falls to his death. The film ends on a beach with Yi in hand to hand combat with Mr Yue. Each throws large clay pots at one another, they collide and smash in the air. Eventually Mr Yue responds to Yi’s ultimate blow by falling backwards and collapsing into the ocean. Yi is left to wander the land.</p>\n<p>With music  by Tian Feng, Chen Zhimei, performed by the Emei Film Studio Orchestra conducted by Ziong Jihua.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas, Chinese", "Performance&nbsp;→ Opera  -  Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651167, "name": "Yang Gaisen", "creator_id": 82700, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144282", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651168, "name": "Zhang Lukun", "creator_id": 82701, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222654", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651166, "name": "Dong Zhicheng", "creator_id": 82699, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035242", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651165, "name": "Emei Film Studio", "creator_id": 82698, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q81875801", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651170, "name": "Nan Guo", "creator_id": 82703, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091419", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651169, "name": "Wei Minglun", "creator_id": 82702, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126008", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651176, "name": "Guan Zongzia", "creator_id": 82708, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299334", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651175, "name": "Liu Jian", "creator_id": 82707, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357539", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651177, "name": "Yan Bide", "creator_id": 82709, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223026", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651173, "name": "Zhang Xianheng", "creator_id": 82706, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357517", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651174, "name": "Zhu Lin", "creator_id": 82689, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q9193203", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651171, "name": "Cheng Zhaoxun", "creator_id": 82704, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337667", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651172, "name": "You Zongshu", "creator_id": 82705, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126269", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146456", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [55302]}, {"id": 115807, "acmi_id": "Z000068", "title": "Devoted to the blue sky = Hun xi lan tian", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "devoted-to-the-blue-sky-hun-xi-lan-tian", "creator_credit": "Yu Benzheng, Ying Huiqian and Shanghai Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Fang Jie is the Chief of The Office of Engineering, which is responsible for the design of a new jetfighter called &#8216;Blue Sky&#8217;.

Director Yuan urged his former classmate engineer Chen Qiming to develop their own welding rods as soon as possible. Ms Zhu Hui, also a former classmate of Yuan, is assigned to be the general supervisor of the ship project. But Zhu refused to accept the offer as she learned that the marine surveyor was her ex boyfriend, Feng who left her as she refused to go abroad with him years ago. Yuan persuaded Zhu to take the job and brought about reforms to the ship plant, which was controversial and severely criticized by some senior workers, including Yuan’s own father. Yuan convinced his colleagues with reason and won their support. At the same time, the Shipyard is able to produce the welding rods with Chen’s research breakthrough. As the ship project comes to an end, Feng is approached by a foreign company who wants Feng to create some trouble for Hanchun Shipyard. Feng refused the bribery and finished his task.

A young working couple is passionate and cheerful, but their lack of education and manners reflect their life with capricious mood swings and constant arguments. The director&#8217;s wife is gentle and kindhearted, and even though the family is full of gentle warmth, their life is often plain and tasteless, leading them to question their passion for each other. The artist couple suffers from repression, one is often silent and uncommunicative, the other is narrow-minded and often filled with jealousy; the arrival of a young female art student commences a period of uncertain instability of their everyday life, however it also triggers them to reveal their inner passion for each other. A couple with an appreciable age gap is under distress from disharmonious sexual life, though after self-adjustments, the couple restores their satisfactory domesticity.

Leng Yun, a school teacher, could not bear her husband who worked for the Japanese, and went to join an anti-Japanese troop. Leng and seven other girls in the troop established good friendship. As winter came, the troop camped on a river bank but was attacked by the Japanese one night. In order to cover the troop to break through the siege, the eight girls fought alone with the Japanese until all their ammunition was used up. The Japanese had wanted to capture them alive, but the eight girls, with the eldest only twenty five and the youngest only thirteen years old, would rather die than surrender. They went hand in hand into the cold river in the end.</p>\n<p>China’s state-owned film studios have produced many military films about the anti-Japanese war, and this is one of them. The military films mainly aim at patriotic education. Anti-Japanese films have become a sub-genre of war films in Chinese cinema.<br />\nEstablished on August 1, 1952, August First Film Studio is located in Beijing and under the management of the Chinese army.

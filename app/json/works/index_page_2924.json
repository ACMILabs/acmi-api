Alan is determined to ride his pony Katie again, however his father forbids it, as he says there is too great a chance of Alan getting hurt or killed, as his legs are no longer strong enough to grip the horse and he has trouble maintaining his balance. At school, Alan overhears a classmate complaining about exercising his pony at lunchtime, and quickly volunteers to do it, despite his father&#8217;s warnings. Although his riding is belittled by his school teacher, who tells him to focus on learning, as he is destined for a desk job, Alan continues, and eventually shows his father what he can do.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television serials", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television serials - Australia", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Horses", "Biographical", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors, Australian", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature, Australian", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Marshall, Alan, 1902-1984", "Literature&nbsp;→ Writing", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Marshall, Alan, 1902-1984", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television serials", "Television&nbsp;→ Television serials&nbsp;→ Television serials - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815936, "name": "John Gauci", "creator_id": 78414, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809019, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809021, "name": "Kevin Dobson", "creator_id": 22385, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q13435404", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 809018, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49007", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31119], "external_references": []}]}

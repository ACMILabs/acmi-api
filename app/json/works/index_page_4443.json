The Mint was opened in 1872 and became a Registry of Civil Marriages in the 1970s. We see the Renaissance Revival architecture and surrounding buildings, as well as the coat of arms.</p>\n<p>Guests arrive and greet each other outside the registry. Inside we see the wedding cake, guests enjoying themselves and the hospitality arrangement at the reception.</p>\n<p>Originally made on 8mm film</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:01:41:00 Maurie and son deck side</p>\n<p>00:01:47:00 Boy on a Dragster Bicycle with vintage cars parked alongside.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:25:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Cruise ships", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 984865, "name": "Maurie Fields", "creator_id": 83488, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 984866, "name": "Val Jellay", "creator_id": 84852, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "174951", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1960s-1970s", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1960s-1970s"}], "labels": [57751]}, {"id": 118247, "acmi_id": "B2003911", "title": "[Maurie Fields and Val Jellay Home Movies: Reel 11]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maurie-fields-and-val-jellay-home-movies-reel-11", "creator_credit": "Maurie Fields and Val Jellay", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia and Thailand, c. 1960s-1970s", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>This film is a snapshot of a family holiday in Thailand.</p>\n<p>The film has the occasional hair in the gate and some rough hand-held techniques.</p>\n<p>The film opens with street scenes somewhere in Thailand.

There are good closeups of the children, reflecting examples of children’s fashion and hairstyles of the era.</p>\n<p>We see the children venture out to the edge of the water and then play along the top of the seawall.

Tricycles, a blow-up wading pool with the backyard hose leading into it, swings and a sand pit create a great snapshot of children’s recreation, toys, and equipment particular to the era. We also see a young boy kicking what appears to be an American shaped football and two boys playing with toy cars and a toy police car.</p>\n<p>The fifth section of the film shows a young baby being held by her mother.

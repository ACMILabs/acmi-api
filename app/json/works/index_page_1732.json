The film features an array of exaggerated types (repressed sexual deviants, wry octogenarians, duplicitous friends) to draw laughs as it places Neil in increasingly farcical scenarios. Cast includes Michael Praed, Michele Winstanley, Kate Byers, Sarah Winman, David Kossoff and Helena McCarthy.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Neil Price (Clunes), a children&#8217;s toy salesman, is preparing to marry an upper crust girl named Hilary, despite the disapproval of her snobbish mother. Three days before the nuptials, on the night of his stag party, Neil has his drink spiked by best friend Gary, and is left stranded naked on a remote Scottish island. Neil has to somehow make his way back to London for his wedding, aided by the kindness of strangers. Naturally Neil falls into all manner of strife en route - he&#8217;s arrested, has an arm broken, survives an armed robbery, and steals several cars. Meanwhile in Neil&#8217;s mysterious absence, Gary and Hilary&#8217;s mother go to work on her so that she will marry Gary instead of Neil on her wedding day. This romantic comedy places the rubbery-faced Clunes (from TV&#8217;s Men behaving badly) in all kind of sticky situations as well as pairing him opposite the comely Carmen (Anna Chancellor), who assists Neil in his quest (and provides an alternate love interest). The film features an array of exaggerated types (repressed sexual deviants, wry octogenarians, duplicitous friends) to draw laughs as it places Neil in increasingly farcical scenarios.

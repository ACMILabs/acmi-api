This team consisted of Christie Skelton (18 years old), Angie Ballard (16 years old), Holly Ladmore (14 years old) and of course, Louise. David Goldie takes us into the lives of these four young women, two who were born with their handicap and two who became paraplegics through the tragic consequences of car accidents. His sensitive interviews with the girls and their families gives an insight to the focus and determination and the wonderful spirit in each of them, individually, and as a team. Louise, Holly, Christie and Angie are seen in training three weeks before the 1998 IPC Disability World Athletics Championship being held at Birmingham, England. Each has to compete in an individual event but it is the relay which unites and motivates them as a team. Introduced and narrated by David Goldie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - Australia", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Handicapped - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Paraplegics", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Physically handicapped", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sports for the physically handicapped", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Wheelchairs", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Athletes - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports for the physically handicapped", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Wheelchair sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Women athletes", "People&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2064850, "name": "David Goldie", "creator_id": 24865, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064849, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064846, "name": "Spirit 2000 Productions", "creator_id": 79589, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2064845, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48948", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [31061], "external_references": []}]}

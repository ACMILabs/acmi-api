Episode 4-SLAUGHTER, the battles of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele were three of the worst of the war, yet soldiers sought to keep their sanity with music, sport and theatre. Episode 5-MUTINY, by the start of 1917, the strain of war was affecting people on the home and battle fronts. Half of the French army mutinied. Episode 6- COLLAPSE, Germany&#8217;s war effort collapsed in 1918. Episode 7-LEGACY, the end of WW1 did little to relieve suffering across Europe. Four empires collapsed and large parts of the continent were devastated. The Peace Treaty of Versailles did nothing to ease the suffering of either the conquered or victorious people, and the seeds were sown for a second war. This was a war of attrition of men, machines and ideals. The futility of losing a generation of 9 million men who never came home, from a war many didn&#8217;t understand. National honour, fervour, and man&#8217;s greed to expand borders and dominate others led to a society which was torn asunder and would never be the same again. It affected and influenced art, music, literature and changed the history for the rest of the 20th Century.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Versailles (France)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - Environmental aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War and society", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War memorials", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Participation, Australian", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Peace", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ War - Environmental aspects", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Participation, Australian", "History&nbsp;→ World history - 20th century", "Places&nbsp;→ Versailles (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2064041, "name": "Margaret Koval", "creator_id": 28779, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064036, "name": "Imperial War Museum (Great Britain)", "creator_id": 28778, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064032, "name": "BBC-TV", "creator_id": 11912, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064029, "name": "KCET (Television station : Los Angeles, Calif.)", "creator_id": 17999, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2064025, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115509, "acmi_id": "S01331", "title": "1914 - 1918 The Great War and the Shaping of a Century", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "1914-1918-the-great-war-and-the-shaping-of-a-century", "creator_credit": "Carol Sennett, Carl Byker and BBC", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 86817, "acmi_id": "308520", "title": "1914-1918 : explosion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "1914-1918-explosion", "creator_credit": "Margaret Koval, Imperial War Museum (Great Britain), BBC-TV and KCET (Television station : Los Angeles, Calif.)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43054", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26308], "external_references": []}]}

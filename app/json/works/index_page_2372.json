What transpires is a thriller entailing conspiracy theories, double-crossings, a corrupt government and murder. &#8220;Sneakers&#8221; is quite amusing and, at times, somewhat fraught with tension, as the team battle a myriad of forces. Pre-dating the late 1990s, early 2000s paranoid computer-hacker films, &#8220;Sneakers&#8221; has a sprightliness that impresses and despite an overabundance of contrivances, makes for a satisfying caper. Top cast includes Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Ben Kingsley, Dan Ackroyd, Mary McDonnell, River Phoenix and David Strathairn.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Computer crimes", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/sneakers", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2304317, "name": "Phil Alden Robinson", "creator_id": 31331, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1387617", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304307, "name": "Lawrence Lasker", "creator_id": 52976, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q115990", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304310, "name": "Lindsley Lindsley Parsons", "creator_id": 80659, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271297", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304308, "name": "Walter Parkes", "creator_id": 78189, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1971768", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304306, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2304299, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51989", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [33626]}, {"id": 94119, "acmi_id": "317896", "title": "Wolf", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wolf-dvd", "creator_credit": "Mike Nichols, Douglas Wick and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47866, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q930540"}], "brief_description": "<p>Publisher Will Randall - recently retrenched and replaced by younger, sycophant protegee Stewart (James Spader) - notices strange behaviour after a wolf at full moon bites him.

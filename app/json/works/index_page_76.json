With beautiful photography by G.R. Aldo and narration by Visconti and Antonio Pietrangeli. Won the Special Prize in the 1948 Venice Film Festival. Franco Zeffirelli worked as an assitant director. In Italian with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Italian"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/la-terra-trema", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954757, "name": "Universalia Film", "creator_id": 28032, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954758, "name": "Salvo D'Angelo", "creator_id": 28033, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954759, "name": "Luchino Visconti", "creator_id": 23064, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42071", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1948", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1948"}], "labels": [25496], "external_references": [{"id": 5790, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "43445"}]}, {"id": 93981, "acmi_id": "317741", "title": "The Eagle has landed [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-eagle-has-landed-widescreen", "creator_credit": "ITC Entertainment, Jack Wiener, David Niven Jr and John Sturges", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A Colonel with the Luftwaffe, imprisoned for striking a fellow officer, is offered a lifeline when Nazi Colonel Radl (Robert Duvall) asks him to lead a daring suicide mission to kidnap Winston Churchill.

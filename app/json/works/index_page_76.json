They include dealing with the suspicions of his intelligent Catholic wife, Carmella (Edie Falco); the traumas of seeing his daughter, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), leave adolescence behind and prepare for College; and his concerns with his slacker son, Anthony Junior (Robert Iler). On top of this he has to deal with the constant undermining by his tough-bitch mother (Nancy Marchand) and the wheeling and dealing of his uncle, Junior (Dominic Chianese). Its only when he is with his &#8220;boys&#8221;, the &#8220;capos&#8221; that form his Mafia Crew - Paulie (Tony Sirico), Christopher (Michael Imperioli) and Silvio (Steven Van Zandt) - that Tony can relax. But even then, business always intrudes &#8230; With a consistently brilliant cast, tough and witty writing and a complex examination of materialism and contemporary American society, &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; manages to create an ambiguous moral epic out of its study of power, corruption and money. Violent and uncompromising, the series delivers a narrative sweep that has the breadth of the classical nineteenth century novel but its language, vision and cynicism plants it firmly in the twenty-first. Created by David Chase and featuring direction by noted independent directors such as Nick Gomez, &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; deserves the acclaim heaped upon it. In its moral complexity, insight and daring it leaves the products of the Hollywood motion picture industry for dead.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["13:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Emmy Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in television", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Depression, Mental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3086452, "name": "Alan Taylor", "creator_id": 80741, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1113146", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086450, "name": "Allen Coulter", "creator_id": 80740, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q423052", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086458, "name": "Andy Wolk", "creator_id": 80744, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4761509", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086444, "name": "Daniel Attias", "creator_id": 80738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086442, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381982", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086448, "name": "John Patterson", "creator_id": 75124, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1794153", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086454, "name": "Lorraine Senna", "creator_id": 80742, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1870399", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086459, "name": "Matthew Penn", "creator_id": 80745, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6791068", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086446, "name": "Nick Gomez", "creator_id": 80739, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3339752", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086456, "name": "Tim Van Patten", "creator_id": 80743, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q713066", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086440, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381982", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086438, "name": "Ilene Landress", "creator_id": 36246, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086435, "name": "Brillstein-Grey Entertainment", "creator_id": 36244, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086436, "name": "Chase Films", "creator_id": 36245, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086433, "name": "Home Box Office", "creator_id": 22860, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 3086431, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

Kidnapped by Uncle Buddy, on his way to be saved from the devil by being baptised, a young 11 year-old boy gets a life education on exactly what it is he is going to be &#8216;saved&#8217; from. Through a re-telling of this young boy&#8217;s journey travelling the Deep South, his education becomes the viewers&#8217; with a narration (by Carl Lumbly) of the boy as an adult recalling this past he will never forget. The history of the African American musician is his lesson, starting out in New Orleans and the blues music that stemmed from early 1900 to the 1940s turns into, as the director says, a &#8216;story that gives you the impression of the blues&#8217;. Inserted in the &#8216;educational&#8217; narrative is a combination of archival footage of the period, original performances and stills. The influence of the church and gospel music is covered and the work also includes details of female performers whose powerful music and voices transcend time and place, such as Bessie Smith, Victoria Spivey, Ma Rainey, Dinah Washington and Sister Rosetta Thorpe. Others featured include Willie Dixon, Sonny Boy Williamson, Son House, John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters amongst many others. Cast includes Tommy Redmond Hicks and Nathaniel Lee Jr. with an original score by Stephen James Taylor.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

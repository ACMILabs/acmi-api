The devastating Second World War conflict which was instigated by Germany&#8217;s invasion of the Soviet Union left over 30 million dead, 15 million of which were civilians. Combining archival footage and first hand accounts, this engrossing documentary traces Germany&#8217;s initial victorious invasion and their ultimate defeat at Stalingrad. Although the soldier&#8217;s of the Soviet army had a life expectancy of 24 hours, the most devastating consequences of the war were exacted upon the Soviet citizens. Not only did they have to deal with the brutality of Hitler, who ordered the burning of countless villages across Russia, but their own tyrannical leader Stalin, who bore down swift retribution on anyone that defied him or the state.

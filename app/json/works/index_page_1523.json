Set in 1960s Baltimore, BB Bakowsky (Richard Dreyfus) and Ernest Tilley (Danny De Vito) are rival aluminium siding salesmen brought together through an unfortunate car accident. Each blames the other and a full-on feud ensues. Revenge becomes a game and BB succeeds in making life even more complicated when in order to infuriate Tilley, he attempts to sleep with Tilley&#8217;s wife, Nora (Barbara Hershey) only to end up falling in love with her. Although the dialogue is fast and furious with many hilarious scenes there is sense of a darker sadder story underneath. Cast includes John Mahoney, Seymour Cassel, Jackie Gayle.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:52:05:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/tin-men", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2000929, "name": "Barry Levinson", "creator_id": 72109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000928, "name": "Mark Johnson", "creator_id": 72110, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1279758", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000927, "name": "Touchstone Pictures", "creator_id": 70084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53318", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [34762], "external_references": []}]}

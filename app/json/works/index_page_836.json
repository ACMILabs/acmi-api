This program focuses on Ireland and some of the Irish playwrights who gave birth to a new kind of theatre, one that had more substance than the 19th century Victorian melodrama and moralising society plays which were being performed in Britain, most significantly, at a time when Ireland was fighting for independence from British empirical connections. Richard Eyre discusses in great detail the influences and historical background of several Irish playwrights including William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Sean O&#8217;Casey, and J.M. Synge and the part these individuals played in the establishment of a national theatre and a national identity for Ireland. Yeats, Shaw and Wilde were all born in Dublin around the same time, but Shaw and Wilde very early on exiled themselves to England to make their fame and fortune through satirising the English high society. In contrast, against a background of political turmoil and tension, Yeats, in collaboration with Lady Augusta Gregory, conceived The Abbey Theatre which was to become Ireland&#8217;s national theatre and a stage for the works of Sean O&#8217;Casey and J.M.

During the last century, theatre was challenged by mass entertainment in the form of cinema, television and the internet. The one thing that has made theatre stand apart is its quality of being &#8220;live&#8221;, allowing an immediate interaction between actors and audience. In this program, Richard Eyre explores how theatre has survived and why it will continue to survive - from the influences of Antonin Artaud&#8217;s &#8220;theatre of cruelty&#8221;, to the commercial popular culture of the blockbuster musicals, to the experimental and avant-garde. He takes us into the 1980s and 90s through discussion, interviews and excerpts, analysing the commercialisation of theatre; the audience; the fusion of traditional theatre with multimedia technology such as robotics, puppetry and film; the construction and reconstruction of theatres, eg the National Theatre, the Olivier Theatre and the Globe Theatre.

The aftermath of WW II influenced the direction of theatre and allowed a whole new generation of playwrights the freedom to express their anger, their political allegiance, social realism and an attitude that you could do or say what you want on stage - theatre became the instrument of social change. However, it was first German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), then Irish born Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) who inspired the 1960s and 70s generation of playwrights. Brecht, a communist, was known as a &#8220;theorist about theatre&#8221; who challenged the traditional values of theatre creating experimental and revolutionary works around his theory of alienation, promoting a style of acting and staging that created a distancing effect. Samuel Beckett was the man of evocative language, his plays often shrouded in despair and bleakness, combined with a lacing of caustic humor and left-wing politics. Richard Eyre presents indepth biographical backgrounds of each of these playwrights, including excerpts from their plays &#8220;The Resistible rise of Arturo Ui&#8221; and &#8220;Galileo&#8221; (Brecht), and &#8220;Waiting for Godot&#8221; (Beckett). Also features playwrights Edward Bond, Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill, David Hare, Alan Bennett, Tom Stoppard and others along with film clips, excerpts and interviews. In addition, the program provides an historical overview of Britain during the 60s and 70s, the political and sexual freedom and the social mores of a society in the throes of a revolution - in fact, the whole world seemed to be in a state of protest in 1968. Follows through to the 1970s, to 1979 and the beginning of Thatcherism in Britain.

This is that series - consisting of six episodes exploring the very existence of theatre in today&#8217;s multi-media techno world. The question is asked whether the art of &#8220;live&#8221; performance can survive, an art which relies on the present tense, the here and now as it is being performed, where illusion can become reality and the audience can use its imagination and interaction with the performers on stage. &#8220;All aspects of our life are recorded&#8230;theatre is the most human of all art forms&#8221; (Richard Eyre). The first episode begins with William Shakespeare - his plays, his influence not only throughout Britain but world-wide, the theatres in which his plays have been performed over the centuries, and the many and varied adaptations of his writings on stage and in film, including excerpts from the films &#8220;Shakespeare in love&#8221; and &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221; and theatre productions &#8220;Othello&#8221; (Royal Shakespeare Company, 1999) and &#8220;Macbeth&#8221; (1979), proving Shakespeare&#8217;s longevity and adaptability to modern times. Richard Eyre is passionate about the subject of theatre and through his enthusiasm and entertaining anecdotes, excerpts, stills, archival footage and interviews with renowned actors, directors and playwrights including Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Baz Luhrmann, Tom Stoppard, Arthur Miller, Peter Brook, Peter Hall, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Laurence Olivier, among others, the viewer is given an insight and an appreciation of Britain&#8217;s national icon and best-known playwright. Contains some b&amp;w footage. Written and presented by Richard Eyre.

On 28 July 1976 a natural disaster - the worst ever recorded in China - killed over a quarter million people in the industrial city of Tang Shang, just 100km east of Beijing. An earthquake of massive proportions ripped the city apart destroying 96% of its buildings and burying alive over 600,000 people, all within 53 seconds.

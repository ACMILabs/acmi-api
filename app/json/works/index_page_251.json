The three sit down to enjoy a friendly drink when a man arrives and accuses Alphonse of the subway murder. &#8216;Buffet Froid&#8217; is a wonderfully absurd black comedy that cunningly reverses the conventions of the crime thriller to comment on the alienating and dehumanizing effects of contemporary urban life. Cast includes Gerard Depardieu, Bernard Blier, Jean Carmet, Genevieve Page, Michel Serrault, Carole Bouquet, Jean Rougerie, Bernard Crombey, Denise Gence, Jean Benguigui and Liliane Rovere.

This is a film about random violence and the focus of the movie is on the moral dilemma Marjorie faces, the depiction of graphic violence in the film is shocking at times, but a standout, harrowing performance by Farrah Fawcett makes it compulsive viewing.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Victims", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Victims", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Victims", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/extremities", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958364, "name": "Atlantic Entertainment", "creator_id": 31507, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958365, "name": "Thomas Coleman", "creator_id": 79176, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958366, "name": "George W.

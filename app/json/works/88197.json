MUSIC IN THE WOODS: Timothy and the special animals spend a day in the woods collecting feathers. As a precaution against any animals getting lost, they take their musical instruments to play if they get lost in the woods. In the woods they meet a new friend, the Parrot, but they soon realise that Little Mut is missing. THE ANIMAL GARDEN: The animals are given their own garden to look after by Timothy. Nothing seems to be growing, until Woeful and Gumpa decide to help things along. WOEFUL AND THE WASPBERRIES: The animals decide to organise a surprise birthday picnic for Timothy and they are all caught up in the preparations, except for Woeful who has forgotten all about Timothy&#8217;s birthday. Luckily he has an idea for a present, but it&#8217;s an idea that will lead him into all sorts of trouble. TIDYING TIMOTHY&#8217;S BEDROOM: When Timothy gets into trouble for having a messy bedroom, the animals decide to surprise him by tidying it themselves. There&#8217;s a prize for the first one to finish up, but there are even more surprises in store, especially for Timothy. GUMPA SOLVES A JIGSAW PUZZLE: Timothy and the animals are working on a jigsaw when Timothy is called in for tea. When they resume the puzzle after dinner, they discover a piece missing and the animals must perform a bit of detective work to find the missing piece.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Music in the woods: plus four other stories</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Cosgrove Hall Films, Jackie Cockle and Ellen Meske</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 1997</p>", "description": "<p>Episode number 2 of Series &#8220;The Animal shelf&#8221;.<br />\nFive stories are contained on this tape comprising MUSIC IN THE WOODS, THE ANIMAL GARDEN, WOEFUL AND THE WASPBERRIES, TIDYING TIMOTHY&#8217;S BEDROOM and GUMPA SOLVES A JIGSAW PUZZLE.

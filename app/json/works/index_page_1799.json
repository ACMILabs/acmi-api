Part of the appeal of Moretti&#8217;s film is his observation of the ordinariness of grief and the moments where it strikes, achieving true pathos and catharsis. Written, directed and starring Moretti, &#8220;The Son&#8217;s room&#8221; is a poignant and compassionate work that is effective and understated as it gently examines the difficulties inherent within mourning and death. Cast includes Nanni Moretti, Laura Morante, Silvio Orlando and Stefano Accorsi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Italy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Italy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Children - Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-sons-room", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999164, "name": "Nanni Moretti", "creator_id": 31031, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25100", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999162, "name": "Angelo Barbagallo", "creator_id": 79372, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2849447", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999163, "name": "Nanni Moretti", "creator_id": 31031, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25100", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999157, "name": "Bac Films (France)", "creator_id": 26575, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999158, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999159, "name": "Radiotelevisione Italiana", "creator_id": 15142, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035064", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999160, "name": "Sacher Film", "creator_id": 29488, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3460921", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999161, "name": "Telepiu", "creator_id": 36226, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999156, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

The children play on the deck, reading the book “Nursery Rhyme and Pastime Book” and what appears to be a selection of Little Golden Books. A young girl knits while sitting beside her siblings and two people prepare to ski beside the lodge wearing snow gear typical to the era.</p>\n<p>The second Part of the film is titled &#8220;NEDSA 1964”. The acronym stands for North-Eastern District Ski Association which was formed by ski clubs at Falls Creek and Hotham in 1937. Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era.

Also seen are some old style dingies, catamarans, Sabot and Mirror boats sailing, while the learn to sail on a sailboard. Moored speed boats are seen at Portsea, while people are swimming and children enjoying themselves on the shore.</p>\n<p>The second section of this film shows a family and friends event, which could be a children’s birthday party, being celebrated in a suburban back yard. There is very funny footage of children playing various party games including the Chocolate Game. This game involves participants rolling a dice, racing to dress up in a costume and then eating chocolate with a knife and fork. There is also a Dress Up Relay race. We see the children dash back and forth with costumes packed into a TEAL branded airline - style bag. The TEAL acronym may stand for Tasman Empire Airways Limited, which was the forerunner of Air New Zealand, established in 1940. The children unpack their costumes, dress up and then dash back to the next person in line, all the while keeping an eye on how fast their competition is going.</p>\n<p>There is an amusing sequence of children playing the Lifesaver Toothpick game. The first player in the line is given a lifesaver lolly to hold in their mouth with a toothpick, they then transfer the lifesaver to the next person holding a toothpick in their mouth without using their hands.</p>\n<p>There is some trampoline action and a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey. The Donkey in this instance appears to be called “Flowery”. There is also a balloon catching game played around an above ground backyard swimming pool, and Food on a String being played using chocolate, coconut covered snowballs strung from a monkey bar. The children try to eat them without using their hands.</p>\n<p>The film also shows children playing in the street with historical cars parked alongside them.

This dam could possibly be Rocky Valley Dam - a prime fly-fishing body of water just out of Falls Creek Victoria on the Omeo road. It is also sometimes referred to as Rocky Valley Lake and is the water storage dam for the Kiewa Valley, Victoria.

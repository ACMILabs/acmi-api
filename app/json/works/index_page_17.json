With the unwelcome mantle of ‘most locked-down city in the world’, Melbourne audiences were at the forefront of artist Laura Duffy’s mind when she created <i>Spawn</i>. Duffy mixes materials together like potions, encouraging audiences to consider texture through filmic spaces in which the natural and unnatural writhe upon one another – slipping, dripping, bubbling, congealing.</p>\n<p>Responsive to a context of global pandemic mixed in with climate crisis, Duffy is moved by sentiments of kindness and generosity, inviting audiences into the ‘poetic, fun, fresh, flowery, camp and flirty’ world of <i>Spawn</i>.</p>\n<p>The work reflects Duffy’s belief that materials are collaborative, complete with their own stories, histories and energies. The artist combines these materials to critique and shatter binary thinking of natural and unnatural as separate, instead embracing the complexity and blur of binaries. ‘How are we able to unleash from the constraints of “nature” to find new pleasures? A Post-nature embrace of all that is and will be, even if it&#8217;s toxic?’ Duffy questions.</p>\n<p><i>Spawn</i> is also a work about gratitude. A filmic study of death and transformation. As golden liquid pours over rotting, spinning fruits and flowers, Duffy encourages us to ‘say thank you and rejoice in transformation and transmutation.’</p>\n<p>– Serena Bentley, Curator, ACMI</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>&#8220;Spawn&#8221; is a single-channel video work co-commissioned by ACMI + CIRCUIT. &#8220;Spawn&#8221; explores political underpinnings of &#8216;natural&#8217; and &#8216;unnatural&#8217; in relation to bodies, exploring critically the process of bodies considered natural or normal.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Laura Duffy<br />\nACMI + CIRCUIT Commission<br />\nACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:04:35:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel video, colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1883610, "name": "Laura Duffy", "creator_id": 86132, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "187493", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2021", "notes": "", "to_year": "2021"}], "labels": [59212], "external_references": []}, {"id": 118044, "acmi_id": "Z000187", "title": "Delusional World", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "delusional-world", "creator_credit": "Mathew Spisbah and Lu Yang", "credit_line": "<p>Lu Yang, b.

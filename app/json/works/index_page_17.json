The gallery was run by John Reed, and was a precursor to the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Bulleen. The series of paintings had been commissioned by USP Benson to decorate the company’s new headquarters in South Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Later that year, Eidlitz received a Winston Churchill Fellowship and travelled to the United States, with the intention of studying with influential Hungarian-American artist Gyorgy Kepes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge.

Inspired by his introduction to new technology and experimental uses of photography and film in the US, as well as the teachings of Kepes, Eidlitz was one of the first artists to use computer graphics as a medium in Australia during the 1970s.

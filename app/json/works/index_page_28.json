Gladwell uses filmic devices such as slow-motion and long pans to capture both tightly choreographed and improvised performances by breakdancers, skateboarders and BMX bike riders in a combination of rural and city settings. The resulting works, which he describes as &#8220;performative landscapes&#8221; are both rhythmic and poetic - distorting speed, gravity, space and time; exploring visual and spatial paradoxes. He discusses his art practice and his collaboration with other performers and artists for this exhibition.

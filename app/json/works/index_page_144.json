The charm of the narrative is that it presents from a child&#8217;s perspective with uncomplicated views on life, unsullied by conjecture and misguided beliefs. The African village where this whimsical tale is set is abundant with colour, humour, culture and magic, with animation inspired by the earth colours and myths of Africa and imbued with a rich palette reminiscent of 19th century French painter Henri Rousseau. Music scored by Senegalese musician Youssou N&#8217;dour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa, West", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - Africa", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - France", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Myth", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fables", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Literature&nbsp;→ Myth", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa, West"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/kirikou-and-the-sorceress", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1977155, "name": "Michel Ocelot", "creator_id": 62138, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977154, "name": "Jacques Vercruyssen", "creator_id": 80910, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977153, "name": "Paul Thiltges", "creator_id": 80909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977152, "name": "Didier Brunner", "creator_id": 80908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977151, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977150, "name": "Monipoly Productions", "creator_id": 36673, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977149, "name": "Odec Kid Cartoons", "creator_id": 36672, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977148, "name": "Les Armateurs", "creator_id": 36671, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52614", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [34115], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94608, "acmi_id": "318565", "title": "Alphaville", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "alphaville", "creator_credit": "Jean-Luc Godard, Andre Michelin, Pathe Films and Athos Film", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1965", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A secret agent, posing as a journalist, from the &#8216;the world without&#8217;, penetrates &#8216;the world within&#8217; - Alphaville.

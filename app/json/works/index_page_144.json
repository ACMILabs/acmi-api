Fearing dismissal, Murakami trawls Tokyo&#8217;s underbelly encountering a slew of criminals, black market gunrunners and sleazy types in his quest to recover his weapon and halt the murders occurring at the hand of the thief. In Kurosawa&#8217;s ninth feature, the pace is languorous, reflecting the oppressive heat of Occupied Tokyo, sapping the resistance of the many characters that pepper the narrative, sweating their way through an excessive heatwave, battling poverty whilst living amid slums and atrocious post-war conditions. Kurosawa presents a fine example of a noir detective movie, exhibiting his technical virtuosity in a series of vignettes as Murakami chases thieves through grimy back alleys, and sleazy dancehalls, as his naivete ebbs away. Gloomy, intense and atmospheric, this film, about an obsessive quest, delineates a loss of innocence for a rookie cop in search of truth where poverty and degradation causes desperation and amorality to thrive in an urban setting.

However Bair escapes and leads the Mongolian army against the interventionists. The intensity of the drama, strong feeling for landscape and dramatic use of montage (four or five times the usual number of shots for a feature of this length) have been compared with the work of D.W. Griffith. In effect, the film is one long chase which takes on mythic proportions while the plot takes on metaphoric and lyrical dimensions (the British army is literally &#8216;blown away&#8217;). The emotional impact disguises the methodological rigour of Pudovkin&#8217;s construction. Also known as The Descendant of Genghis Khan. Cast includes Valeri Inkizhinov. This fully restored and digitally remastered version contains an original score by Timothy Brock performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mongolia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Soviet Union", "History&nbsp;→ Soviet Union - History - Revolution, 1917-1921", "Places&nbsp;→ Mongolia", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/storm-over-asia", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962219, "name": "Mosfilm", "creator_id": 4199, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962220, "name": "Vsevolod Pudovkin", "creator_id": 22941, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962218, "name": "Force Video", "creator_id": 77898, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50939", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 180, "name": "Soviet Union", "slug": "soviet-union"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1928", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1928"}], "labels": [32888], "external_references": [{"id": 5495, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "84273"}]}]}

Cutting a swathe through the bush is a dirt track lined with electricity transmission towers.</p>\n<p>On the mountain, we see children and adults learning to use their skis. There are lots of falls and numerous attempts to stand up again. There is some sled action on a type of sled typical to the era, and a big home-made metal sled with steering. Everyone herringbones back up the slope. Using the rope tow and ducking under the return rope .</p>\n<p>We see skiers ski in front of a building with the signage “Ski School”.</p>\n<p>There are lovely individual scenes of a man and a woman skiing past the camera dressed in the ski fashion of the day. A group of people practise their ski moves in front of the “Falls Creek Comfort Station”.</p>\n<p>Colourfully dressed children navigate the ski slopes, and an elderly man dressed in a coat and feathered trilby-style hat tries his hand at skiing.</p>\n<p>We see a lovely scene of the family as they take a break from skiing to have a picnic sitting in the snow. They have their thermos flask, sandwiches, and cordial.</p>\n<p>The film shows people being towed uphill and past a building with “ski lodge” signage.</p>\n<p>There are various scenes of skiers congregating together on the slopes and wide shots of them skiing in across and down the slopes.</p>\n<p>The final part of the film shows what could be accommodation Bogong Village. The village was originally constructed by the Victorian State Electricity Utility Commissions (SEC) from the 1930s and 1950s to house workers on the Kiewa Hydro Electric scheme.</p>\n<p>We see historic vehicles c1950/ 1960 with Victorian registration plates beginning with HEW: 4, parked in the street at the front of the houses. There are images of people as they walk down the street with the mountains in the background.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of fashion, ski wear, and ski techniques in the 60s.

His humble beginnings (and obsession) with ship modelmaking was to influence and inform his work throughout his career as an artist. Klippel was a self-taught artist whose interest sprung from the processes he&#8217;d developed while model building, a scale which was to continue in his work throughout his career. Klippel had a strong preference for the solid built form of sculpture but found his work naturally becoming more linear in style. His developed language in the fifties and his need for intellectual peers saw him travel to Europe and New York to again resettle in Sydney, Australia where he developed strong artistic allies and his notoriety as an abstract expressionist artist along with Olsen and Passmore.

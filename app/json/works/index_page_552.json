The Dental Space Commander and his assistants escape with the prized artefact the Wave Twister, which came from the hip-hop planet Quasar 16.33.45.78. The band of heroes, with B-Boy Grandpa, go to the planet hoping to revive the lost arts of hip-hop (scratching, rapping, breakdancing, and graffiti) which has been outlawed by the tyrannical Lord Ook and enforced by his Octobots and the master turntablism of DJ QBert, D-Styles, and Yoga Frog. Full of references to the new (virus scanners, internet, music downloads), and old (muscle cars, old video games, and schlocky science fiction), &#8220;Wave twisters&#8221; is a film that is a must for hip-hop and animation fans alike.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "German", "Japanese", "Polish", "Russian", "Spanish", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap musicians", "Musicals", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2471295, "name": "Eric Henry", "creator_id": 80164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q113377818", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2471293, "name": "Syd Garon", "creator_id": 80163, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q113377819", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2471292, "name": "Yoga Frog", "creator_id": 34849, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2471290, "name": "Thud Rumble Ltd", "creator_id": 34848, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50697", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32663]}, {"id": 74530, "acmi_id": "011720", "title": "Watt's last voyage", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "watts-last-voyage", "creator_credit": "Brian Davies and University of Melbourne.

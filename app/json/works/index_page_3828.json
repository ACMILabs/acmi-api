The film can be compared to a lyrical chamber piece where the direction of Kar-Wai, the luscious cinematography of Christopher Doyle, the musical score by Michael Galasso, the intimate performances of Cheung and Leung, and the stunning production design of William Chang Suk-Ping come together to form an astonishing powerful cinematic quintet. A love story that can justifiably be called timeless and mise-en-scene so romantic that it carries enormous emotion gravitas, this film has won awards throughout the globe (including Best Actor for Leung at Cannes as well as an outstanding technical achievement award for the combined talents of the filmmakers).</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>In 1962 Hong Kong, Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) are neighbours.

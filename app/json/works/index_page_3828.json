The program is centred around a study of the artists and the works condemned in Hitler&#8217;s &#8220;Degenerate Art&#8221; exhibition following his rise to power after the Great Depression. This badly presented, propaganda style exhibition took 650 abstract and expressionist works from museums and private collections around Germany and toured Germany and Austria for four years as an example of the abstraction and inner awareness that was unacceptable to Hitler&#8217;s vision for the new conformist Germany.

Carlos Saura amasses an impressive range of artists, over 300, who sing, dance and play music, expressing stories with fervour, dignity and evident respect for the tradition of flamenco art. With little dialogue, narratives are expressed through rumba, tango, ballet, taranta, song and music, in a variety of moods and styles, often in small collaborations but also in groups of twenty or more.

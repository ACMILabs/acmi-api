NOTE: This film is partially dubbed.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Anthony Quinn plays the deformed hunchbacked bell-ringer Quasimodo and Gina Lollobrigida stars as the beautiful gypsy dancing girl Esmeralda in this French/Italian adaptation of Victor Hugo&#8217;s all-time classic novel about friendship, love and loyalty. Lavish sets, costume and make-up, along with a cast of thousands, are used to create a historical epic in the style of such films as &#8220;The Ten commandments&#8221; and &#8220;Ben Hur&#8221;, but unfortunately does not quite succeed in the same way that these films did. The dialogue at times is perhaps overdone and the film comes across more as a theatrical presentation, lacking a sense of realism. However this is not to take away from Anthony Quinn and Gina Lollobrigida&#8217;s solid performances in their respective roles. Cast also includes Alaine Cuny, Jean Danet, Robert Hirsch, Danielle Dumont, Philippe Clay.

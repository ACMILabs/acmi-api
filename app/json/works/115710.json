On the surface the film is a comedy of manners based on the tradition of 18th century French theatre. Its richness lies in the contrast between ambiguity and clarity, the elaborate parallelisms between groups and specific characters and a pathbreaking melange of stylistic techniques. Renoir ironically exposes the moral bankruptcy of this world while remaining consistent with the model of classical theatre in his deployment of closure. The film&#8217;s influence lies in Renoir&#8217;s modernism. In portraying life-as-flux he juxtaposes what in his hands are formal devices for openness (mobile camera, depth of field, use of off-screen space) with the closure of classical narrative implied by, for example, shot-counter-shot editing.

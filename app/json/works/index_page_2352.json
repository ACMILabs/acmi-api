This film is a remake of the more philosophical version by Andrei Tarkovsky released in 1972, and is more a personal investigation into the themes of memory and regret rather than spirituality and science. Beautiful production design lends itself to the dreamy and sensual pace. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, this version is written and directed by Steven Soderbergh. Cast includes Jeremy Davies, Viola Davis and Ulrich Tukur.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Closed captioning", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Literature&nbsp;→ Polish literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Space flight - Psychological aspects"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 106}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2304390, "name": "Steven Soderbergh", "creator_id": 68097, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q103917", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304384, "name": "James Cameron", "creator_id": 66977, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q42574", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304388, "name": "Jon Landau", "creator_id": 67124, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q132451", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304385, "name": "Rae Sanchini", "creator_id": 81033, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298771", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304383, "name": "Lightstorm Entertainment", "creator_id": 67020, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2304380, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2304376, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52938", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34393]}, {"id": 94883, "acmi_id": "318912", "title": "Le Divorce", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "le-divorce-dvd", "creator_credit": "James Ivory, Ismail Merchant, Michael Schiffer, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Merchant Ivory Productions and Radar Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2003", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 453, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1306265"}], "brief_description": "<p>A stellar ensemble cast in this romantic drama/comedy about a cultural clash between a French husband, his American wife (Naomi Watts) and her sister (Kate Hudson).

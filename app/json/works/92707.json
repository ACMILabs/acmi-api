It is the (fictional) story of Australian artist Norman Lindsay (Sam Neill) who has raised the ire of the Church, with his erotically charged depictions of nude women. The Church regards his art as sinful, blasphemous and morally damaging. Lindsay is living on a large property in bohemian bliss with his wife (Pamela Rabe), children and models. An English preacher Anthony Campion (Hugh Grant) is sent to Lindsay&#8217;s property to try to dissuade him from continuing to paint and draw in his current style.

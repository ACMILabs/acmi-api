After the match, players of The Pirates kicked the balls to the Qing officials and the watching crowd for fun. Although insulted by The Pirates, the Qing officials dare not offend the foreigners, fearing that it may cause diplomatic trouble. A man called, Zhou Tian stood out and kicked the ball back to the captain of The Pirates, Harry, and broke the glass in his hand. The Pirates forced the Chinese to have a soccer match with them, which gave a big headache to the very incapable Qing officials. While the Qing officials were trying to catch the troublemaker, Zhou Tian, they selected a team for the match but ordered that they must not win the match. The fugitive, Zhou Tian, decided to organize a team to take Harry&#8217;s challenge. Harry&#8217;s fiancée, Jenny helped Zhou Tian and his team to escape the arrest.

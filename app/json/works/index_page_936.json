A political drama set against the backdrop of the Falkland&#8217;s crisis, the film takes a wry look at the Government&#8217;s attempt to justify the war. Set in the heartland of bourgeois England among media creators and academics, the personal, political and historical deceit of Thatcher&#8217;s Britain is ruthlessly exposed. Stars Jonathan Pryce and Tim Curry and features an astonishing climax as the crew and cast filmed undercover during the Conservative Party Conference.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Falkland Islands", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Places&nbsp;→ Falkland Islands"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952352, "name": "Greenpoint Films", "creator_id": 26362, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952353, "name": "Simon Relph", "creator_id": 23987, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952354, "name": "Ann Scott", "creator_id": 25869, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952355, "name": "Richard Eyre", "creator_id": 26363, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952351, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40201", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [23745]}]}

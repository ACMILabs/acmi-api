Without a doubt season five is the darkest of the lot but also sees creator Joss Whedon&#8217;s writing team at their most ingenious. A case in point, this is the season that Buffy&#8217;s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) is revealed (Eps. 79 Buffy Vs. Dracula and Eps. 80 Real me).

This plot strand is a perfect example how ideas are initially set up by Whedon and crew to have long term ramifications for the season and in this case for the entire series.

What Glory actually is simply goes down as one of the most breathtaking revelations in the series (Eps. 90 Checkpoint). Glory also proves to be quite literally an indestructible foe, lending the season a prevailing sense of fatalism that is ultimately realised in one unforgettable episode, The Body (Eps. 94 The Body).

From an original treatment by Francois Trauffaut, and with Claude Charbrol as artist and technical adviser. With Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>When the &#8220;young Turks&#8221; from the journal Cahiers du Cinema began making films in the late fifties, they revolutionised cinema by celebrating the look and attitudes of American pop-culture (B-movies, rock and roll) while infusing their own films with the uncertainties of a then distinctly European intellectual scrutiny. In &#8220;Breathless&#8221; a young hood kills a cop and goes on the run in Paris, hiding at his girlfriend&#8217;s flat until she betrays him. That&#8217;s life. Kiss-kiss, bang-bang. Playful, cool, name-dropping and audacious the film is true to its title, furiously exploring the possibilities of cinema while acknowledging its aesthetic debt to the low-budget films of Hollywood&#8217;s B-directors. Godard&#8217;s film remains the most influential of the French New Wave, and as the decade was to progress, Vietnam, Algiers and Maoism were to demand of him a more intellectually dense cinema. But in &#8220;Breathless&#8221; he is still the cheeky precocious brat, thumbing his nose at the world and inventing a new kind of film.

It is also the last of his &#8216;jidai-geki&#8217; (period films). For this particular film, Mizoguchi asked his art teacher of 40 years before to work as a colour consultant. In &#8216;Tales of the Taira Clan&#8217;, Mizoguchi lives up to his reputation of &#8216;feminist filmmaker&#8217;. This preoccupation with the status of women and their oppression in Japanese society can be traced back to Mizoguchi&#8217;s own childhood; following a family reversal of fortune, his 14-year old sister Suzu was put up for adoption and later on sold to a Geisha house. During the Allied occupation of Japan, Mizoguchi was encouraged to make films about women as a contribution to the democratisation of Japanese society. The theme of the self-sacrificing woman who is ultimately destroyed is recurrent is some of Mizoguchi&#8217;s best work, including &#8216;Osaka Elagy&#8217;, &#8216;The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums&#8217;, &#8216;The Life of Oharu&#8217;, &#8216;Sansho the Baillif&#8217; and &#8216;Ugetsu&#8217;.

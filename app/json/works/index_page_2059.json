Using the device of a diary and an extended flashback, Fereshteh (Niki Karima, Best Actress, Cairo International Film Festival) explains how her life changed drastically when she went to university, joined the Communist party, then fell in love with a married man. Feminist director Tahmineh Milani was imprisoned by the Islamic Revolutionary Court following the film&#8217;s release and is on parole; the film was also pulled from Tehran screens after a month but later returned.

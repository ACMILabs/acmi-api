He narrowly escapes the fate of his family&#8217;s trip to the death camps and survives with the help of friends and his own instinct and just pure willpower. A sympathetic German officer who is moved by his talent also spares and sustains his life. A moving portrayal of the plight of Polish Jews but one which also shows that there are good and bad people on every side during times of war.

The film received seven nominations in all, most notably the Best Actor Award going to Adrien Brody for his portrayal of Szpilman. A gifted composer and pianist, Szpilman was making regular appearances on Polish radio when the Nazis overran Warsaw. His family are taken to the walled Ghetto where Szpilman is able to make a meagre living by playing piano in a cafe where the more affluent and sometimes corrupt Jewish people dine. He narrowly escapes the fate of his family&#8217;s trip to the death camps and survives with the help of friends and his own instinct and just pure willpower. A sympathetic German officer who is moved by his talent also spares and sustains his life. A moving portrayal of the plight of Polish Jews but one which also shows that there are good and bad people on every side during times of war. Special edition two-disc set including a thirty-minute documentary on the making of the film. Other Awards include the Palme D&#8217;Or at Cannes 2002. Cast includes Thomas Kretschmann.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>An epic but true tale of the pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman&#8217;s struggle as a Polish Jew to survive World War II.

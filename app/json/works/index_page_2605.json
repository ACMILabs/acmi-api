This technicolour remake features a bright Rodgers and Hammerstein score and the wholesome pairing of Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews as a couple who fall in love at the fair. The songs include &#8220;That&#8217;s for me&#8221; and &#8220;It might as well be spring&#8221;. The film also stars Fay Bainter and Dick Haymes. Academy Award winner for Best Musical Score in 1945.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/state-fair", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2310295, "name": "Walter Lang", "creator_id": 22140, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q269796", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2310294, "name": "William Perlberg", "creator_id": 23739, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1422989", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2310293, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2310292, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37345", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1945", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1945"}], "labels": [20966]}, {"id": 81477, "acmi_id": "302575", "title": "A Sunday in the Country = Un Dimanche a la Campagne", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-sunday-in-the-country-un-dimanche-a-la-campagne", "creator_credit": "Bertrand Tavernier, Alain Sarde, Films A2, Little Bear and Sara Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1984", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46965, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1305215"}], "brief_description": "<p>A poignant and gently paced portrayal of one day in the life of M.

The history of the stone began in the seventeenth century when French merchant, Jean-Battiste Tavernier - travelling the world in search of exotic jewels - purchased a 112 carat diamond coloured an exquisite shade of blue. Tavernier sold this stone to King Louis XIV of France in 1668, who ordered it to be recut, and wore it on ceremonial occasions suspended from a ribbon. The &#8220;French Blue&#8221;, as it was now known, was reset again in 1749 for King Louis XV. During the French Revolution, the diamond was stolen during the looting of the crown jewels, and disappeared for several years before surfacing in the gem collection catalog of Henry John Hope, from whom the diamond takes its name. Following his death in 1839, the diamond passed through many hands, finally being bought by famed jeweler Pierre Cartier in 1909. Cartier showed the Hope Diamond to Mrs Evalyn Walsh McLean, an eccentric but wealthy patron, in 1910, but she disliked the setting, so Cartier had it reset, and offered it to her again. Mrs. McLean finally bought the stone, eventually having it reset as a pendant on a diamond necklace. Mrs. McLean wore the Hope diamond as a good luck charm, but was not immune from the alleged curse; her nine year old son was killed, her husband left her for another woman, the family newspaper went bankrupt, and her daughter overdosed on sleeping pills.

The history of the stone began in the seventeenth century when French merchant, Jean-Battiste Tavernier - travelling the world in search of exotic jewels - purchased a 112 carat diamond coloured an exquisite shade of blue. Tavernier sold this stone to King Louis XIV of France in 1668, who ordered it to be recut, and wore it on ceremonial occasions suspended from a ribbon. The &#8220;French Blue&#8221;, as it was now known, was reset again in 1749 for King Louis XV. During the French Revolution, the diamond was stolen during the looting of the crown jewels, and disappeared for several years before surfacing in the gem collection catalog of Henry John Hope, from whom the diamond takes its name. Following his death in 1839, the diamond passed through many hands, finally being bought by famed jeweler Pierre Cartier in 1909. Cartier showed the Hope Diamond to Mrs Evalyn Walsh McLean, an eccentric but wealthy patron, in 1910, but she disliked the setting, so Cartier had it reset, and offered it to her again.

In the film&#8217;s last third, the stock changes from black and white film to digital video and the colours have the vividness and expression of post-impressionist painting.

The discordant sounds and jump-cuts of his earlier films have given way to a more mediative mise-en-scene, but his experimentation with sound and image are still provoking and exciting. This film is a philosophical essay on the changing faces of love, an argument against Hollywood&#8217;s monopoly of the image, a melancholy ode to a vanishing Paris, an examination on age, passion and politics, and a celebration of the possibilities in both film and video. At the twilight of his life, Godard has created an ode that still argues for the importance and value in something called history, in something called cinema.

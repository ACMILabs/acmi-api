The result is &#8216;Colour Of War&#8217; a remarkable insight into the event that has shaped our modern world. Dramatic colour footage from as early as 1933 shows home movies of Adolf Hitler and his co-horts, the devastation wrought by the Blitz, life on the home front, D-Day and the Allied Invasion of France, British bombers defying German fighters, the horror of the Holocaust that greeted troops as they entered Germany and the jubilation of VE Day. With John Thaw&#8217;s narration and spoken accounts from the letters and diaries of those who fought, those who survived, and those the war claimed as victims, this three part documentary is an extraordinary remembrance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Home movies and video", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - United States", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Documentary"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1393848, "name": "Alastair Laurence", "creator_id": 81077, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1393847, "name": "Lucy Carter", "creator_id": 81076, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1393846, "name": "Transworld International", "creator_id": 19136, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1393845, "name": "Carlton Television", "creator_id": 58875, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 94963, "acmi_id": "318999", "title": "Colour of war [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "colour-of-war-dvd", "creator_credit": "Alastair Laurence, Lucy Carter, Transworld International and Carlton Television", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1999", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "58737", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [55048]}, {"id": 75121, "acmi_id": "012378", "title": "A Year of change in three children (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-year-of-change-in-three-children-tefc", "creator_credit": "Chris Cuthbertson and BBC-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Cognitive Development&#8221;.<br />\nIt is not until 5 years old or so that children come to understand the notions of conservation of area, length and weight.

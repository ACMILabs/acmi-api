Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era. The footage of the snow lodge and landscape is a good historical reflection of the architecture, furniture, and the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Title: Falls Creek 1964<br />\n00:00:18:00 Snowhaven Lodge signage on lodge wall<br />\n00:00:27:00 Exterior shot of Snowhaven Lodge<br />\n00:01:26:00 Children reading and knitting on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:03:23:00 Two people prepare to ski outside the lodge<br />\n00:03:57:00 The family have their meal on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:04:31:00 Title: NEDSA 1964<br />\n00:06:25:00 A young girl wearing ski goggles exclaims to the camera<br />\n00:06:52:00 Finishing line banner “Kastle Ski” and “Finish”<br />\n00:06:57:00 Skiers standing together with snow-covered slopes in the background<br />\n00:08:19:00 Timekeepers with stop watches and camera stand together with skiers at the end of a run.

Renowned for pushing his body to its limits through durational performance, body modification and surgical enhancement, Stelarc has established a decades-long practice that explores the intersection between the human body and technology, proposing a post-human understanding of the world. This unique archive of video and photographic documentation spans the artist’s early hook suspensions and internal body probes to performances with a robotic third arm and experiments in virtual realities.</p>\n<p>The collection is housed on a variety of formats used since the introduction of video in the 1970s, including reel-to-reel tape, VHS, U-Matic, SP Betacam and Mini DV. These variable formats are currently being digitised to ensure the preservation and legacy of the artist’s archive.</p>\n<p>The Stelarc Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the artist through the Cultural Gifts Program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Moving Image Collection"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1667542, "name": "Stelarc", "creator_id": 8996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "video_links": [{"id": 1381, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFOe0JbUdJk"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "video_links": [{"id": 1382, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--2cUhHwo60"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}, {"id": 118261, "acmi_id": "B2003948", "title": "[Stelarc: The Third Hand Tokyo 1981]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-the-third-hand-tokyo-1981", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "173786", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970s-2000s Decade", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970s-2000s Decade"}], "labels": [58688], "external_references": []}, {"id": 119315, "acmi_id": "B2005027", "title": "[Tony Agapitos: Easter celebrations at Green Hill]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tony-agapitos-easter-celebrations-at-green-hill", "creator_credit": "Tony Agapitos", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1960s-1970s", "video_links": [{"id": 1454, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/vm_zdbwJRwA"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This film shows Greek Easter celebrations, including a community BBQ, cooking lamb on a spit, music and dancing.</p>\n<p>This film is part of a collection of 16mm films made by Tony Agapitos.

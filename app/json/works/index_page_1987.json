The dichotomy between natural and urban landscape is mirrored in Earl Howard&#8217;s haunting score, which shifts from the ringing of wind chimes to the magnified ambient sounds of the city street.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:11:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["two-channel, six-monitor installation"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["two-channel, six-monitor installation, video, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2618056, "name": "Mary Lucier", "creator_id": 6393, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618059, "name": "Gregg Featherman", "creator_id": 73089, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121314928", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2618060, "name": "Lower Manhattan Cultural Council", "creator_id": 6397, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315700", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2618057, "name": "Earl Howard", "creator_id": 73088, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360904", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2618061, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2618058, "name": "Earl Howard", "creator_id": 73088, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360904", "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "113", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [47443]}, {"id": 107929, "acmi_id": "B1000101", "title": "Bourgeois dictionaries (Private Hungary 7)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bourgeois-dictionaries-private-hungary-7", "creator_credit": "Peter Forgacs and Marta Revesz", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Hungary, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Forgacs recontextualizes archival home movies and film journals from the 1930s through to the 1950s, taking small moments, individual shots or whole sequences from a variety of sources and editing them together into a mosaic of middle class Hungarian life.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack layers political radio broadcasts of the times over the ambient music of Tibor Szemzo, creating a sense of expectancy, of fate.

There is very funny footage of children playing various party games including the Chocolate Game. This game involves participants rolling a dice, racing to dress up in a costume and then eating chocolate with a knife and fork. There is also a Dress Up Relay race. We see the children dash back and forth with costumes packed into a TEAL branded airline - style bag. The TEAL acronym may stand for Tasman Empire Airways Limited, which was the forerunner of Air New Zealand, established in 1940. The children unpack their costumes, dress up and then dash back to the next person in line, all the while keeping an eye on how fast their competition is going.</p>\n<p>There is an amusing sequence of children playing the Lifesaver Toothpick game.

The Donkey in this instance appears to be called “Flowery”. There is also a balloon catching game played around an above ground backyard swimming pool, and Food on a String being played using chocolate, coconut covered snowballs strung from a monkey bar.

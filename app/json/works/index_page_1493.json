The lavish sets and costumes entertainingly evoke the bucolic life of 17th century Flanders, in a successful attempt to deliver, writ-large, the poetic setting of a Flemish masterpiece. A sharp amusing script has made this film a continuous favourite with audiences. Controversially, the film was banned in Germany, suspected of parodying the rising Nazi army.

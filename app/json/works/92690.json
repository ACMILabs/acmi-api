The 1600 sq. km beat covers bush, river and rugged coastline, complete with large saltwater crocodiles. The area is made up of cattle stations, aboriginal settlements and tourist resorts. The episode follows a team of policemen and local Aboriginal volunteers who search for a missing tourist. The trip involves camping and travelling in rugged conditions in which the men have to be self-sufficient. With heat and dehydration being the major concern, they track and find the man with a broken ankle, desperate for a cigarette.

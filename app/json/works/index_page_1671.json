Killed off in &#8220;The Final problem&#8221; in 1893, Holmes met his fate after falling into a waterfall chasing his nemesis, Moriaty - neither body was recovered. Years later, Conan Doyle became interested in folklore surrounding the legend of the Hound of the Baskervilles: Sir Hugo and his hounds of hell, punished by a fierce dog for attacking a young woman, his family fated to misfortune forever after. The only man up to the task was Holmes, and the claim was made that the Baskerville investigation was an old case rediscovered after his death.

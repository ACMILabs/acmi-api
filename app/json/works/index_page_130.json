The plot follows Tom as he is kicked out of home and travels to London, pursued by the woman he loves. There are plenty of adventures along the way, including much feasting, heaving of breasts, sword fighting and a masked ball, just to name a few. The truth of Jones&#8217; parentage is always in question, he doesn&#8217;t even know who his real parents are. None of the hardships faced during Tom&#8217;s adventure bother him and it&#8217;s not often that the smile leaves his attractive face.

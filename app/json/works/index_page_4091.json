The war serves merely as a backdrop for their tragic romance. The film is mostly concerned with the fate of Catherine and Frederick - their quick but ardent meeting, their mock wedding in a hospital room, their long and painful separation during which Frederic deserts the army, and Catherine&#8217;s death in childbirth. Their farewell scene, where Catherine dies in Frederic&#8217;s arms as the bells peal out Armistice, is a moving climax to this all time classic of the screen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-farewell-to-arms-1932", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 948996, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948997, "name": "Frank Borzage", "creator_id": 22859, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q369190", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 948995, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36617", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1932", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1932"}], "labels": [20284], "external_references": [{"id": 3147, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1575490"}, {"id": 3319, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "22649"}]}]}

Her projects across media are concerned with lineages of representation, politics and history in public exchange, and practices of collectivity on small and large scale, both fleeting and durational. Her newest works experiment with models of sustained creative collaboration between strangers. Kelly’s moving image artworks have been shown around the world, in galleries, cinemas and projected onto rock formations, buildings and clouds.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>The Gods of Tiny Things</i> is a vast, microscopic Eden teeming with deities born from the pages of old magazines and encyclopedias, creating an exquisite collage of grotesque beauty and new mythologies.

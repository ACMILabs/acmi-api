Fraternising in petty crime, Joao becomes drawn to the stage, and develops an exotic show, replete with elaborate costumes and erotic themes. But Joao&#8217;s temper and talents with a switchblade, land him in constant strife. This bio-pic, directed by Karim Ainouz, is an exciting and gritty presentation of a paradoxical personality; he lays bare the realities and squalor of poverty whilst bringing all the glamour of performance art to the screen.

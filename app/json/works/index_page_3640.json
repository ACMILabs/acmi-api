McKee urges the viewer to see beyond the mythology of &#8220;Citizen Kane.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Appreciation", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1104399, "name": "Gary Johnstone", "creator_id": 26424, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104398, "name": "Channel 4", "creator_id": 21799, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1104397, "name": "Fulman Productions", "creator_id": 26423, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1104396, "name": "VEA", "creator_id": 21531, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115423, "acmi_id": "S01224", "title": "J'accuse", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jaccuse", "creator_credit": "Channel Four and Fulmar Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 84748, "acmi_id": "306083", "title": "The Divine Mozart", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-divine-mozart", "creator_credit": "Andrew Forrester, Jeremy Bugler, Channel Four and Fulmar", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1991", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 84747, "acmi_id": "306082", "title": "Van Gogh", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "van-gogh", "creator_credit": "Gary Johnstone, Channel Four and Fulmar", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1990", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40379", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [23921]}, {"id": 75988, "acmi_id": "013696", "title": "Citizen Kane (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "citizen-kane-tefc", "creator_credit": "Orson Welles and Mercury Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1941", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1941-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A faceless journalist sets out to investigate the life of media magnate and failed politician Charles Foster Kane.

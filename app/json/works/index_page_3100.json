Many of these elements are touched on in this program in order to come to terms with the history and current experience of the community through interviews with past and present residents, teachers and students from neighbouring schools, the Park&#8217;s designer and architect and through commentary from journalist Robert Fulford and the documentary&#8217;s director, Andrew Faiz, himself a former resident.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Housing", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Housing", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Housing", "Places&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 817339, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817340, "name": "Gerry Flahive", "creator_id": 80524, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817341, "name": "Andrew Faiz", "creator_id": 80525, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817338, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51695", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33373]}, {"id": 118138, "acmi_id": "", "title": "Fleetwood Mac (this is the one)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fleetwood-mac-this-is-the-one", "creator_credit": "Nathan Apodaca", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2020", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2031-02-16", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Digital screen recording from @420doggface208's TikTok", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2020-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In a year many spent locked inside, Nathan Apodaca gliding down a highway on a skateboard, drinking Ocean Spray and lip-synching Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’ was the tonic we all needed.</p>", "constellations_primary": [{"id": 295, "name": "Film and TV dreams", "description": "Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' coasted its way back up the charts 40 years after it was first released, thanks to Nathan Apodaca's joyous viral TikTok, but Fleetwood Mac (and Stevie Knicks) have been main staples of screen culture for decades."}], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Fleetwood Mac (this is the one)</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Nathan Apodaca</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 2020</p>", "description": "<p><b>This video features in a responsive display in the museum that presents the moments, stories and memes capturing the zeitgeist by going viral on the internet.</b></p>\n<p>In a year many spent locked inside, Nathan Apodaca gliding down a highway on a skateboard, drinking Ocean Spray and lip-synching Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Dreams’ was the tonic we all needed.

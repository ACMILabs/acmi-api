This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film begins with the title &#8216;Beauty in Victoria&#8217; which is Kenneth&#8217;s reference to the beauty that includes nature, the Queen, a &#8216;bathing beauty&#8217; contest and city night lights. Titles for the reel also include &#8216;Visit the Buchan Caves&#8217; with specific directions to a &#8216;Modern Camp Site&#8217; both of which introduce a lengthy look at the Buchan area. The reel ends with a quick look at &#8216;Port Campbell&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:28:00 on the way to the caves, the Rankines make a stop at the Caves Hotel where Mrs Rankine keeps an eye on a magpie alongside the family car which as always, features in Kenneth&#8217;s travel footage.</p>\n<p>00:00:39:00 the camp site is within the &#8216;Buchan Caves National Park&#8217; whcih is well signed on an overhead stone archway.</p>\n<p>00:00:49:00 begins a sequence of shots that show off the &#8216;modern&#8217; camp site. We see the &#8216;A E LIND&#8217; Swimming Pool, the various amenities and stone and timber buildings of the camp area such as the &#8216;Children&#8217;s Playground&#8217;, &#8216;Kitchen&#8217; and &#8216;Carwash&#8217;.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film titled &#8216;Fragments of 1940&#8217;, contains several segments each with its own title and other smaller scenes. Kenneth&#8217;s  views around the city and the Botanical Gardens as well as his own garden which often features in his films. We see good examples of signs of the era for shops and businesses such as a large wall sign for &#8216;Sidney Cooke&#8217; printers: a business which later became CMI Fasteners Manufacturers of NZ. The &#8216;Our Garden&#8217; segment shows the Rankine home garden where Kenneth captures the family circle enjoying themselves among the flowers, trees and gardening activities. There is a look at an Anzac Day parade and friends appear in military uniform - a reminder of the current war. There is also a segment showing daughter Bettye&#8217;s school sports day (uniforms indicate possible colleges, Genazzano and Vaucluse).</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:11:00 title card &#8216;Fragments of 1940&#8217; followed by sub-title, &#8216;Melbourne&#8217; begins the footage with panoramic views around Melbourne, possibly taken from somewhere in Elizabeth St as smoke from industry can be seen on the horizon presumably to the west and buildings in Elizabeth feature later in the reel.</p>\n<p>00:01:30:00 there is a view likely to be from Royal Parade looking down Elizabeth St including the Queen Victoria Market to the right of the screen at 00:00:00:00. Scenes following feature some examples of the trams and cars of the 1940&#8217;s era.</p>\n<p>00:01:55:00 there is a dockside shot likely to be Port Melbourne. Footage shows Melbourne buildings in the CBD including the roof of the APA Tower in Collins St.</p>\n<p>00:02:19:00 we see examples of Melbourne&#8217;s business signs of the time on various buildings including half a very recognisable Myer store sign as well as Flinders St Station facade at the end of the street.</p>\n<p>00:02:37:00 title card &#8216;Botanical Gardens Melbourne&#8217; appears beginning a segment of views around the Gardens.</p>\n<p>00:03:35:00 the conservatory at the Botanical Gardens.</p>\n<p>00:06:31:00 school girls participating in athletic sports in a park.</p>\n<p>00:08:24:00 cricket teams take over the park while the school gives out the prizes for the day.</p>\n<p>00:10:06:00 starts scenes at several beaches with members of the Rankine family and possibly friends. We see swimmers as well as beach strolling and the Rankines under a large umberella.</p>\n<p>00:12:33:00 the Rankines return to a garden setting and house verandah, possibly situated in the Dandenongs.</p>\n<p>00:13:09:00 title &#8216;Our Garden&#8217; appears followed by sub-title &#8216;Come into our Garden&#8217; which is filmed on glass looking through to a colourful garden and one of the Rankine family beckoning us in.</p>\n<p>00:13:47:00 scenes of the women in the Rankine circle potting flowers.</p>\n<p>00:14:50:00 ball games in the garden driveway.</p>\n<p>00:15:11:00 an interesting shot of two of the Rankine women walking along the driveway, seemingly one to work (books and briefcase) and daughter Bettye to school (books in hand). Followed by shots of trees and flowers.</p>\n<p>00:16:10:00 Mrs Rankine hosing the garden and Bettye prepared for tennis.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film is made up of two distinct parts, both showing off the beauty and destinations of Tasmania and both capturing the courtship and marriage of the main people in the films, Val and Len.</p>\n<p>In the first part, Kenneth uses a series of ‘intertitle’ cards to introduce his viewers to a conversation between ‘Valerie Sparks’ and ‘Len Couchman’ about Tasmania, which is ‘beyond the blue horizon’. What follows is a scenic tour of Tasmania interjected by moments of Valerie and Len sitting on a bench looking out to sea, continuing to talk of Tasmania over the course of a few days. During these chats, Valerie and Len become closer and end the first part of the film with arms around each other’s shoulders.</p>\n<p>The second part of the film, title card ‘KenRa Films Present’ appears before we see Valerie and then Len in close-ups followed by title card, ‘Val. and Len. Couchman in’ and ‘”The Sequel” to The Blue Horizon’, thus showing the audience that the single Val and Len of the first film have now married.</p>\n<p>As well as showing Tasmania as an interesting travel spot, both parts of this film include wonderful examples of late 1940s scenes - piers, shipping and boats, cars, trucks and Hobarts historic (and no longer used) trams, streets, shops and signs – all of which show the styles of living and working at the time.</p>\n<p>Another point of historic interest is that of the fashion displayed by both men and women at the wedding. The bride chooses a cocktail style ensemble in blue rather than a long white dress and she and her attendant (Bettye Rankine Wootton) carry smaller floral bouquet in the style of a corsage. The guests wear low key but elegant outfits, the women in ‘frocks’ and suits that go well with matching hats, gloves, bags, shoes and sometimes corsages and the men in double breasted suits that indicate a particular style of the era.</p>\n<p>Another point of interest in the film is the scenes of the operation of the ‘Bridgewater Bridge and Causeway’ over the Derwent River between Bridgewater and Granton north of Hobart and which was fully operational at the time. Construction on the steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939 and completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river. The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia.</p>\n<p>Finally. at Port Arthur the camera focuses on the crumbling masonry and ruins of the buildings which seems to capture the awful history of the site.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 pre-title certificate -

What follows is a scenic tour of Tasmania interjected by moments of Valerie and Len sitting on a bench looking out to sea, continuing to talk of Tasmania over the course of a few days.

The director, who also wrote the script, refuses to pathologise or romanticise his young characters and instead dignifies their stubborn resistance to conformity as a passive ethical opposition to a crumbling world. But he does not hide the ugliness or the cruelty of his characters. In this remarkable movie, Bresson explores the beginning of the western under-class which was to emerge with such alienated force at the end of the twentieth century. The film begins by posing a question: was a young man murdered or did he commit suicide? By the end of the film, this unanswerable question is left to haunt the viewer with its bitter suggestion that we are all in part responsible. In French with English subtitles.

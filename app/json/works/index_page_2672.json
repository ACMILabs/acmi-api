For the starring roles Melville, godfather of the New Wave, ironically selected two talented actors catapulted to fame by that movement&#8212; Emmanuelle Riva (&#8216;Hiroshima mon amour&#8217;) and Jean-Paul Belmondo (&#8216;Breathless&#8217;). The poetic results are literary and personal; the heroine&#8217;s offscreen narration suggests the pre-Bressonian form of Melville&#8217;s first feature, &#8216;Le silence de la mer&#8217;, and sudden subjective shots convey the woman&#8217;s physical proximity to the priest as she undergoes an ambiguous religious conversion. Not an unqualified success, the film remains strong for its performances, its inventive editing and framing, and its evocative rendering of the French Occupation. According to Melville, the film ran for 193 minutes in its pre-release form; he edited out 65 minutes, and another 18 minutes are missing from the present version. The eclectic and resourceful non jazz score is by jazz pianist Martial Solal. Reference: Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader.

Cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Brainwashing", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mind control", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychologists", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964877, "name": "Focus Features", "creator_id": 68244, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964878, "name": "Steve Golin", "creator_id": 68280, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7612676", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964879, "name": "Anthony Bregman", "creator_id": 68278, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964880, "name": "Michel Gondry", "creator_id": 68267, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964876, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53053", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [34501], "external_references": [{"id": 418, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q208269"}, {"id": 4088, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "38"}]}, {"id": 95327, "acmi_id": "319395", "title": "Escape to Witch Mountain", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "escape-to-witch-mountain", "creator_credit": "Walt Disney Productions, Jerome Courtland and John Hough", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Two orphans develop telekinetic powers and escape from exploitative adults with the aid of a grieving widow.

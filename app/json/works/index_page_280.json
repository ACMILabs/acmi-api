His anxiety soon turns into a full blown panic attack prompting the tough guy to contact psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). The neurotic Sobel initially refuses to take Vitti on as a patient but soon finds that the desperate criminal doesn&#8217;t take rejection well. Director Harold Ramis uses this comedic premise effectively, parodying the mobs &#8216;tough guy&#8217; ethos, while lampooning an assortment of familiar gangster films. The casting of DeNiro is a joke in itself as the actor sends up his previous film incarnations as the quintessential Mafia &#8216;wiseguy&#8217;.

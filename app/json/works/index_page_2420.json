Their initial exuberance gives way to panic when the owner returns for his crop. The group lock him into the basement while they figure out what to do. Starting as a light comedy, &#8220;Scarfies&#8221; shifts a gear and becomes increasingly black, resulting in a nightmarish thriller where the central characters&#8217; morale and logic having fallen apart give way to desperate behaviour. Cast includes: Willa O&#8217;Neill, Neill Rea, Ashleigh Seagar, Taika Cohen, Charlie Bleakley, John Brazier, Mark Neilson and Mark Dudfield.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social conditions", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students - Attitudes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs, Nonprescription"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961782, "name": "Nightmare Productions", "creator_id": 34838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961783, "name": "Lisa Chatfield", "creator_id": 34839, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961784, "name": "Robert Sarkis", "creator_id": 34840, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961781, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50680", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32653], "external_references": [{"id": 5323, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "13892"}]}, {"id": 72504, "acmi_id": "009456", "title": "Scandinavian Lands (Norway, Sweden, Denmark)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "scandinavian-lands-norway-sweden-denmark", "creator_credit": "Coronet Instructional Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1954", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1954-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>An introduction to the geography, people, customs and standards of living of Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

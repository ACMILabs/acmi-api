When Sabrina befriends another half-witch Nicole, a girl spurned by the in-group, and the pair aid each other&#8217;s transition into witch-hood, the kind-hearted Sabrina learns the perils of slavish conformity in order to belong. Academy rules are that a witch is true to her friends, true to herself and uses magic wisely, themes which the narrative supports through Sabrina&#8217;s at school experiences. This film, suitable for children and pitched at teens and pre-teens, has an endearing comic tone that supports the funky neo-feminist values of &#8216;girl power&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animation - Juvenile films", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School environment", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Conformity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Peer pressure", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witchcraft", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witches", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2259627, "name": "Scott Heming", "creator_id": 36134, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078871", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2259626, "name": "Chuck Grimes", "creator_id": 72218, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2259625, "name": "DIC Entertainment", "creator_id": 27005, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035333", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2259622, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52124", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33749]}, {"id": 77105, "acmi_id": "015301", "title": "S.P.L.A.S.H.", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "splash", "creator_credit": "Michael Mills, Judy LeGros and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This fast-paced and entertaining animated film is about water and the demands placed on our waterways by agriculture, industry, and urban life.

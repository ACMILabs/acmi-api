Lily Bart (in an exquisite performance by &#8220;X-Files&#8221; star Gillian Anderson) is an intelligent, unconventional woman in her late 20s, torn between a constraining, rigid society and her own individuality. In order to remain a member of New York&#8217;s elite social circle, Lily realises she must marry a wealthy, respectable man. But finding someone who will nourish her intellect, appreciate her unconventionality and provide the funds is painstakingly difficult.

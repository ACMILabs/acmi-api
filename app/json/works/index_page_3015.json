Director Feliks Falk is representative of the 70s new Polish cinema, the &#8220;cinema of moral anxiety&#8221; and for this, if for no other reason, &#8220;Top dog&#8221; is both intriguing and entertaining. Cast also includes Slawa Kwasniewska, Wiktor Sadecki, Michal Tarkowski, Ewa Kolasinska, Ryszard Kotys, Jerzy Kryszak.

The film follows the events that occur after Brett Sprague (David Wenham), is released from prison after serving time for assaulting the manager of a local bottle shop. Brett&#8217;s presence creates a constant sense of tension as everybody in the house - his mother Sandra (Lynette Curran), his two brothers Glenn (John Polson) and Steve (Anthony Hayes), his girlfriend Michelle (a fantastic performance from Toni Collete), Glenn&#8217;s wife Jackie (Jeanette Cronin), Steve&#8217;s pregnant girlfriend Nola (Anna Lise) and Sandra&#8217;s boyfriend George (Pete Smith) - treads carefully around Brett&#8217;s restrained anger. The film ocassionally flashes forward to the arrest and trial of the three brothers, building up the suspense as we wait for Brett to explode into violence.

Using a melange of face to face interviews with the author, audio readings, archival footage and re-enactments, McCourt talks about what it was like to grow up as a poor, Irish Catholic, what inspired him to come to America and his passion for self education, his teaching years, how his family reacted to the novel, and the backlash by Limerick locals and in particular the Catholic Church. The documentary provides a solid background to McCourt&#8217;s history and plans for the future, as well as including interviews with his brother, Malachy, and director Neil Jordan about what it was like to make the film adaptation.

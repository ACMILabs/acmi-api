This can be achieved by mixing in a test tube, by injecting DNA into the nucleus or by using a virus or bacterium to carry the DNA into the new organism. Examples are shown of these techniques in use. The program then moves on to canvas the views of notable interested people on some of the issues associated with genetic engineering. Those interviewed include, Gus Nossal, feminist Robyn Rowland, Carmel Travers, Peter Singer - a philosopher, Peter Garrett and Merilyn Sleigh - a genetic engineer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Genetic engineering", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1813923, "name": "Malcolm Paterson", "creator_id": 20308, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298883", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 778288, "name": "CSIRO", "creator_id": 12109, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1117048", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 778287, "name": "CSIRO", "creator_id": 12109, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1117048", "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38146", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [21745]}, {"id": 82703, "acmi_id": "303865", "title": "Genetic engineering and protein synthesis", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "genetic-engineering-and-protein-synthesis", "creator_credit": "CSIRO, Benchmark Films and FWU", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This video uses brilliantly clear animation techniques to explain aspects of genetic engineering and protein synthesis.

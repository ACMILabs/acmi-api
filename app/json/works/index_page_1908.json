When it became obvious that the Dutch government had no interest in granting independance to Indonesia, Ivens resigned. Working clandestinely, he recorded this film in support of the struggle by the Indonesian people to gain their independance. The film shows efforts by Australian dockworkers and striking Indonesian seamen to prevent the shipment of arms and ammunition to Indonesia aboard Dutch vessels. Cinematography, Marion Michelle.

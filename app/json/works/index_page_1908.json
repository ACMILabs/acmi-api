Anderson (1924–1993) was a film distributor, cinema owner and photographer as well as an enthusiastic filmmaker in and around Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat. In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s. A feature of the parade is the Radio Cabs entry which is a car covered in paper flowers. The Radio Cabs company in Ballarat was started by the film maker and his family and friends.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes from a street parade in Ballarat in regional Victoria during the 1940s or 1950s. The parade is in the style of the era - featuring floats made by and promoting local groups and businesses, government departments and marching bands.</p>\n<p>Another feature is a large street march of citizens concerned with world peace, conscription, suppression of First Nations people, workers rights, keeping prices down and the atom bomb. It is interesting to note the large contingent of women marching in the parade and the professionally painted banners and placards.</p>\n<p>Jack has also captured an exciting motorcycle grand prix at Ballarat which includes spectacular side car racing.

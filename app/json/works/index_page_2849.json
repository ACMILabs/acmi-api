Laurence Moody): Zandra wants special permission to marry in jail. Shell is aggravated to discover she&#8217;s being traded in for younger model. Denny gets a new roommate in the religious Crystal. &#8220;The Victim&#8221; (wri. Martin Allen, dir. Laurence Moody): Zandra organises an abortion of her ex-fiancee&#8217;s child and uses it as an opportunity to escape. Rachel fears for her safety as Shell&#8217;s bullying escalates and she&#8217;s moved from her single cell back in with the others. Nikki breaks up with Trish and discloses to Monica why she&#8217;s in there. &#8220;Tangled web&#8221; (wri. Louise Page, dir. Laurence Moody): An investigation is commenced into Rachel&#8217;s death and Fenner has his own agenda to attend to. Shell makes the surprise announcement that she wants to sing at the funeral.

Through one such project, a documentary about teenagers, she meets and befriends three of her subjects, Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix), Lydia (Alison Folland) and Russell (Casey Affleck), three awkward teens with very low self esteem.

Joaquin Phoenix and Alison Folland are impressive as the painfully shy teens, while Kidman&#8217;s performance is spot on as the cold and calculating Suzanne.

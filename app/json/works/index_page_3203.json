"brief_description": "<p>Director Masaki Kobayashi&#8217;s quartet of self contained ghost stories uses to spellbinding effect highly stylised sets, expressionistic lighting and painterly backdrops in the retelling of 19th century English Orientalist Lafcadio Hearn&#8217;s writings. &#8216;Kwaidan&#8217;s&#8216; (which translates to ghost story) eerie mood is sealed by its mesmerizing and modest credit sequence followed by the first story, the foreboding &#8216;Shadowings&#8217;. The next instalment, &#8216;Yuki Onna&#8217; (Snow Woman) uses lurid lighting and its contrived studio sets to maximum dream-like effect, while &#8216;The story of Miminashi Hoichi&#8217; incorporates various modes of ancient Japanese story telling with breathtaking results. Finally, &#8216;In a cup of Tea&#8217;s&#8216; grimly surreal coda of a publisher&#8217;s frustration with the inconclusiveness of many Japanese ghost stories, aptly completes this remarkable anthology. Kobayashi&#8217;s meticulous direction, (Kobayashi&#8217;s obsessive aesthetic control drove him to hand paint all the sets himself) along with the unsettling soundtrack by Toru Takemitsu make this a unique film experience. In Japanese with English subtitles.

As well as attempting to delve into the psyches of Cobain and Love (aka Frances Farmer), Broomfield looks at the various theories surrounding Cobain&#8217;s death, which was shrouded in mystery and which instantly became part of the long list of conspiracy theories which our society finds so compelling. Broomfield&#8217;s documentary is in no way objective, but it is fascinating to watch, as the director pointedly incorporates his own battle to get his film made with Courtney Love vehemently attempting to stop the film. With home footage of Cobain and interviews with people who knew Cobain and Love, this is a must see for Nirvana fans (although due to legal constraints Broomfield could not use any music by Nirvana in the film).

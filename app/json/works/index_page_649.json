However, this program examines how the long Aboriginal occupation of Australia witnessed spectacular changes. Generations of Aborigines saw the great rising of the seas which isolated Australia; they saw, and probably influenced, sweeping changes in vegetation and wildlife. The Aborigines created a lifestyle which suited their environment. They were skilled herbalists and master trappers and hunters. Their nomadic wanderings followed a logical pattern, reflecting their forethought and knowledge of the land.

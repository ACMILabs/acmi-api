They were renowned for their generosity to charitable causes and were heavily involved with the War Bond drives during WWII but each had their own personal demons to deal with including Lou&#8217;s problem with gambling and Bud&#8217;s problems with drinking and epilepsy. Harvey Korman stars as Bud Abbott, Buddy Hackett as Lou Costello, and Arte Johnson plays their loyal agent Eddie Sherman.

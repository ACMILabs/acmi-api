The game was released in November 1993, the same month that another game with the same title was released by Virgin Games for Sega Genesis. The two games vary in several respects, including the fact that Aladdin carries a sword in the Virgin game but does not in the Capcom game, a fact that Shinji Mikami, the Capcom game&#8217;s designer, said made the Virgin game better. The Capcom game was ported to Game Boy Advance (GBA) on March 19, 2004.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Formats/platforms", "display_values": ["Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)", "Game Boy Advance", "Super Famicom"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["E (ESRB)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action", "Adventure", "Platform", "Single player"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Aladdin_(Capcom_video_game)", "title": "en.wikipedia.org", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/561100", "title": "store.steampowered.com", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://www.gog.com/game/disney_aladdin", "title": "gog.com", "source": "vernon"}], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 337, "name": "Gameplay video", "uri": "https://youtu.be/5IXhJs8DZt0"}], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 17064, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/co25nz.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 810, "height": 1080, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "IGDB", "slug": "igdb"}, "source_identifier": "2473", "production_places": [], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993-11-21", "notes": "", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [57619]}, {"id": 66826, "acmi_id": "22438", "title": "Dishwashing by hand", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dishwashing-by-hand", "creator_credit": "Dale W.

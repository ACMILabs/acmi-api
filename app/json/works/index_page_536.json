Stereotype roles even carry down to children who feature in television advertising. However, it also covers the gradual breaking down of the traditional rules of sex roles including women in sport, women employed in male occupations, women becoming members in male dominated clubs and entering those hallowed domains which once used to be reserved for men only. Includes interviews with Bettina Arndt, Abigail, Dr Patricia Edgar, Phillip Adams, Patsy Adam Smith and others and contains advertising images, archival footage (including the Melbourne Cup fashion parades and Miss Australia Quest) and early newsreels. Although made in 1984, it is still very relevant and of great historical value.

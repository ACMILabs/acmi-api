When Wukong returns with the food, he immediately perceives the evil nature of the disguised witch (When Wukong bats his eyelids quickly he can see through any disguise)and does away with her.<br />\nThe naïve Triptaka is angry that Wukong would mistreat an innocent girl, but when the food offering is uncovered, it&#8217;s found to contain not food, but disgusting creepy crawlies. Next they come across a little boy, who has lost his mother (supposedly the girl killed by Wukong). The child takes off swiftly with Triptaka and horse, but Wukong catches them up and engages the witch in a sky battle.<br />\nShe escapes yet again, summoning a copycat image to occupy Wukong and fight in her stead. Meanwhile she goes off to the temple to meet Triptaka in the guise of an old abbot. Again, Wukong returns to see through this disguise and attacks the abbot. Triptaka recites the chant that tightens the golden band around Wukong&#8217;s head, but Monkey perseveres through his torment to kill the daemon. At this point Triptaka is horrified and tries to drive Sun Wukong away.<br />\nSun Wukong travels the seas, returning to his isle, where he is king, only to find his domain has been ravaged, and only the old and babies survived. He summons the gods to clean up the mountain. The land is returned to a lush and verdant state, the monkeys thrive, and Monkey becomes a pitiful drunkard.<br />\nBack in the mountains, the fellowship is minutes away from calamity. Bajie goes off to find somewhere to rest for his master, but ends up discovering some long grass and falling asleep instead. Xiaseng and Triptaka give Bajie up for lost and find a monastery to stay in. It turns out to be a trap. Monkey hears his master is in trouble and infiltrates the witch&#8217;s cave in a clever disguise to defeat the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>The tale of  &#8220;Journey to the West&#8221; is long and has seen many representations in both literature and film. However this film is the classic tradition of animation representing the Monkey King which were developed early in China&#8217;s film history. The film is adapted particularly young audiences, but is often considered a viewing pleasure regardless of age.

However, due to the empire&#8217;s weakened state, China&#8217;s rulers Song Huizong (宋徽宗) and Song Qianzong (宋钦宗) have remained indecisive, unwilling to dedicate themselves to a prolonged campaign against these barbarians.<br />\nInstead, they send a delegation, headed by the lord of Kang, Zhao Gou (赵构), in the hope that he may somehow appease the belligerent horde. Far from accomplishing his task, Zhao Gou is taken hostage and held to ransom, shattering the last hopes of amnesty toward China&#8217;s devastated population. A Shaolin Kung Fu warrior Li Ma, known commonly as the &#8220;Flying Magic Mouse&#8221; (&#8220;飞天神鼠&#8221;), leads the local rebellion against the Jin in an effort to rescue the kidnapped envoy Zhao Gou. The rescue attempt ends up a failure, and all traces of Zhao Gou are lost.<br />\nIn order to search out Zhao Gou&#8217;s whereabouts, Li Ma enters the territories captured by the Jin and meets the Kung Fu Master Mai Tieshu and his two daughters. Tieshu is killed in a struggle with the Jin, but manages with his last breath to disclose the whereabouts of the captive emissary to Li Ma, telling his daughters, big sister and little sister Shan to aid him in the rescue mission. It wasn&#8217;t long before the two Mai sisters recognised the stalwart and courageous nature of Li Ma and fell deeply in love with him. During their journey the three were met with an seemingly impossible obstacle. They must leap across a cavernous gorge. The little sister decides to sacrifice herself so that the two can cross safely.<br />\nThough Li Ma and the elder sister risk their life in taking the leap, they are immediately ambushed with poison gas on the other side, and taken prisoner by the Jin. The Jin seek to convert Li Ma to their side so that he can aid them in assassinating the royal family. In order to avoid arousing the suspicions of the Jin, and to vouch safe the escape of Li Ma and the envoy, Mai Shan jumps onto the sword of Li Ma when he is ordered by the Jin to kill her.<br />\nWith Mai&#8217;s death and Li Ma&#8217;s dazzling exhibitions of martial prowess, the Jin are ecstatic that Li Ma has come over to their side, and drop their guard enough for Li Ma to smuggle Zhao Gou out of the stronghold. After returning to his palace, Zhao is proclaimed emperor, and though he offers to shower Li Ma with riches and titles, he politely declines so that he can search out the younger Mai sister, who had stayed behind at the gorge. Listening to the poisonous rumors, she believes that Li Ma had intentionally murdered her older sister, and deals her wrath out on him.<br />\nLi refuses to strike her and in turn is badly wounded by her kung fu, but in his punch-drunk state, utters the password that was exchanged in secret between the two sisters before they parted at the gorge. From that moment she realises her error in believing rumours over her own instincts, and after nursing Li Ma back to health, her hatred dissolves into unfaltering love and admiration. Meanwhile, isolated behind his palace walls, the newly appointed emperor falls prey to more rumors that Li Ma is organising an army to overthrow him and usurp the crown.<br />\nAlthough Li Ma&#8217;s true intention is to drive the Jin out of China, he realises the emperor is weak in character and has grown scared of Li. Inviting Li under the pretext of a royal audience, the emperor serves Li a deadly poison in his alcohol. Though Li’s skills in sensing poison alert him of the poison, he drinks out of loyalty when told to by the emperor. Meanwhile, Xiao Shan sister takes up command of the militia that Li had endeavoured to lead against the Jin.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nAs the tale is based on a romantic period novel, the story itself should not be taken as a reflection of fact, rather a nostalgic reshaping of what is commonly regarded as the tragic compromise of one of China&#8217;s most idealised periods of economic and cultural achievement. Like many historic and kung fu films, the tale is made relevant to contemporary audiences by drawing tacitly recognisable parallels between the decline of the Qing and Republic of China, followed by the revolutionary spirit of the People&#8217;s Republic, which are prophesied to deliver the country from the struggle victorious.<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald; December 15, 2010)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Magic flying mouse = Fei tian shen shu</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Qi Hai, Wang Wei and Pearl River Film Studio</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1990</p>", "description": "<p>The tale is based around the historical period of decline of the illustrious Northern Song Dynasty (Chinese: 北宋, 960–1127), which saw China&#8217;s borders fall under the military might of the armies of the Jin.

However, due to the empire&#8217;s weakened state, China&#8217;s rulers Song Huizong (宋徽宗) and Song Qianzong (宋钦宗) have remained indecisive, unwilling to dedicate themselves to a prolonged campaign against these barbarians.<br />\nInstead, they send a delegation, headed by the lord of Kang, Zhao Gou (赵构), in the hope that he may somehow appease the belligerent horde. Far from accomplishing his task, Zhao Gou is taken hostage and held to ransom, shattering the last hopes of amnesty toward China&#8217;s devastated population. A Shaolin Kung Fu warrior Li Ma, known commonly as the &#8220;Flying Magic Mouse&#8221; (&#8220;飞天神鼠&#8221;), leads the local rebellion against the Jin in an effort to rescue the kidnapped envoy Zhao Gou. The rescue attempt ends up a failure, and all traces of Zhao Gou are lost.<br />\nIn order to search out Zhao Gou&#8217;s whereabouts, Li Ma enters the territories captured by the Jin and meets the Kung Fu Master Mai Tieshu and his two daughters. Tieshu is killed in a struggle with the Jin, but manages with his last breath to disclose the whereabouts of the captive emissary to Li Ma, telling his daughters, big sister and little sister Shan to aid him in the rescue mission.

After the Taiping Rebellion failed, Liu only wants to have a quiet life with his daughter in the small town. However, a rich businessman, Mr. Yang came one day and asked Liu to duplicate a treasure of the town—Fan Zhongyan’s Travel Notes on Yueyang Building carved on twelve big wood pieces, placed in the Yueyang Building. Liu did that for Mr. Yang but later became suspicious of Yang’s purpose. He rushed to the Yueyang Building with his daughter only to find the authentic woodcarvings had been replaced by his work and the guard of the Building was killed. Liu reported this to the newly-appointed county magistrate, who ordered that all must be done to catch the thief. Liu, a kung-fu master himself, also tried to find the thief, but in the meantime, a couple of young ladies have been killed by darts that belonged to Liu. Liu was imprisoned, but was saved by his daughter together with a young man. They went to Mr. Yang’s boat and found the authentic woodcarving but were poisoned by an old man on the boat. It turned out that the thief was the county magistrate, who wanted to sell the woodcarving to foreigners. After a big fight, Liu with his daughter and the young man eventually killed the magistrate and Mr. Yang and saved the treasure.</p>\n<p>Fan Zhongyan’s (AD. 989-1052, Song Dynasty) &#8216;Travel Notes on Yueyang Building&#8217; is a very well-known prose and has a unique place in Chinese literature.

When Jean Thatcher (Irene Ware), daughter of Judge Thatcher (Samuel S. Hinds) is injured in a car accident, it is Dr Vollin who steps in and saves her life. However, the beautiful Jean becomes frightened of Vollin&#8217;s increasing attraction and advances towards her and pleads to her father to ask Vollin to leave her alone. Vollin&#8217;s rejection turns to revenge when by chance, an escaped killer, Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff), approaches the surgeon for a new face. Bateman unwittingly becomes a victim of Vollin&#8217;s sinister plan for the kidnap, torture and death of Jean and her fiance.

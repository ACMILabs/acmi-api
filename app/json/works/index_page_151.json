The incredible speed of the New York Stock Exchange&#8217;s Superdot electronic order routing system means that the Dow Jones can swing back and forth by more than 50 points in a matter of minutes. These conditions bring about a condition known as &#8220;data panic&#8221; a feeling of insecurity and anxiety that engulfs every transfer of digital information, from international trade to electronic banking.</p>\n<p>Data Panic combines images of computers, tape streamers, ATMs, terminals, workstations, printers, status indicators, traces and scans with computer animated icons, diagrams, pictograms, error messages, warnings, numbers, barcodes and binary digits. An advertorial style voice over narrates a non-sensical computer generated text interspersed with information technology advertising slogans.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:04:46:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Digital Art", "Experimental", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1235150, "name": "Ian Andrews", "creator_id": 9094, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1235151, "name": "Ian Andrews", "creator_id": 9094, "role": "visual artist", "role_id": 493, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD ROM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 109015, "acmi_id": "B2000282", "title": "Ian Andrews compile", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ian-andrews-compile", "creator_credit": "Ian Andrews", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1998-2001", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 109014, "acmi_id": "B1005530", "title": "Departure", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "departure", "creator_credit": "Ian Andrews", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 109145, "acmi_id": "B1005854", "title": "Equalibrium", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "equalibrium", "creator_credit": "Ian Andrews", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 01 JAN 2001", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, {"id": 114177, "acmi_id": "B1005853", "title": "Jumpcut", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jumpcut", "creator_credit": "Ian Andrews", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2001", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2403", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [53658]}, {"id": 114155, "acmi_id": "B1005343", "title": "This little pig went to market", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "this-little-pig-went-to-market", "creator_credit": "Sue Jarvis", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1970", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>In 1912, Dandy Hams and Bacon commenced at premises located in Dandenong, Melbourne.

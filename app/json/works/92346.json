Ilona takes a job in a greasy-spoon with questionable proprietors and Lauri, after selling the television and the car, indulges in a drinking binge which temporarily isolates him from his wife and home.

Timo Salminen&#8217;s subtle photography and the strong use of primary colours in the set design create a film memorable for its fine detail and its pathos.

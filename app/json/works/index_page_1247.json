The film traces his disastrous marriage to Nina (Glenda Jackson) and the platonic love he shared with his wealthy patron, Countess Von Meck, a woman whom he never met. &#8220;The Music Lovers&#8221; is a wildly extravagant film that defies the conservative cinematic traditions of classical biography. Russell was to continue developing his expressionist music biographies over the 1970&#8217;s and this film with its astounding cast and exquisite representation of pre-revolutionary Russia is a masterpiece. The music is conducted by Andre Previn and the script is by Melvyn Bragg, based on the book &#8220;Beloved Friend&#8221; by Catherine Drinker Bowen and Barbara Von Meck.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tchaikovsky, Peter Ilich, 1840-1893", "People&nbsp;→ Tchaikovsky, Peter Ilich, 1840-1893"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951139, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951140, "name": "Ken Russell", "creator_id": 9890, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55249", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951138, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39006", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1971", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1971"}], "labels": [22587], "external_references": [{"id": 2244, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1731265"}, {"id": 6091, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "72899"}]}, {"id": 91185, "acmi_id": "314271", "title": "The Music lesson", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-music-lesson", "creator_credit": "Celebrity Productions and Ub Iwerks", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1932", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1932-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Animated cartoon featuring Flip-the-frog.

A beauty of the silent screen she now remains isolated in her Los Angeles mansion, remembering the days when her fame was celebrated throughout the world. With a cynical, erudite script and some of Wilder&#8217;s best direction, &#8220;Sunset Boulevard&#8221; is a classic about the decay of Hollywood&#8217;s Golden Age. As the central character willing to prostitute himself in order to succeed, Holden is excellent but it is Swanson who gives one of the screen&#8217;s greatest performances as the demented, dangerous Norma.

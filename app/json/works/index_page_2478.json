For the filmmakers, the productions simply reflect the ambient pessimism, the fear of an impeding war and the tragedies already occuring in Spain. Some of the outstanding works of the late 1930s comprise Renoir&#8217;s &#8216;La bete humaine&#8217;<em>, &#8216;La grande illusion&#8217;</em>, &#8216;La regle du jeu&#8217;<em> and &#8216;La Marseillaise&#8217;</em>, a film about the French revolution financed by popular subscribtion. Naturally enough, 1940 saw French film production reduced to an unprecedented low of thirty-nine films. Many film personnel were lost to the industry. A few (such as composer Maurice Jaubert) were killed in action, but most simply fled the country. Directors Jean Renoir, Rene Clair and Max Ophuls began new careers in Hollywood, while Alexandre Trauner and a number of other Jewish technicians sought temporary safety in the south (the &#8216;free&#8217; zone was later invaded by Germany).

(&#8230;) Moreover, despite the desire of Joseph Goebbels, the German Propaganda Minister, that the French public should be fed a diet of empty and stupid films, a vibrant French film industry was a useful tool to placate the population and thus to deter resistance.

Constrained by censorship but also reflecting a national desire for an escape from the present, Occupation cinema has been characterised as a cinema of isolation and immobility, dominated by historical subjects, lyrical fantasies and remote settings.

Guan Jing is at first met with an amount of scepticism by the Captain of Police but gradually the Captain finds himself drawn into this story of intrigue and betrayal. Using flashbacks the audience is taken on a journey of discovery into the lives and emotions of Guan Jing, his mother and his father, superbly played by Tao Chung Wah, Si Ching Gao Wa and Ma Jing Wu respectively. The film does moves slowly, but the atmospheric cinematography of blues and misty whites, combined with an intense and involved story of murder, passion and family relationships will keep you fascinated to the end. Cinematography by Ho Yung.

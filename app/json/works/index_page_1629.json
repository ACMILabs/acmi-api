Through the frank and honest interviews and personal narratives contained in this documentary, we are given an unbiased, more intimate, perspective on the appalling everyday lives and struggles which took place in Lebanon during the war crisis where more than 150,000 people lost their lives, Christians and Muslims alike. Peace finally came to Beirut in 1990, although Israeli forces occupied southern Lebanon for many years on. A compelling and soul-searching documentary.

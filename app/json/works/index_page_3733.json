It is a comprehensive historical and analytical study of the movement which was a turning point in European and then world-wide thought on varied facets of design through its integration of notions of design, industry and functionality. This relationship created designs, buildings, art works and performance art synonymous with rationalised, sharp-edged and industry machine based ideals, which are closely analysed in this program from its development in the early 1900s to the struggles of the revolutionary aims of those involved during the Nazi regime and its contemporary influence. It presents a collection of archival footage, interviews with relevant experts as well as its students and teachers and the representation and discussion of an array of exemplary works and achieves a thorough outline of the Bauhaus school and its impact on modern design and architecture.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture - Germany", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture and history", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture, Modern - 20th century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Abstract", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 20th century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 20th century - History", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Expressionism (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Functionalism (Architecture)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Functionalism in art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Furniture design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Interior design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Design - Study and teaching", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interior design", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History - 1918-1933", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Design, Industrial", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Engineering design", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 4}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 878310, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878311, "name": "RM Arts", "creator_id": 22905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878312, "name": "Julia Cave", "creator_id": 29371, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 878309, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48549", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [30697], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65266, "acmi_id": "320046", "title": "Batu caves", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "batu-caves", "creator_credit": "Malayan Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Malaysia, 1961", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1961-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A group of school children explores Batu Caves in Kuala Lumpur and discover interesting examples of Malayan wild life.

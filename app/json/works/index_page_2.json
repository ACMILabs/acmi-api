Cutting a swathe through the bush is a dirt track lined with electricity transmission towers.</p>\n<p>On the mountain, we see children and adults learning to use their skis. There are lots of falls and numerous attempts to stand up again. There is some sled action on a type of sled typical to the era, and a big home-made metal sled with steering. Everyone herringbones back up the slope. Using the rope tow and ducking under the return rope .</p>\n<p>We see skiers ski in front of a building with the signage “Ski School”.</p>\n<p>There are lovely individual scenes of a man and a woman skiing past the camera dressed in the ski fashion of the day. A group of people practise their ski moves in front of the “Falls Creek Comfort Station”.</p>\n<p>Colourfully dressed children navigate the ski slopes, and an elderly man dressed in a coat and feathered trilby-style hat tries his hand at skiing.</p>\n<p>We see a lovely scene of the family as they take a break from skiing to have a picnic sitting in the snow. They have their thermos flask, sandwiches, and cordial.</p>\n<p>The film shows people being towed uphill and past a building with “ski lodge” signage.</p>\n<p>There are various scenes of skiers congregating together on the slopes and wide shots of them skiing in across and down the slopes.</p>\n<p>The final part of the film shows what could be accommodation Bogong Village. The village was originally constructed by the Victorian State Electricity Utility Commissions (SEC) from the 1930s and 1950s to house workers on the Kiewa Hydro Electric scheme.</p>\n<p>We see historic vehicles c1950/ 1960 with Victorian registration plates beginning with HEW: 4, parked in the street at the front of the houses. There are images of people as they walk down the street with the mountains in the background.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of fashion, ski wear, and ski techniques in the 60s. Ski Lodge architecture, Bogong Village architecture, vehicles and Falls Creek and Bogong Village landscapes are also a great historic reflection of the era.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:02:00:00 Title “Falls Creek 1960”<br />\n00:00:32:00 Snow-capped mountain with tree covered slopes in the foreground<br />\n00:01:26:00 A young boy struggles to get to his feet after a fall<br />\n00:01:35:00 A young boy stands with his skis over his shoulder in the snow<br />\n00:02:09:00 A young boy plays in the snow beside his stocks.

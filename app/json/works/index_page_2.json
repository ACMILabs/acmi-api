The film contains three distinct sections: the first focusing on the principles for lifting heavy objects; the second showing different methods for lifting patients in the hospital; and the third showing methods for manoeuvring heavy loads such as shovelling material and pushing a trolley.</p>\n<p>The first section includes animated sections showing the anatomy of the spine and the different types of back injury, including slipped disks, muscle and ligament strain. It then outlines the steps for lifting a heavy load, focusing on a truck driver loading various objects onto the tray of his vehicle.</p>\n<p>The second section is directed at hospital staff, as an instructional video for lifting patients correctly. It shows methods of lifting patients up in bed, into a wheelchair and into a bath. Of particular note is the athletic wear (leotards and tracksuits) of the period worn by the nurses and patients in the demonstrations.</p>\n<p>The third section shows methods of manual handling in everyday life with correct posture and stability, including shovelling material; pushing a trolley; and lifting a box into the back seat of a car.</p>\n<p>A Repatriation Commission Film<br />\nConsultant: David Ferguson, Associate Professor in occupational health, the University of Sydney</p>\n<p>The colour is faded throughout the film.</p>\n<p>Please note: As this is an archival work, the content does not reflect current practice or standards.

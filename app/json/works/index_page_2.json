Maybe they just need to smile more. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a huge swath of the internet came out in support of Tame’s directness – with stills from the footage shared across social media – likening her demeanour to their feelings towards the Coalition government. </p>\n<p>Throughout her tenure as Australian of the Year, Tame has been vocal about the government’s handling of sexual abuse allegations and its treatment of survivors. In April of 2021, when asked about Scott Morrison’s <a href=\"https://www.mamamia.com.au/brittany-higgins-scott-morrison/\">‘as a father’</a> response to rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins – which some believe he didn’t take seriously until <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-criticised-for-invoking-his-daughters-in-response-to-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations/f749bed4-feb5-4903-9338-0d03b10d795f\">“viewing it from the lens of being a father of daughters”</a> – Tame responded: “It shouldn’t take children to have a conscience. And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience.” Like this most recent interaction with the Prime Minister, that clip also went viral on the internet, helping solidify Tame’s position as a courageous advocate for sexual assault survivors and a moral champion at a time when many see Australia’s leaders as lacking both courage and morals.</p>\n<p>As Imogen Champagne writes in <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/01/27/grace-tame-side-eye-peter-van-onselen/\"><i>Crikey</i></a>:, &#8220;Conservatives have been trying to silence Grace Tame all year. Now she’s finally given them silence and they can&#8217;t shut up about it.&#8221;</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>You’d be hard pressed to find a woman who hasn’t been told to smile when she obviously doesn’t want to.

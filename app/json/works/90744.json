Rich in rare photographic family portraits, archival images of her homes, farms and environment, her exquisite watercolours and famous illustrations, this is a complete biography. Narrated by Lynn Redgrave and written by Judy Taylor, the story of a remarkable and talented woman emerges. Best known as an English author and illustrator, primarily for her unique children&#8217;s books, her family origins were in Lancashire, where cotton mills and calico printing created the family wealth. She was born (28/7/1866) and raised in affluent isolation on the edge of central London, rural Kensington, in late Victorian England. Not sent to school because she was considered sickly and educated by a series of governesses until the birth of a sibling, she developed an observance and love of nature at a very early age, coupled with a natural talent for drawing. Her nursery floor was inhabited by all sorts of creatures brought home to London from summer holidays in Scotland. She cared for, observed and loved them as friends and spent much time drawing them. Her first book, &#8220;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&#8221;, was based on an illustrated letter about her pet rabbit, sent to her governess&#8217;s son. Her lawyer father&#8217;s influence was strong. A talented amateur photographer who did preparatory studies for the painter Millet, he admired and avidly collected original works of illustrators of the day. She became financially independent in her 20&#8217;s through her children&#8217;s books and remained the dutiful Victorian daughter into her 40&#8217;s, caring for her demanding parents in London but escaping for intervals to her sheep farm in the Lake District. Here she met her husband, virtually stopped publishing and became a successful sheep farmer and environmentalist, holding and managing over 4000 acres, 17 farms, at the time of her death in 1944.

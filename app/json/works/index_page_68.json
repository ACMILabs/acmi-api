The film is a tribute to the work of the Auxiliary Fire Service, described through the events of one-day activities. The story unfolds without effort from the early morning assembly of crew at the fire station, through the routine of the day, to the fighting of a blazing warehouse at night.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Great Britain - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Fires", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History", "History&nbsp;→ History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1864317, "name": "Stewart McAllister", "creator_id": 13930, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1864315, "name": "Humphrey Jennings", "creator_id": 14195, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1864314, "name": "Ian Dalrymple", "creator_id": 13923, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1655499", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1864313, "name": "Crown Film Unit", "creator_id": 12727, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1864318, "name": "William Alwyn", "creator_id": 74656, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1864316, "name": "C M Pennington-Richards", "creator_id": 14970, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "23160", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1943", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1943"}], "labels": [7030], "external_references": [{"id": 112, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1418983"}, {"id": 4162, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "84656"}]}, {"id": 67306, "acmi_id": "003456", "title": "Explosives: the two metre lifeline", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "explosives-the-two-metre-lifeline", "creator_credit": "David Plummer, Donald Crombie, Milton Ingerson and South Australian Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1974", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this 1974 film, the use of comedy and narrative drama are employed to demonstrate the correct handling of explosives and detonators.

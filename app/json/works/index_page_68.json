Hall decides to travel back to 1937 to recover a message that Fuller has left for him in the system and hopefully identify the real killer. As the principal characters travel through time, they struggle to maintain their 1930s identities and face the danger of ruining their creation by exposing the game. &#8220;The Thirteenth floor&#8221; is a science fiction thriller that mimics the technical babble and mind-bending logic of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; and &#8220;eXistenZ&#8221;, without ever really managing to achieve the accomplishments of those finer examples of the genre. The film, stylish in its recreation of the 1930s era and the computer saturated sleekness of the 90s, melds noirish aesthetics, romance, murder mystery and sci-fi adventuring.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Time travel in motion pictures", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Virtual reality"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-13th-floor", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963090, "name": "Centropolis Entertainment", "creator_id": 72365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963091, "name": "Ute Emmerich", "creator_id": 80501, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963092, "name": "Roland Emmerich", "creator_id": 72381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963093, "name": "Marco Weber", "creator_id": 80502, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963094, "name": "Josef Rusnak", "creator_id": 80503, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963089, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51518", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33310], "external_references": [{"id": 1173, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q630289"}, {"id": 6309, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "1090"}]}, {"id": 79553, "acmi_id": "300506", "title": "The Third man", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-third-man", "creator_credit": "London Film Productions and Carol Reed", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1949", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1949-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A lucky combination of talents gave this romantic thriller, set in war-torn Vienna, an almost poetic quality and an excitement which has kept it vivid.

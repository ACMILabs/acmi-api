Includes commentary from local identities Willis Connolly, Les Haine, Campbell Husten and Mrs Thompson. &#8220;Power makers&#8221; (dir. Lee Robinson): Looks at a typical day in the life of four &#8220;power makers&#8221; - workers at the Yallourn power station. We are shown the important work performed by dredger crews, train drivers, boiler hands, turbine attendants and other tradesmen. Features workers George Fisher, Jack Morris, Rowley Paul and Frank Robertson. &#8220;Behind the switch&#8221;: Every switch is a demand for instant electricity. The Latrobe Valley brown coal provides four-fifths of electricity. Shows work at Yallourn and Morwell and progress on the new Hazelwood power station. Use of electricity in industry, at home, for transport, and entertainment. Increasing demands are a measure of the State&#8217;s growth and rate of development. Emphasis on ability to meet future demands.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hazelwood Power Station (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Latrobe River Valley (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Morwell (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Yallourn (Vic.)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Fossil fuels", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ State Electricity Commission of Victoria", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Power resources - Australia", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Power-plants", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Power-plants - Victoria", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ State Electricity Commission of Victoria", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Electric power", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Electricity", "Places&nbsp;→ Hazelwood Power Station (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Latrobe River Valley (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Morwell (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Yallourn (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3082521, "name": "Shan Benson", "creator_id": 11902, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120303630", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082519, "name": "Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "creator_id": 11967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082520, "name": "SECV", "creator_id": 32479, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

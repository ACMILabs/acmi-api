Cast includes Judi Farr (as Florence) and Felicity Price (as the young Florence).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Designers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Interior design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Textile design", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interior design", "People&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2036713, "name": "Nicholas Beauman", "creator_id": 87191, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036712, "name": "Katherine Thomson", "creator_id": 81376, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3194044", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036711, "name": "Gillian Armstrong", "creator_id": 214, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036710, "name": "Charles Hannah", "creator_id": 81375, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036709, "name": "Sue Clothier", "creator_id": 30348, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036708, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036707, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036706, "name": "Becker Entertainment", "creator_id": 81374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036705, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2036717, "name": "Felicity Price", "creator_id": 81381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036716, "name": "Judi Farr", "creator_id": 81380, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036715, "name": "Paul Grabowsky", "creator_id": 81379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036714, "name": "John Radel", "creator_id": 81378, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036704, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53730", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [35090], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95583, "acmi_id": "319766", "title": "The Floating Brothel", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-floating-brothel", "creator_credit": "Mark Lewis, Sonja Armstrong, Essential Viewing, Film Australia and National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2006", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2006-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on the 2001 book of the same name by Sian Rees, &#8220;The Floating Brothel&#8221; tells the story of some of the women transported to Australia on the convict ship The Lady Juliana in 1789.

Interviews with Phillip Noyce, Rolf De Heer, Marcia Langton, Gary Foley, Jack Thompson, and others, as well as with Gulpilil, are interspersed with clips from films in which the actor has appeared.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians in motion pictures", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Australia - History", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social conditions", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "People&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2036655, "name": "David Gulpilil", "creator_id": 60298, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036654, "name": "Darlene Johnson", "creator_id": 8650, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036653, "name": "Tom Zubrycki", "creator_id": 20426, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2036652, "name": "Jotz Productions", "creator_id": 23824, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2036663, "name": "David Gulpilil", "creator_id": 60298, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036662, "name": "Jack Thompson", "creator_id": 72924, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036661, "name": "Gary Foley", "creator_id": 72039, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036660, "name": "Marcia Langton", "creator_id": 73345, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036659, "name": "Rolf De Heer", "creator_id": 10241, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036658, "name": "Phil Noyce", "creator_id": 11119, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036657, "name": "Robert Humphreys", "creator_id": 80488, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036656, "name": "Darlene Johnson", "creator_id": 8650, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2036651, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51480", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33289], "external_references": []}]}

Also available on VHS [303086].</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Jedda, Charles Chauvel&#8217;s last feature film and Australia&#8217;s first in colour, is the story of a teenage Aboriginal girl who has been raised by a white woman, and finds herself drawn to Marbuck, a full-blooded Aborigine who comes to the station for work. The film falls readily into two halves. The first details Jedda&#8217;s upbringing and her emotional turmoil as to her identity, which is solved by Jedda herself, when the call of her blood leads her into the physical and psychological world of her people.

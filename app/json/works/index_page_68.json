Once escaped, the rats made a home for themselves in Thorn Valley. It was predicted that one day the forces of NIMH would rise again and the son of Jonathan Brisby would save them; the destiny of rats lies with Timmy Brisby. Feeling the pressure to be the hero his father was, Timmy begins his journey with Jeremy the crow where he is placed under the tutelage of Mr Ages and fellow elders who equip him with the tools to face his destiny. A female rat called Jenny makes it to the village and implores them to return to NIMH with her and save the rats from the evil Doctor Valentine. The council decides against helping her however, and when Timmy discovers elder brother Martin is a prisoner at NIMH, he and Jenny decide to save the rats themselves. Made for television 16 years after the original and features musical numbers. Features the voices of Dom DeLuise, Eric Idle, Ralph Macchio, William H. Macy and Hynden Walch.

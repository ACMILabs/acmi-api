Stewart Kane, played by Irish actor Gabrielle Byrne, goes fishing with friends to a remote spot; when he and his friends find a young girl&#8217;s mutilated body they continue with their trip, reporting the crime upon their return. Such callousness makes Claire (Laura Linney) question her marriage and her husband&#8217;s humanity and she is drawn into a web of intrigue and ethical dilemmas. Expanding upon Carver&#8217;s original text, Lawrence examines Aboriginal rites and ceremonies and places, central to the narrative, the uncomfortable relationship between the black and white communities.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Rites and ceremonies", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians in motion pictures", "Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 5}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jindabyne", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1932483, "name": "Ray Lawrence", "creator_id": 9735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1932482, "name": "Catherine Jarmar", "creator_id": 37740, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1932481, "name": "April Films", "creator_id": 37739, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53692", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [35055], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95190, "acmi_id": "319242", "title": "The Tracker [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-tracker-dvd-a", "creator_credit": "Rolf De Heer, Julie Ryan, South Australian Film Corporation and Vertigo Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in the Australian outback in 1922 and filmed on location in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia, &#8220;The Tracker&#8221; tells the story of three white men and an indigenous tracker in pursuit of a fugitive.

He answers to The Fanatic (Gary Sweet), a cruel bigot who is hell bent on catching The Fugitive, an aboriginal man accused of murdering a white woman. The Follower (Damon Gameau), is a naive young colonial policeman new to the job while The Veteran (Grant Page) is a world weary man whose kind nature is overridden by what he must do and how society expects him to treat blacks.

When an interrogation of some bush blacks turns into a massacre, the balance of power shifts and assumed notions of truth and justice are thrown into question.

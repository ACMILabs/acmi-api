This became one of pop culture&#8217;s most discussed questions when this pilot for David Lynch&#8217;s &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; was first aired on television. Kyle MacLachlan plays FBI agent Dale Cooper who comes into the sleepy small-town Twin Peaks to investigate Laura Palmer&#8217;s murder and discovers that underneath the banal facade the town hides a labyrinth of perversity and evil. As with &#8220;Eraserhead&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Velvet&#8221;, Lynch uses macabre humour to expose the psychological neurosis and psychosis that underlie the supposed normality of middle-class America. Both wickedly funny and savagely shocking, &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; radicalised the potential of the TV mini-series by introducing generic forms and psychological content that had previously been isolated to independent cinema. This is the initial pilot episode but it also stands alone as a feature film. &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; is a soap opera and police drama as reinterpreted by the leading surrealist of contemporary cinema.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sudden death - Psychological aspects", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoses", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sudden death - Psychological aspects", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 873271, "name": "Lynch/Frost Productions", "creator_id": 4060, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 873272, "name": "Frost Productions", "creator_id": 18672, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 873273, "name": "David J.

The film&#8217;s themes of nostalgia and loss are cleverly realised in its complex editing structure which jumps back and forth through time, (this being &#8220;The Limey&#8217;s&#8221; most obvious nod to &#8220;Point blank&#8221;). Soderbergh however is also trading on a different kind of nostalgia by showcasing the acting talents of Terence Stamp, this loving homage accumulates in a scene from Ken Loach&#8217;s &#8220;Poor cow&#8221; (1968), (which starred a very young Stamp), a cherished film memory for Wilson and the audience alike. Cast includes: Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzman, Barry Newman, Joe Dallesandro.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-limey", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961374, "name": "Artisan Pictures", "creator_id": 34560, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961375, "name": "John Hardy", "creator_id": 77367, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961376, "name": "Scott Kramer", "creator_id": 80020, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961377, "name": "Steven Soderbergh", "creator_id": 68097, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q103917", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50371", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32348], "external_references": [{"id": 1042, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1382199"}, {"id": 6005, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10388"}]}, {"id": 90268, "acmi_id": "313203", "title": "The Lightship", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-lightship", "creator_credit": "CBS Productions, Bill Benenson Productions, Bill Beneson, Moritz Borman and Jerzy Skolimowski", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1985", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on an allegorical novella by Siegfried Lenz, this moody, carefully crafted suspense by Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski (Moonlighting, The Shout) is set in 1955 aboard an isolated U.S. Coast Guard lightship anchored in dangerous waters off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia.

out of every aperture.  Shoes and dresses, pots and pans, cutlery, pillows, blankets and plates journey in two directions simultaneously, some disappearing into the distance never to return, others appearing across all four screens in the installation. The larger objects fade up like apparitions, disappear and then reappear in strange locations, breaking all logic that is guiding this imaginary world. The slow drift of these household objects around the four screens is uncanny. While their journey suggests that the natural phenomenon of air is present, there is also a sense of airlessness; a claustrophobic, almost heavily scented environment. Despite sharing an energy force within the virtual environment, these objects are estranged – for they have lost their domestic relationship with one another. The sounds of bumps, collisions and muffled shuffles emerging from the interior of the house underscores the mystery of this scene.

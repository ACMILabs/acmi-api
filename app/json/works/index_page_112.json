At times genuinely terrifying, this film is somewhat dated, particularly in the special effects department, but interestingly was released just a year before Spielberg&#8217;s hugely successful &#8220;Poltergeist&#8221;, with which it shares many major themes. Hershey puts in a fine performance as an imperilled woman whose ordinary (if bleak) life is put under siege by forces beyond her comprehension. Although the film takes a somewhat dissatisfying turn mid-way through, it remains an interesting example of a science versus spirit movie and should prove a boon to horror buffs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hallucinations and illusions", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology - Research", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Demoniac possession", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientists"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-entity", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962678, "name": "American Cinema Productions", "creator_id": 35430, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962679, "name": "Pelleport Investors", "creator_id": 35431, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962680, "name": "Harold Schneider", "creator_id": 52980, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962681, "name": "Sidney J.

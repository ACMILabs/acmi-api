Taught by action stars but inspired by classic Chinese texts like Lao Zi&#8217;s <i>Dao De Jing</i>, he questions whether these life lessons are genuinely useful.

Taught by action stars but inspired by classic Chinese texts like Lao Zi&#8217;s &#8220;Dao De Jing&#8221;, he questions whether these life lessons are genuinely useful.

Jenny (Cynthia Kaplan) is married to Will who works in the mill and wants to try and save his job by siding with both management and the workers, but ends up by finding himself on the outer anyway. Jenny is unemployed but makes half-hearted attempts in applying for work, most times being put down or humiliated for her lack of skills or experience. Bored and restless, Jenny finds satisfaction in the company of June (Sonja Sohn), her next door African American neighbour who is an athlete and up and coming college student. Jenny and June&#8217;s relationship blossoms into an affair of secret conversations and erotic encounters, providing a release for Jenny&#8217;s sense of futility and hopelessness and allowing her to explore her sexuality.

Reichman has given this film a cinema verite style and through her direction, the film has retained an essential quality of realism and truism. Cinematography by Steven Giuliano.

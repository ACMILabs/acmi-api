Instead of hands, the boy has sharp shears of metal. Until his rescue by a kindly Avon lady who takes him home to the pastel paradise of suburbia, Edward lives alone in darkness. &#8220;Edward Scissorhands&#8221; is more than a fairy tale by masterful director Tim Burton. This is a satire/allegory which is both funny and moving. Johhny Depp as Edward is a gentle creature full of pathos, yet dignified; much less a monster than the fickle humans who at first embrace him and then seek to destroy him. Dianne Weist stars as Avon Lady Peg, and Winona Ryder as her daughter, Kim.

Though Zahra is distraught, Ali convinces her not to tell their father, who is already burdened with the responsibilities of supporting a family, including a sick wife, on a meagre wage, and is prone to react violently and irrationally.

It clearly posits the children as the hope of the future - Ali is the top student in his class as well as being physically superior and mature, whilst Zahra is virtuous and innocent.

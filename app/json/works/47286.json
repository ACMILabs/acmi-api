The style was first released by Sony in 1967 and had arrived in Australia by the early 1970s.</p>\n<p>The Portapak was an important development in technology, enabling a new level of portability (the camera and recorder were battery-powered and self-contained). It enabled videos to be captured and played back more quickly, removing the development of film from the process.</p>\n<p>It was influential in the development of video art, guerrilla television and activism, coinciding with the countercultural movement’s response to the influence of television and mass media.</p>\n<p>In the US, collectives such as the Raindance Foundation and Videofreex used the Portapak to create alternative broadcast channels. In Australia, video access centres such as Open Channel and Paddington Video Access Centre (later Metro Screen) were established and provided equipment, training and community access to young filmmakers.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>National Portable Video Camera WV-3085</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>National Panasonic</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Japan, c. 1974</p>", "description": "<p>National Panasonic Portapak WV 3085 camera, with lead to connect to National Panasonic NV 3085 reel-to-reel sound recorder unit.

The notion of preconceived ideas of Aboriginal art is discussed as well as the non-stereotypical aboriginality represented in the urban artist&#8217;s work where mythical, cultural and environmental heritage is referred to, but situated politically as a confrontation of past and present issues effecting indigenous Australians. Through the interviews with the artists and critics of their work the autobiographical nature of the art is evoked, underlining both the personal and broad social relevance of the art to contemporary Aboriginal experience. It is thorough documentary on the broad spectrum of work being produced that also raises the key issues of Aboriginal ownership of imagery and the question of Aboriginal copyright.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Art, Aboriginal Australian", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Bancroft, Bronwyn", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australian artists", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Collectors and collecting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Aboriginal Australian", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 20th century - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Bancroft, Bronwyn", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Politics in art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Women artists", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australian prisoners", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Copyright law - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politics in art - Australia", "People&nbsp;→ Bancroft, Bronwyn", "People&nbsp;→ Foley, Fiona", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2297062, "name": "Amanda Hickey", "creator_id": 79525, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361008", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2297058, "name": "Special Broadcasting Service Corporation", "creator_id": 30089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2297055, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48545", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [30693]}]}

Hold: Vessel 1 will change in time as time changes the environments it reflects.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Audio Format/Stereo"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["mixed media, interactive video, projection, glass, colour and sound"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1913306, "name": "Lynette Wallworth", "creator_id": 7138, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "518", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [47750]}, {"id": 71312, "acmi_id": "322442", "title": "Paddle to the sea", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "paddle-to-the-sea", "creator_credit": "Bill Mason, Julian Biggs and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1966", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1966-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 48206, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7123355"}], "brief_description": "<p>A children&#8217;s odyssey, from the story by Holling C.

Troy Hurtubise&#8217;s obsession was given birth to over 10 years ago when he was confronted by a grizzly bear whilst trekking alone in the Canadian wilderness. Under an extraordinary set of circumstances the grizzly spares Troy&#8217;s life and so an obsession is born. The task Troy set himself is to build a suit that will withstand an attack from a grizzly bear. The mission is to again confront &#8216;Old Man&#8217; (Troy&#8217;s name for the grizzly) whilst wearing the suit to continue his &#8220;close quarter bear research&#8221;.

The film begins with an amnesiac John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakening in a bathtub, with no recollection of why he&#8217;s there and a tiny bloodspot on his forehead. Other people around him seem to know more about John&#8217;s memory than he does, including his estranged wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), mad genius Dr Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) and sympathetic policeman Frank Bumstead (William Hurt). John&#8217;s investigation into regaining his memory is set against a bleak film noir inspired background where the sun never rises, as well as a murder investigation into a series of deaths involving prostitutes (of which Murdoch is a suspect) and a former policeman (Colin Friels) who seems to have gone mad investigating the case. Both John&#8217;s investigation into his past and the police investigation into the murders are intricately involved with The Strangers - a band of gothic looking people who have a collective memory and have the ability to alter the physical world via a process called Turning - a capability that John possesses. The Strangers are driven by the need to replicate humans and ensure The Strangers survival, begging the question, what is it that makes us human?

Like the original, the plot is a daring heist of several casinos in one grand night. Danny Ocean takes the lead role of the film as the gang chief and mastermind of the scheme. His unruly crew consist of Rusty (best buddy), Reuben (moneyman), Frank (croupier), Linus (pickpocket), Saul (aging con artist), Basher (explosives expert), Dell (technical expert), Virgil and Turk (two daft brothers providing comic relief) and Yen (acrobat). Ocean fails to tell the crew that his target (and motive) is to sting the new boyfriend of his ex-wife and owner of the casinos that will be hit. Soderbergh plays &#8220;Ocean&#8217;s eleven&#8221; largely for laughs, rather than with any tension typical of a caper film and with a touch of romance thrown in for good measure.

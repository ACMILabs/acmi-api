Whilst this re-edited film was half the length of the original, Ive&#8217;s director Lyn Maplestone created greater impact by lingering on the sights and sounds of logging trees in the Jarrah and Karri forests. The film focuses on the atmosphere of the forest as it was irrevocably changed by the axe and saw of the loggers.

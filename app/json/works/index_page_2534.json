Despite his comic buffoonery, when it comes to the crunch his highly honed martial arts skills save the day. Like the previous films in the trilogy (&#8220;The Fearless Hyena&#8221; (1979), &#8220;The Young Master&#8221; (1980)), &#8216;Dragon Lord&#8217; is set in the countryside during the late Quing period. Chan plays the son of a wealthy man. He and his childhood friend spend their time participating in sporting events and competing to woo the village beauty. His carefree life takes a more serious turn when he stumbles upon a sinister villain who is attempting to smuggle priceless antiquities out of the country. The film features thrilling sporting sequences, a suspenseful rooftop encounter with a group of spear-wielding baddies, a playful acrobatic fight in an art gallery, and a show-stopping twenty minute final brawl that is a classic of Hong Kong action cinema. While not considered one of Chan&#8217;s best films, the over-the-top comic action sequences, featuring crazy stunts and rapid editing he pioneered in &#8216;Dragon Lord&#8217; had a major impact on the subsequent development of Hong Kong action cinema.

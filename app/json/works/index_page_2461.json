Upon his return to Jamaica Marley soon turned to Rastafarianism - a specifically Jamaican movement, banned under Colonial rule, that married black consciousness with spiritual awareness. Being a Rastafarian revolutionised Marley&#8217;s music and politics, making him a powerful force for the black human rights cause, as well as a political ally and danger to the leaders of the country. This documentary includes interviews with Rita Marley (his widow), Lee Scratch Perry, The Wailers, lovers, producers, collaborators, friends and colleagues in the music industry, politicians and family members. Contains archival footage of Marley, film clips, interviews and live shows. Songs include: Rebel music, Judge not, Soul rebel, Corner store, Put it on, One love, Stir it up and Its alright.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "French", "German", "Italian", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jamaica - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rastafari movement - Jamaica", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Africa - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans - Civil rights", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Jamaica - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rastafari movement - Jamaica", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Jamaica - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Marley, Bob, 1945-1981", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Reggae music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Wailers (Reggae group)", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Marley, Bob, 1945-1981", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Wailers (Reggae group)", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2239868, "name": "Jeremy Marre", "creator_id": 12980, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6181664", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239864, "name": "Antelope Films", "creator_id": 25018, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239865, "name": "Thirteen", "creator_id": 20236, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086135", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239866, "name": "WNET (Television station : New York, N.Y.)", "creator_id": 12342, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2239863, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

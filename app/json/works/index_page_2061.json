The program looks at shifts in museum policy and the efforts by groups such as the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre to have these remains repatriated from overseas institutions back to Australia for proper burial by their descendants.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Attitudes", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Tasmania", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Sacred sites (Australian Aboriginal)", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Evolution (Biology)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Bones", "History&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Evolution (Biology)", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - History", "People&nbsp;→ Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2177407, "name": "Chris Oxley", "creator_id": 79170, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360788", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2177403, "name": "Channel 4, U K", "creator_id": 31494, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337026", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2177398, "name": "Laurel Productions", "creator_id": 31493, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222950", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2177394, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46684", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [29054]}, {"id": 89597, "acmi_id": "312409", "title": "Darrow = Clarence Darrow: attorney for the damned", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "darrow-clarence-darrow-attorney-for-the-damned", "creator_credit": "Richard Heus, Stephen Stept, John David Coles, Heus-Stept Productions and KCET (Television station : Los Angeles, Calif.)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Born in 1857 in Ohio, Clarence Darrow was to become one of the most famous and highly recognised lawyers in America, most notably through the defence of Eugene Debs during the Pullman railroad strike (1894), the Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb murder trial (1924) and the John Scopes &#8220;Monkey trial&#8221; (1925).

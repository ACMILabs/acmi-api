The transitions from one book cover to another intensify the viewer&#8217;s awareness of the power of the gaze. The heroine pivots and turns, knowing she is watched by the predator male (always lurking behind her), as she also seduces the paperback consumer. The viewer&#8217;s gaze is held captive as she beckons, sashaying from left to right, right to left, with every gesture emphasising the formulaic signifiers of beauty: the button nose, the downcast eyes, and the lips - poised, pensive, tremulous, waiting.</p>\n<p>Always the waiting. This &#8216;waiting&#8217; is the basic form - the topic requiring a morphology - of romantic desire. The lover waits for the return of a half-hallucinated, half-remembered state when all existence seemed to be suffused in unconditional devotion and satisfaction. Perhaps this perfect state is remembered from infancy or from an interlude before a crushing betrayal or disappointment, when bliss seemed real and within reach.

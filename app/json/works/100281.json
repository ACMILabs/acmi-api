It has been listed as the highest selling single computer model of all time – over 17million units were sold worldwide. The C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. With support for multicolour sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware. Because of this, the C64 was often used as a home gaming console, with accessories such as datasettes and gaming joysticks.<br />\nThe Commodore 64 holds a unique place in the history of video games. Institutions such as the National Museum of American History and the Science Museum London also hold Commodore 64 consoles in their collections to highlight the impact and significance the C64 had on computing and home video games.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Commodore 64 Console without joysticks or power cords<br />\nSerial Number WGB 28483</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Foyer&nbsp;→ Entry&nbsp;→ FSF-03.

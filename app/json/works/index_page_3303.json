Dwindling numbers of church-goers has caused the Catholic Church to take desperate measures to ensure its survival, beginning the &#8216;Catholicism Wow&#8217; campaign, in an attempt to boost the church&#8217;s profile. Renegade angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck), banished from Heaven following an argument with God and forced to spend eternity in Wisconsin, discover a loophole in dogmatic law that will allow them to re-enter Heaven, by passing through the arch of a New Jersey Cathedral. Unfortunately God- who happens to be a woman- has failed to return from her monthly visit to earth to play arcade games. As a result the fate of the human race relies on the last descendent of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who has lost her faith. Metatron (Alan Rickman), a Seraphim and the voice of God, informs Bethany of her responsibilities and that she will be assisted by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and his hetro-life partner Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith).

Montag (Oskar Werner) burns books for a living. He and his wife Linda live in an opulent suburban house where she takes pills to calm her while she interacts with the giant TV screen on her wall. Montag is bored but unaware of the nature of his alienation until he meets a radical schoolteacher on a train. Soon he picks up a forbidden book and begins reading. Under-rated on its original release, the film now impresses with a visually experimental colour palette and stark futurist sets which imaginatively represent the landscape of a technological fascism.

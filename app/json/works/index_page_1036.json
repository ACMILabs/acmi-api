In addition, the rising competition of other forms of entertainment also stole the attention of Chinese crowds away from films.

The Chinese film industry tried to build a bridge to invite the world outside to come in contact with local Chinese films.  The 1980s era was recognized as the “Golden Age” of Chinese-dubbed movies.  In the mid 1980s, as China opened up their policies and pushed for reform after the Cultural Revolution, the country imported and dubbed around 1,300 movies from around the globe.

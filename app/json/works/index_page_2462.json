A large international cast provides substance to this film, including Linda Hunt, Sian Phillips, Dean Stockwell, Jurgen Prochnow, Patrick Stewart, Sting and Freddie Jones.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:11:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Life on other planets"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1990678, "name": "David Lynch", "creator_id": 4092, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2071", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990677, "name": "Raffaella De Laurentiis", "creator_id": 86566, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q512184", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990676, "name": "De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 23143, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3704004", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42505", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [25779]}, {"id": 86287, "acmi_id": "307946", "title": "Two women = La Ciociara", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "two-women-la-ciociara", "creator_credit": "Vittorio De Sica, Carlo Ponti, Cocinor, Compagnia Cinematografica Champion Films Marceau and Societe Generale de Cinematographie", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1960", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45868, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q128761"}], "brief_description": "<p>The story centers on a widow (Sophia Loren) who runs a tiny grocery store in Rome.

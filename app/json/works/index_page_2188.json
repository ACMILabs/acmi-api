Cast also includes Sony Chiba, Laura Gemser, Frank Converse, James Earl Jones, Mako, Mayumi Atano, Timothy Murphy, Michael Starr.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Japan - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Foreign relations - Japan", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History - To 1868", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960502, "name": "Tom Kotani", "creator_id": 33834, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960501, "name": "Arthur Rankin Jnr", "creator_id": 20373, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960500, "name": "Bass", "creator_id": 33833, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960499, "name": "Rankin-Bass Productions", "creator_id": 20371, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960498, "name": "Trident Films", "creator_id": 15359, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19578, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/92X5Vp70inzQ81xrCFstPeP9lj2.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Bushido blade (Tom Kotani) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 797, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49840", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [31880]}, {"id": 90067, "acmi_id": "47256", "title": "The Burning question: a fire protection film (B&W)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-burning-question-a-fire-protection-film-bw", "creator_credit": "Eric Morris, Geoffrey Thompson, Council of Fire and Accident Underwriters and Cine Service", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1971", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Modern fire precautions, showing equipment used in Australia.

Alan Bates (who won a Tony Award for this role on the stage) is outstanding as Butley, a university lecturer whose life is falling apart. This day-in-the-life drama, set in his work place (a small college office) gradually unfolds as his life unravels. Butley&#8217;s sharp verbal wit is relentless as is his need for a smoke and stiff drink - especially as his wife (Susan Engel) has left him for another man. His workmate and previous flatmate Joey (Richard O&#8217;Callaghan) is leaving him too to be with his boyfriend Reg (Michael Byrne).

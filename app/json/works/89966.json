The earth of the future is a decaying dystopia, populated by gladiator cyborgs, ruthless hunter-warriors, and anyone else unfit to gain entry to Zarem, an exclusive off-world haven for the wealthy and socially elite. While foraging through the rubbish, gifted cyborg scientist Dr. Ido discovers the remains of a centuries-old cyborg. Back at his lab, he rebuilds her, and names her Alita. Unable to recall her past, Alita strives to understand the world around her, making friends with the ambitious Yugo and becoming entangled in his dream to buy entrance to Zarem. She decides to assist Yugo after a chance encounter with a hostile cyborg reveals her extraordinary powers, and registers herself as a hunter-warrior, in order to obtain some fast money. However, when one of Yugo&#8217;s get- rich-quick schemes backfires, The Factory place a bounty on his head, forcing him to take desperate measures to keep his dream alive. The drama that unravels as a result gives Alita a painful insight into the deepest desires that drive the human world.

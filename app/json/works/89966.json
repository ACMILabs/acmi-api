While foraging through the rubbish, gifted cyborg scientist Dr. Ido discovers the remains of a centuries-old cyborg. Back at his lab, he rebuilds her, and names her Alita. Unable to recall her past, Alita strives to understand the world around her, making friends with the ambitious Yugo and becoming entangled in his dream to buy entrance to Zarem.

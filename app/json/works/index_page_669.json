We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo. And the rest was history, I suppose.</p>\n<p>[FANS CHEERING]</p>\n<p>[OTHER SIDE BOOING]</p>\n<p>And then if you thought that was erupting over there, well, the display when I was over other side of game was something to behold.

Fizz used to cart me around everywhere and play footy. And then one thing led to another and I developed into seniors, and Fizz was a senior umpire in the North Central League. And so Fizz umpired quite a few games when I was a young fellow playing.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t actually get to see Fizz play. But if you listen to the storytellers around Wedderburn, they say Fizz didn&#8217;t mind dishing a little bit out, being a rover and being small, got that small man syndrome.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  Yeah, I was a very fiery player. I was very tough and very fiery. But when I give it up, I thought, I went back and I just changed the attitude all over. And I thought, well, I&#8217;ve got to be a lot different from what I was as a player.</p>\n<p>I started in 1974, 28 years of umpiring. I umpired 560 games, and I&#8217;ve done at least 20 Grand Finals.</p>\n<p>[MAN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done all those games without any reports. I&#8217;ve sent people off and I&#8217;ve warned people. I&#8217;d rather give them a 50-meter or talk to them than things like that. Because I thought that was a lot easier. Because well, I got more respect by doing that than reporting. That&#8217;s the way I looked at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT: Fizz was always on the side of the bloke that hit second, because he thought the bloke that hit second had a reason to hit. So the bloke that hit first was always in trouble with Fizz. Never be the instigator, but it was OK to be the retaliater.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Fizz was one of the very first of the idea of just get the play going, you know? If there was biffo or something happening, Fizz wasn&#8217;t going to run in and try and be authoritarian. He&#8217;d just throw the ball up, or bounce the ball, and just get on with it, you know? And if there was 10 blokes belting the heebie-jeebies out of each other down the road, well, eventually they&#8217;d stop, because the footy&#8217;d come into their area. And that was a&#8212; and it was a great philosophy, and a lot of blokes sort of&#8212; I suppose he&#8217;s a pioneer in that area, of getting the game going.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  You&#8217;ve got to be fit. You&#8217;ve got to try very hard to make yourself fit. And I was happy to be ready to play. And you main thing, I&#8217;ve found, is to get in position. Make sure you&#8217;ve got in position. And make the effort to get in position would make it a lot easier. And the players, if you&#8217;ve done that, you&#8217;ve got a lot more respect back. That&#8217;s the way I look at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I enjoyed every bit of what I done. Use to just look for Saturday. Used to train every night and just look for Saturdays to come.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:01:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

mascot with the Hamilton 1959 Grand Final team and describes the impact that football had on the town.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Daryl Pitman.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>DARYL PITMAN:  I do have vivid memories of the 1959 Grand Final. I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne.

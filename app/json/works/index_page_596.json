I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo.

Over four years that I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve just decided that I love it, and I love football, and that&#8217;s why I stayed.</p>\n<p>-When I first walked into the umpire fraternity, the track supervisor at the stage, he firstly said, come on, young fellow, here&#8217;s the ball. Took me over to the point pace, and he said, showed me the basics of hanging on and holding the ball. And he said, now, I want you to bounce this ball up and down at this point pace. It&#8217;s gotta be straight up and down it, and it&#8217;s also got to reach the top of it.</p>\n<p>So for two weeks or so I practiced and I practiced. After a couple of weeks, I, yeah, I mastered it. And so I went over to the track supervisor Roy. And I said, Roy, I&#8217;ve done it, where do I go next?</p>\n<p>He says, no son, come here. We&#8217;ve moved to the goal post now. And I said, what? And he said, now I want you to do it up and down the goal post and to the height of the goal post.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a skill, and we&#8217;ve lost it in the country because we throw the ball up. But for the young fellas, my mentees, it&#8217;s a case that will be taught, and I hope to pass that skill onto them.</p>\n<p>-Well, I&#8217;ll have to learn how to bounce it one day for I want to go to the AFL, which I do. It&#8217;d be a dream one day walking around the MCG with all the 100,000 people roaring. But yeah, I&#8217;ll just let it take me and enjoy the ride, I reckon.</p>\n<p>-It&#8217;s put another spring in my step doing this mentoring program, because these young fellas, I can see that possibility that I&#8217;d hope one will make it to AFL.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>-Basically, he works with me and pass on his knowledge of how to umpire and how to treat players, which is a fundamental aspect of being an umpire. I&#8217;m nervous every single game just because the fellas there, they&#8217;re another foot taller than me and just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a lot of expectations of me to perform.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>I just do it because I love it, and it&#8217;s a great game.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

Final. I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history.

And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened. But it has never dimmed my passion for Hamilton Footy Club, and I follow their fortunes with great interest.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label":

Mitchell-Dorrity and the Cohuna Historical Centre, and Tom Greenaway.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>Arthur was interested in footy all his life and decided to take up Goal Umpiring. Enjoyed, I think, getting yelled at and all that stuff.</p>\n<p>We acquired this little pup, a little brown curly retriever, which is a breed of dog mainly used for duck shooting and all that sort of stuff. An’ they’re renowned for carrying things in their mouth and that’s their biggest ambition to carry things around, and ah, she started to go to the football with Arthur and she decided she’d become a working member too, and um, she used to… because we lived quite close to the football ground she knew when there was football on and she was always very excited until he made a move and um, she would carry the flags over too the ground an’ when the captains and what-have-you went out to the centre to throw the coin up she would go, as soon as the coin had been thrown and the winning Captain pointed she would just automatically pick up the flags and race down to that end.</p>\n<p>She got tripped over a few times but she would generally just sit in front of the car and just wait and wait and wait and then at half time she would head off and they’d both go and have a drink some where and she’d repeat the project and just carry the flags back to the other end that’s about there was to it, but she was very keen on that little job. But she became, like, quite an icon, everyone knew her.

And I had number 9, so they turned around and said I had to go first. So they gave me number 1 and pushed me at the door to go through, yeah. Because once one went out, then the rest followed, of course.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>I was brought up with five brothers, so you learned to kick the football. It was a lot of fun. Put it that way. A lot of fun. It was&#8212; some of the girls had never been in a pair of shorts, and &#8230; As you can imagine what it was like when they got out on the&#8212; and some of them had never kicked a football, so you could imagine what that was like..</p>\n<p>[PEOPLE SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The first time we played, there must&#8217;ve been some footballers up in Daylesford at the time. And I remember them taking up a collection. And I got half the money and June Jeffries&#8212; I think it was June Jeffries&#8212; got the other half, because they reckoned we were the best on the ground.</p>\n<p>And it was surprising was in the people would go to see&#8212; well, I think most of the men just went to see the girls in their shorts, I think, and see how they&#8217;d kick a football.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[PEOPLE SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>They were all good friends. Oh, a jovial lot. When you look at that now, I can count up the ones that&#8217;s not there, that&#8217;s not with us anymore. It&#8217;s sad, really, that there&#8217;s so many of &#8216;ems gone. But then when you look at it now and see the girls that&#8217;s out kicking football on the ground, there&#8217;s just as many as there is boys.</p>\n<p>And some of the girls can kick. Over at Newland last week, there was a little tot, and she was left-footed. And she could kick that ball. Oh, I watched her and watched her. Yes, I thought she was very good.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:56:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values":

And those sort of things went out in the early &#8216;50s.</p>\n<p>ONLOOKER:  Let fly, Richie!</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER: Well, every coach I had tried to teach me how to kick dropkicks, and I never really mastered dropkicks. I remember playing one day and Jim Gulley was coaching, and I was playing center halfback. And Gulley didn&#8217;t mind me kicking them, because everyone else thought I&#8217;d kick them further than I did. And Gulley would lead up the ground and the center halfback wouldn&#8217;t follow him, because he thought he was getting too close to me. But that&#8217;s as far as I could kick the jolly things.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Nowadays with the drop punt, everyone kicks a drop punt and the balls so easy to handle. It doesn&#8217;t matter which leg you&#8217;re kicking. You&#8217;ve still got the ball in the same position to kick it. And it&#8217;s made a lot of difference to football, the drop punt, has.

And I start early, about quarter past 7:00, every Saturday, and the others come in about 8:00.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>JAN ENDERS:  I&#8217;ve had three sons play over the years. And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back. I said, well, just get me some boots and I&#8217;ll be right.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:04:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

Mr. Qin has two sons and a daughter who are all grown-ups now. The elder son is about to get married, which cost Mr. Qin a fortune. Mr. Qin listens to the matchmaker’s advice and wants his daughter to marry a young man from a well-off family. However, Qin’s daughter, Li Mei, is already in love with another man, Li Shangyou, whose family is quite poor. Li Mei asks her father to give Shangyou a chance, who promises to Qin that he will prepare enough money in three months to marry his daughter. Li Mei, Shangyou and Shangyou’s mother all work hard day and night to make money for the marriage. Just by the time they had the money ready, Shangyou’s mother fell sick but refused to use the money for her illness. Li Mei is moved and determined to marry Shangyou. However, Li Mei’s father severely blames his daughter and forces her to marry the other man. Li Mei seeks support from the director of the Women’s Association, who firmly stands on Li Mei’s side. At Qin’s elder son’s wedding banquet, Li Mei disappears. Shangyou’s mother finds a scarf of Li Mei and sends it to Qin, who is shocked and thought his daughter must have died. Qin regrets for what he did. However, it turned out that Li Mei didn’t die but went to marry Shangyou with the support of the Women’s Association.</p>\n<p>Xiaoxiang Film Studio was established in 1958 when Chinese cinema was nationalized with the help of Soviet Union’s experts. Formerly known as Hunan Film Studio, it changed to the current name in 1980. The film was made in the early 1980s when the economic reform was launched and a “Thought Liberation” movement swept the whole country. This film can be understood as a politically-oriented film in the sense that it delivers a clear message to its audience that arranged marriage and mercenary marriage represent the feudal ideas and should be condemned.

Zhang meets her and expresses his love for her, but she rebuffs him. Zhang explains that he knows about the children and wants to be their father. She asks why and he explains that he was also orphaned as a child and only survived thanks to the love of a woman like Ouyang, who took him as her own and nurtured him.</p>\n<p>The film ends with them all starting a happy family together.<br />\n(2 stars: James Donald; June 10, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ People's Liberation Army (China)", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865366, "name": "Li Zhonglin", "creator_id": 82286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865362, "name": "Chang Yan", "creator_id": 82283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865361, "name": "Changchun Film Studio", "creator_id": 34767, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865370, "name": "Yang Yaqin", "creator_id": 82290, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865369, "name": "Guojun Chen", "creator_id": 82289, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865368, "name": "Wang Zhihua", "creator_id": 82288, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865367, "name": "Xiaoqing Liu", "creator_id": 82287, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865365, "name": "Gao Hongbao", "creator_id": 82285, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865364, "name": "Li Lingxiu", "creator_id": 82284, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865363, "name": "Chang Yan", "creator_id": 82283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146396", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [55244], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115748, "acmi_id": "Z000005", "title": "The Spring festival = Guo nian", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-spring-festival-guo-nian", "creator_credit": "Bai Zhipu, Huang Jianzhong, Hong Kong Vanho Film Company Ltd and Beijing Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1991", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film is set in the waning years of the nuclear family.

He meets Sarah Williams, a Catholic activist of left persuasion with a strong anti-American bent, and a great love is immediately born. However, despite their profound and intense connection - both physical and spiritual - Fielding and Sarah represent different perspectives on matters of politics, social change, and America as a nation.

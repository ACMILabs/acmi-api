He expresses, however, a keen interest in learning to play. &#8220;I&#8217;m determined to learn the trumpet&#8221;, he says, &#8220;even if it makes me ill&#8221;.<br />\nXin Tianxi is announced as head of the band, and they are shown practicing eagerly all over the village. After some hesitation at his ability to conduct, Xin Tianxi leads the band to perform an arrangement successfully. &#8220;We&#8217;re not rotten seeds&#8221;, he claims, &#8220;we&#8217;ve sprouted!&#8221; He believes, however, that they still require a lot of practice.<br />\nLixin practices in secret due to Lao Qu&#8217;s disapproval. When he is eventually caught, he is accused of letting his farm work suffer in favour of his obsession with the village band. A fight ensues and Lao Qu threatens to break the trumpet.<br />\nThey attend a performance of Gypsy, but are disappointed to discover that the band is hiding in the wings, while only the dancers are visible on stage. As they try to watch the band in the orchestra pit, Professor Jin enters, and lets them watch the band up close from within the pit. Inspired by Gypsy, the band practices fanatically, and gives its first performance in front of the town. Professor Jin offers advice and constructive criticism.<br />\nThe band plays at a local sports meet, and the whole town, including the authorities, is very impressed. The press goes wild, and Miss Li is overwhelmed by the attention. A local asks Xin Tianxi if the band can play at his son&#8217;s wedding.<br />\nXin Tianxi meets with Professor Jin, revealing that his involvement with the band has complicated his home life. He expresses a great affection for Miss Li, but is worried that the band, which she objects to, is further complicating their relationship. Although they grew up together, she is educated and he is a meager peasant. He wishes to marry her, but is afraid he cannot.<br />\nThe band&#8217;s performance is broadcast on television, and the families of the members, even the bitter Lao Qu, gather around watch them play. Sujing tells Lixin she would like to join the band, but he dismisses her, leading her to believe he is having an affair. She leaves, leaving Lixin with their daughter Liangliang.<br />\nLixin is late to band rehearsal and Xin Tianxi chastises him for it. Lixin admits that Sujing has left him with the baby. Sujing confides in Miss Li, worried about Lixin&#8217;s wellbeing, but Miss Li brushes her off, telling her Lixin will be fine with Liangliang. Miss Li tells the band to stop playing, afraid of the growing familial repercussions for its members. The rift in communication is resolved, and the band members are all happy.<br />\nThe band performs well to a responsive audience at a local awards ceremony, and they demand an encore. Xin Tianxi, knowing that they are now in high demand, tells the village to &#8220;line up&#8221;. The peasant band has changed the village forever.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nThe film has strong Communist overtones. Characters refer to each other as &#8220;comrade&#8221;, wear plain, practical clothing and work in factories. They are told not to &#8220;boast&#8221;, and maintain that they could not afford the instruments if it were not for &#8220;the Party&#8221;. There is a struggle between culture and agriculture, and a reference to Maxim Gorky, founder of Socialist Realism, a Soviet style of art, its purpose the furtherance of the goals of socialism and communism. &#8216;Fascinating Musical Band&#8217; is great example of this style of filmmaking.<br />\n(3 stars - Aleena Glentis; August 9, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:49:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Big band music", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865585, "name": "Jia Wenjing", "creator_id": 82495, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865581, "name": "Wang Haowei", "creator_id": 34751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865580, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865589, "name": "Liang Guanghua", "creator_id": 82499, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865588, "name": "Zhao Ziyue", "creator_id": 82498, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865587, "name": "Mi Tiezen", "creator_id": 82497, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865586, "name": "He Wei", "creator_id": 82496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865584, "name": "Li Zhensheng", "creator_id": 82494, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865583, "name": "Yang Shuhu", "creator_id": 82493, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865582, "name": "Fang Chunru", "creator_id": 82492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146423", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [55271], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115776, "acmi_id": "Z000034", "title": "The Poetess Li Qing-Zhao = Li Qing Zhao", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-poetess-li-qing-zhao-li-qing-zhao", "creator_credit": "Chen Dali, Zhang Jinglong and Xi'an Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The film presents a romanticized biography of one of China&#8217;s most famous poets, Li Qingzhao (AD. 1084-1155).

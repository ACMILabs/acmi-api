As the story opens, the sleepy city of Suzhou is awakened by sound of an ancient bell.  A tour guide named Chen Airan, working for the International Tourism Agency, is preparing another busy day ahead while she introduces her hometown on a crowded tour bus.  Later, she waits for Mr Song, Chairman of the board from South Asia Bank to arrive at the train station from abroad.  Oddly, Mr Song rejects all touring activities she organized for him, and only wishes to spend time alone in his hotel room—even the television was ordered to be taken away so he can have some quiet time.<br />\nEncountering such an eccentric, seemingly misogynistic and miserable old man, Airan was confused and frustrated. She had never felt unwanted and was determined to discover different ways to approach and gain Mr Song&#8217;s trust.  While Mr Song isolates himself from the world, Airan takes on a Japanese tour group. Within the group, two Japanese tourists particularly caught her eye.  One had lost his two sons during the Second World War in China and had made unsuccessful attempts to end his life.  The other was an ex-Japanese soldier who was in Suzhou during the Japanese invasion of China in World War 2.  During this tour in China, he hopes to find a woman named Su Xiaoyu whom he had met during the time he served as a guard at the Pan Gate in Suzhou.  On this tour, his ultimate goal was to return two gold rings which belonged to Su and atone for his sinful deeds during the war.  Airan&#8217;s knowledge of their past created major internal conflict because her grandfather was a victim of the Nanjing Massacre; however, in the end she chose not to let her emotions affect her professionalism as a tour guide and hosted their stay in China to the best of her ability.<br />\nSubsequently, after such encounters, Airan learnt that to gain Mr Song&#8217;s trust, she had to first know his past.  Consequently, by oepning a part of his past, she realized that Mr Song originated from Shandong Province but had move overseas in the early part of his life because of the miserable economic situation.  In the following years living abroad, he had tenaciously devoted all his energy and effort into expanding his own economic assets - living a life without meaning.  This visit to China was a chance for him to reconnect with his roots - returning to his mother land.  Coincidentally one day, he meets a young man who shares his surname and unexpectedly found that the youngster, Song Pan, is the son of his work colleague from abroad.   When Airan saw that Mr Song was ecstatic at the sight of Song Pan, she subsequently organises Mr. Song to reunite with his long-lost relatives who are still living in China.  In the end, Mr Song donated the woodcut of &#8216;Patriarchal Clan Geneology of the Song&#8217;(handed down from the Qing Dynasty) to the Government of Suzhou, and went happily on his way.  Airan once again uses her sincerity to enable Mr Song, another one of her clients, to feel the warmth of the country, and rekindle the flicker of hope in his life.<br />\nAlthough Airan is good at encouraging and supporting for others, she is less organized and optimistic with her own life.  Outwardly, she claims that she is a modern, career-oriented and independent woman who is proud to be a single, but secretly she has fallen in love with her Chinese poetry tutor, Mr. Li.  Her western friend Louise claims that women have the right to not marry and not have children.  Airan is subconsciously influenced by Louise, but to her surprise her friend also falls in love with Mr. Li.  Between the three of them, their triangular relationship becomes complex.  Ultimately Airan runs away without confronting the issue.  The film ends with her starting a new day by guiding a tour, putting her worries and woes behind her.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of Film:<br />\nThis is an interesting film lightly questioning the role of women in China in the 1980s.  Throughout the movie, there are a good few minutes in the film dedicated to watching an unidentified mother lovingly breastfeeding and caressing her new born baby, and subsequently we are brought to the attention of Airan supporting Louise&#8217;s idea of remaining single.  On one hand, viewers are exposed to the good mother discourse, while on the other, we are also witnessing women&#8217;s role shifting to become more modern and subjective (which is thought to be a phenomenon after the Mao era[in the post-socialist period]).</p>\n<p>Director&#8217;s background:<br />\nMa Bingyu was born in 1942 in Beijing. He graduated from The Beijing Film Academy in 1966 and started his film career in the Beijing Film Studio.  From research, &#8216;Your Smile&#8217; seems to be the last of his work as a film director.  Ma is considered as the Fourth Generation of filmmakers in Chinese Cinema.  Those making films as the Fourth Generation in this post-socialist period mostly produce films that focused on human emotions, exploring the experience of ordinary/working class life - as it is evident in this film.</p>\n<p>My thoughts/interpretations:<br />\nLouise (acted by Jean Johnson) in the film was an interesting character whom I believe was a reflection of Western ideals gone hay-wired.  Of note, out of the many films I&#8217;ve watched, it is quite rare to see a western actor speaking Chinese.  However, Louise is oftentimes portrayed like a bimbo-head because of the ridiculous things she says e.g. She wants to have a black-haired baby as a souvenir/memento to take back from China (although she does not want to get married).  Her role in the story seems like an attempt to highlight the stark difference between western and eastern cultural ideals perceived by Chinese people in the 1980s.  When Louise failed to make Mr. Li comply with her wish to have a &#8220;black-haired memento&#8221;, she tells Airan that Mr. Li rejected her by saying: &#8220;I&#8217;m a Chinese. Chinese people have their own morality standards. They stress responsibility and commitment.&#8221; Such a statement in the film seems to want to hint to audience that Western and Eastern people value different virtues and morality standards.<br />\nIn my point of view, Mr Song&#8217;s case in the film also seems to highlight a famous Chinese proverb as a significant subtextual message:  Falling leaves return to their roots [pinyin: Luo4 Ye4 Gui1 Gen1].  This proverb is often used for those who have migrated oversea; meaning everything belongs somewhere, and everyone is drawn back to the place where their life started—going back to their &#8220;roots&#8221;.

If Chinese immigrants in Australia watch this movie, perhaps it serves to remind them that their roots are in China.<br />\n(3 stars - Pearl Lau; November 13, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tourism", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tourist trade - Social aspects", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Tourist trade - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865660, "name": "Zhou Ying", "creator_id": 82562, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865657, "name": "Zou Dazhi", "creator_id": 82560, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865656, "name": "Ma Bingyu", "creator_id": 82559, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865655, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865664, "name": "Jane Johnson", "creator_id": 82565, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865663, "name": "Li Xiuming", "creator_id": 82564, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865662, "name": "Wei Guochun", "creator_id": 82449, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865661, "name": "Jia Yulan", "creator_id": 82563, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865659, "name": "Chang Yi", "creator_id": 82561, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865658, "name": "Zhang Tianmin", "creator_id": 82276, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146433", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [55281], "external_references": []}, {"id": 115786, "acmi_id": "Z000045", "title": "True and fake Monkey Kings = Zhen Jia Mei Hou Wang", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "true-and-fake-monkey-kings-zhen-jia-mei-hou-wang", "creator_credit": "Shi Jie, Li Bangjin, Fang Ying and Pearl River Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1983", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The group are set upon by the Six-Eared Monkey, who uses his magic to possess three forest animals, transforming them into the exact duplicates of each of our heroes.

Liang Lili is a Year 4 student and has an excellent singing voice. She is selected for a competition by the Art Troupe of the Children’s Palace. Lili is excited to share the good news with her parents. But what awaits at home is her parents’ quarrelling. Lili’s dad moved out, Lili’s mum couldn’t cheer up, and Lili’s study was affected. One day, Lili saw her father with another woman and realized that the worst would happen. Her parents divorced and the smile in Lili’s face was gone. Lili’s mum relocated to another city and Lili’s dad moved back with the lady and her son. Lili hates the new “mum” and the “little brother”, who broke her piggy bank. The “hatred” between Lili and her new brother escalated, which worried their parents. One night, Lili and her brother were both lonely, each missing their own separated parent. The two kids started to feel sympathetic with each other as both suffered the same. In order to help her brother to go back to see his father, Lili saved money to buy a ticket for him. The two kids said good bye at the train station, and Lili decided to go and look for her mum.</p>\n<p>Directed by a female director, the film shows that family melodrama is a recurring theme in Chinese cinema.

Over the course of six weeks, 300 000 people were brutally massacred. The contents of the film range from heart-rending to absurd, as the director tries to approach this highly sensitive event in modern Chinese history.</p>\n<p>Crowds of civilians flee across a bridge, crowding onto boats in an effort to escape the onslaught of the Japanese military. Amongst them are the government officials, abandoning their posts out of sheer terror. A foreign blonde woman drives through the carnage in black car. Arriving at a makeshift hospital, she witnesses the hardship and sufferng the Chinese people are undergoing at the hands of the bombarding. She finds a doctor named Zhan and tells him that there is time for them to secure passage on the last of the departing American ships.</p>\n<p>The invading force rounds up those left behind in the city and takes photos as they gun them down. However, it is immediately visible that there have been issues in casting actual Japanese, as these supposed &#8220;foreign invaders&#8221; all speak fluent Chinese. This accentuates a point of ambivalence which escalates in tandem with the scale of violence they perform.</p>\n<p>At first, the Japanese commander is disturbed that the Yangtze is running red with blood: This does not conform with the image they purport of being the liberators of China. They allow 200 000 refugees to flee into the 3-square-kilometer rat nest of the &#8220;Safety Area&#8221;. Fan, a frightened Chinese photographer and householder, is threatened to develop the Japanese photos of the carnage, or they will burn down his house, kill his children and rape his pregnant wife.</p>\n<p>Strict censorship is enforced so as to prevent news of the carnage from being leaked to the public.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Japanese women in traditional kimono smile and scatter sweets along the ground for the frightenned locals who stand in fear. This scene is actually quite well done, and sets a precedent for the extremes of absurdity we will encounter later in the film. Meanwhile, men are led into the mountains and summarily executed by beyonetting and machine-gunning.</p>\n<p>It is not long after before the Japanese invade the church and murder the people inside. The soldiers want to defend themselves, but doctor Zhan implores them to not act, otherwise the Japanese will slaughter the refugees. They throw all their weapons in the lake, except one man who conceals his pistol in a bookshelf. Under the pretext of searching for Chinese soldiers, the Japanese invade the Safety Area and round up all the refugees.</p>\n<p>The film&#8217;s most powerful scene takes place in the Safety Area&#8217;s library, when a stereotypical Japanese man kicks a newly born child on the ground and beyonets it, lifting it up above him and laughing despicably as he lets the newborn&#8217;s blood trickle down all over his face. Then they gang rape the mother and her 12 year old daughter before murdering them both. The total collapse of civilization is symbolised by the bookshelf, full of works on ethics, history and human achievements, collapsing on the ground.</p>\n<p>The only thing left for them to do is to record the atrocities. Fan, whose family was murdered, has the photos and risks his life to retrieve them from his house. He gives his life to save Zhan and the photos. One Chinese man tries to surrender the photos to get the photos back, but is tricked into giving the wrong photos.</p>\n<p>The variety of atrocities depicted include decapitation,  mass graves where people are buried alive, murdering of wounded, and putting an old man in a bag and setting it on fire.</p>\n<p>The film ends with a scene of Zhan trapped in the belltower of a burning church. With no way to get out or survive he rings the bells to symbolise his never-ending struggle to tell the world of what has happened.<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Massacre in Nanjing = Tu Cheng Xue Ji</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Lou Ling, Luo Guanqun and Nanjing Film Production Company</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1987</p>", "description": "<p>This film is reputed to be the first to ever dramatic retelling of the events leading from the Japanese invasion of Nanjing, on Dec. 13, 1937.

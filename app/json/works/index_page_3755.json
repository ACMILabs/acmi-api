Megalomaniac &#8220;Buffalo Bill&#8221; Cody assumes the legend created for him by writer Ned Buntline, aided and abetted by his producer and his publicist, perpetuating myths of white triumph over savage &#8220;Injuns&#8221; in his Wild West show, as audiences cheer him on and buy his merchandise. But when Sitting Bull joins the troupe with his interpreter, his request for authenticity threatens to throw a wrench into the proceedings. Regardless of how Bill may feel about the facts, he must bow to the preferences of the paying public. Cast includes: Paul Newman, Joel Grey, Kevin McCarthy, Harvey Keitel, Allan Nicholls, Geraldine Chaplin, Burt Lancaster, Frank Kaquitts.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Germany - Berlin - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indians of North America", "Biographical", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 875538, "name": "De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 23143, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875539, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 875537, "name": "Full House", "creator_id": 77610, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46656", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1976", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1976"}], "labels": [29026]}, {"id": 92217, "acmi_id": "315444", "title": "Buffalo 66", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "buffalo-66", "creator_credit": "Cinepix Film Properties, Chris Hanley and Vincent Gallo", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Vincent Gallo made his directorial debut with this comedy drama about convict, Billy Brown, who is released from prison after serving a five year sentence for a crime he did not commit.

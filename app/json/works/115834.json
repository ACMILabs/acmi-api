Mao presumes that this means the Nationalist Party will soon attack yet strongly claims that he will persevere through all of the pressure of war.<br />\nThe following scene shows Yan’an, the city that Mao is residing in, being hit by a surprise attack led by Chiang Kai-Shek and his army. First the city is bombed by an air raid and then it is overrun by thousands of foot soldiers. All of the villagers retreat, abandoning their burning houses after the bombings.

The name of the secret group is the Kunlun Column. Their plan is to divide their forces into four separate groups, sending Mao with one of them in an attempt to relocate him to a safer location. Mao joins his troops and embarks on a vast journey through the mountains and across extremely rough terrain. He is depicted as an equal to his soldiers and is shown walking and socialising with all ranks of his army.<br />\nChiang Kai-Shek decides to buy extremely technologically advanced war instruments from the US government officials and uses them to locate exactly where Mao is and determine where he is going.

Bob Brown, Bono (U2), Australian Conservation Foundation, Friends of the Earth, and most importantly from the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation who provided the legal advice and direction for the Mirrar people in their fight for their rights. Also includes newsreel and archival footage, and backing by some great original music with strong political tones.

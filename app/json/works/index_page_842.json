Clara for her part takes an immediate dislike to Jean-Jacques - considering him a materialistic, middle-class, tasteless bore.

Thus whilst interrogating notions of class and taste, this comedy of manners is also a humanistic and wry portrayal of modern relationships, mores and ways.

Potter&#8217;s film is divided into twelve lessons during which the two protagonists learn about each other, fight over who is leading who, start a love story, and eventually end up in Buenos Aires to learn from the tango masters. The film is shot mostly in black and white, except for some dream sequences in which Sally fantasizes about an ill-fated film project. Veron performs many modern dance numbers, including tap and ballroom dancing, as part of his tango repertoire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture authorship", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tango (Dance)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961760, "name": "OKCK Films", "creator_id": 32061, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961761, "name": "PIE", "creator_id": 32062, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961762, "name": "Neue Deutsche Filmgesellschaft", "creator_id": 28109, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961763, "name": "Christopher Sheppard", "creator_id": 61871, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961764, "name": "Sally Potter", "creator_id": 61866, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961759, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50674", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32647]}]}

This masterful film by John Huston, directed late in his career, is one of his finest works. Brad Dourif plays an alienated young ex-serviceman who wishes to create a new form of Church which preaches religion without salvation. On his perverse Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress through the underbelly of the Southern United States, he is taken up as a religious saviour by a range of unscrupulous con-men who are only to willing to exploit him for financial gain. Absurd and blackly comic, &#8220;Wise Blood&#8221; paints a disturbing picture of the twisted relationship between religion and politics in the United States. Released on the eve of Reagan&#8217;s election to President, this film questions the combination of religious hysteria, unashamed materialism and deliberate ignorance of fundamentalism.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Folk literature, American", "Literature&nbsp;→ O'Connor, Flannery, 1925-1964", "People&nbsp;→ O'Connor, Flannery, 1925-1964"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951344, "name": "John Huston", "creator_id": 71876, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951343, "name": "Kathy Fitzgerald", "creator_id": 77339, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951342, "name": "Michael Fitzgerald", "creator_id": 77338, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951341, "name": "Ithaca Prod", "creator_id": 25288, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951340, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 17651, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9wTs3H1P3ASSsoKXFALMwpOVjnH.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Wise blood (John Huston) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1120, "height": 1600, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39058", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [22634]}, {"id": 74814, "acmi_id": "30550", "title": "Wisconsin: the good life", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wisconsin-the-good-life", "creator_credit": "Dick Durrance and Dick Durrance Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1967", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1967-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A survey of Wisconsin - touches briefly the story of the States and the present agricultural and industrial riches.

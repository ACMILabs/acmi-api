Grounded in McLuhan&#8217;s last scholarly work, &#8216;The Laws of Media&#8217;, the film translates the four laws he proposed into an illuminating and revealing text, haunted by archival footage and the voice of McLuhan himself. Blending all forms of media, including animation and special effects, &#8216;McLuhan&#8217;s Wake&#8217; is a visually dazzling and poetic film, with narration by renowned performance artist Laurie Anderson, and commentary by scholars Eric McLuhan, Neil Postman, Lewis Lapham and journalist Patrick Watson.

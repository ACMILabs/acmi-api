Judgment at Nuremberg has galvanised audiences around the world with its poignant historical commentary, riveting entertainment and compelling performances.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nuremberg War Crime Trials, Nuremberg, Germany, 1946-1949", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Courtroom films and programs", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1986914, "name": "Stanley Kramer", "creator_id": 67909, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q73136", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986913, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q219400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1986921, "name": "Burt Lancaster", "creator_id": 77332, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q160528", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986918, "name": "Judy Garland", "creator_id": 76830, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q11637", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986917, "name": "Marlene Dietrich", "creator_id": 77330, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4612", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986919, "name": "Maximilian Schell", "creator_id": 76734, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q153018", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986920, "name": "Montgomery Clift", "creator_id": 77331, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q193102", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986916, "name": "Richard Widmark", "creator_id": 77329, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q320036", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986915, "name": "Spencer Tracy", "creator_id": 74505, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q71275", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1986912, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39017", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [22597]}, {"id": 83102, "acmi_id": "304294", "title": "The Apartment", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-apartment", "creator_credit": "Billy Wilder and Mirisch Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1960", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 53439, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q270510"}], "brief_description": "<p>This classic romantic comedy gave Jack Lemmon one of his best roles.

Otto (Emilio Estevez) is a bored young man, just fired from his job in a supermarket, who meets up with a smooth-talking loner (Harry Dean Stanton) who recruits him as a &#8220;repo man&#8221;: a repossesor of cars because of default of payment. The strange plot involves aliens, Government spies and assorted punks and gangsters all searching for a 1964 Chevy Malibu which may hold the secret of life and death. The plot, however, doesn&#8217;t really matter. What does is the assured surreal landscape that Alex Cox discovers in the underbelly of suburban Los Angeles, and his irreverent experiments with genre. The LA of Repo Man is a disintegrating city, violent and alienated, but the film manages to undiscover a weird and sometimes eloquent beauty in the decay.

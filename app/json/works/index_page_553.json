With the use of many letters, diaries and film we re-experience a war that involved the people of 5 continents. Narrated by Dame Judi Dench, we also hear voice-overs by Ian Richardson, Martin Landau, Wendy Craig, Tim Pigott-Smith, Chris Fairbank, Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, Tom Fleming, John Shrapnel, Malcolm McDowell and Imogen Stubbs reading passages from personal diaries and letters. Many historians including Dr Jay Winter provide valuable background information relating to battles and events which occurred both before, during and after, what became known as The Great War. Tape Two-Legacy contains the last four episodes of this remarkable series.

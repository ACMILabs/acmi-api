As always, Polanski proves an effective and imaginative master of the horror genre. Note: &#8220;The Tenant&#8221; is a USA/French co-production in which the French actors are dubbed into English.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental illness", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology, Pathological", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ French literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Places&nbsp;→ Paris (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-tenant", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997676, "name": "Roman Polanski", "creator_id": 10072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997675, "name": "Andrew Braunsberg", "creator_id": 23968, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997674, "name": "Marianne Productions", "creator_id": 31794, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50967", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1976", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1976"}], "labels": [32914]}, {"id": 79276, "acmi_id": "300211", "title": "The Tale of Ruby Rose", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-tale-of-ruby-rose", "creator_credit": "Roger Scholes and Bryce Menzies", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 24133, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7767971"}], "brief_description": "<p>Set amid the austere beauty of Tasmania&#8217;s mountainous landscape, The Tale of Ruby Rose is a portrait of a family alone in the wilderness and one woman&#8217;s strength to overcome an intense fear of the dark.

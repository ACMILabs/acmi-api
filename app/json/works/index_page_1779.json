In the meantime he is placed under the custody of the Captain of the island&#8217;s fortress and military contingent (Daniel Auteuil). Rather than lock him away, the Captain places him in the custodianship of his wife, Madame La (Juliette Binoche) who teaches him how to write and, as their relationship deepens, gradually draws out his best qualities. His transformation from a inarticulate brute into a sensitive, caring man, threatens the authorities who, despite the prisoner&#8217;s increasing popularity with the island&#8217;s locals, are determined to see &#8220;justice&#8221; done. Based on an actual incident, &#8220;The Widow of Saint-Pierre&#8221; reveals how the will of the people can be thwarted by the few in power. As the film progresses, its emotional and political outcomes unfold in increasingly unpredictable directions. The inventive script, alternately serious and comic, combined with the sweeping cinematography and musical score make for a complex, rewarding film.

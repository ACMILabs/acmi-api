Her final scene is unforgettable.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/sunset-blvd", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2317542, "name": "Billy Wilder", "creator_id": 56081, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51547", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2317540, "name": "Charles Brackett", "creator_id": 23438, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q385055", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2317537, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q159846", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2317554, "name": "Buster Keaton", "creator_id": 831, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q103949", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2317553, "name": "Cecil B.

The electric rock score includes original music by Mick Jagger, The Last Poets and Ry Cooder.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Great Britain", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/performance", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2198811, "name": "Nicolas Roeg", "creator_id": 69531, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51541", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2198810, "name": "Donald Cammell", "creator_id": 77649, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q975488", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2198808, "name": "Sanford Lieberson", "creator_id": 26490, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16104490", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2198806, "name": "Goodtime Enterprises", "creator_id": 26489, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2198805, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2198804, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40511", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [24048]}, {"id": 84554, "acmi_id": "305875", "title": "The Greatest story ever told", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-greatest-story-ever-told", "creator_credit": "George Stevens and United Artists Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>With one of the finest film casts ever assembled, this epic has been hailed as the definitive screen version of the life and times of Jesus Christ.

It produces multi-colored &#8216;mineral maps&#8217; from either sections of drill core or from crushed particles. These maps can be interpreted to tell how much of a mineral is present, the grain sizes, and how minerals in the sample are associated with each other. Although developed for the mining industry, QEM*SEM can be used to characterise any kind of metalic or inorganic particles, yielding precise, detailed information in a readily accessible form.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:38:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Mineral industries", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Mineralogy", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Rock-forming minerals", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Automation", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemistry - Research", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Electron microscope", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mineralogical chemistry", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mineralogy", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Rock-forming minerals", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientific apparatus and instruments", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Technological innovations", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Technological innovations - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1809811, "name": "Nicholas Alexander", "creator_id": 14368, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 874160, "name": "CSIRO", "creator_id": 12109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 874162, "name": "Roger Seccombe", "creator_id": 14563, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45543", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [28091], "external_references": []}]}

This is the sequel to that film &#8220;Balinese surfer&#8221; as Bill and his production team revisit the original group, now all aged in their 40s, 25 years later. We follow their individual stories, the direction life has taken them, and how most of them still take time out to surf. Through personal narratives, intercut with footage from the original film, these Balinese men all express their concern for the environment, particularly with the enormous increase in tourism during the 80s and 90s.

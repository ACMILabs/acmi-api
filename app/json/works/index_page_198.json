As best mates, the trio spend most of their spare time hustling at Dave&#8217;s Bar for a bit of a laugh and some money on the side until one night they are asked to enter into a high stakes tournament run by the local crime boss &#8220;Daddy&#8221; (Enrico Mammarella). Their pool-playing lives suddenly changes - as the stakes get higher so trouble seems to follow and all three are faced with the prospect of doing what Daddy asks or else! But more than anything else, the &#8220;Stickmen&#8221; want to win. Humor, sex, violence, romance and pool blend together to make this a quirky and upbeat film in the tradition of &#8220;Lock stock and two smoking barrels&#8221; and also is director Hamish Rothwell&#8217;s first feature film.

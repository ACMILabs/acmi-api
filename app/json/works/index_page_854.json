He wants to leave, and when she tries to stop him (because of his sickness) a suspicious article falls from his knapsack. It turns out he is selling valuable medical materials to India and Nepal.</p>\n<p>The truck breaks down and the young man and woman make for the nearest township on foot, braving the risk of death by freezing, and all the beasts of the Tibetan wilderness, such as bears, snowleopards and wolves. They encounter a pack of wolves and must fend them off with fire. Meanwhile, the platoon leader is stuck looking after the cheeky little Tibetan hunter, who sneaks out his stuff and makes a break for it. However he is saved from a close call with wolves by the gun-toting platoon leader.</p>\n<p>The following scene could sum up the entire film: A grumpy tired Chinese soldier carrying an unpleasant old Tibetan musk-smuggler through a terrible and enchantingly untamed wilderness.</p>\n<p>The platoon leader ends up getting along quite well with hunter, who is a wild man, but good at heart. He explains that he just doesn&#8217;t want to be poor forever. The People&#8217;s Liberation Army officer understands this ambition to be self-determining, and this is a central theme of the film.</p>\n<p>At its core, this is a film about the natural will of all people to be invested with freedom and responsibility for their own lives.</p>\n<p>The young couple are forced to turn back, the unarmed boy in disgrace. Meanwhile, the Tibetan woman&#8217;s true grit seems to have restored platoon leader&#8217;s faith in women as capable of feats of great valour, and keen wits to boot. He watches her as she rides off on horseback to find the necessary parts.</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, the truck keeps breaking down, and a massive flood rises up and demolishes the roads. The platoon leader risks his life directing the truck through the flooded waters, with the Tibetan woman getting out to help him and almost being swept away. She is only saved through the combined efforts of the three travel companions.</p>\n<p>Eventually they all make it out OK, and bid each other farewell as the car drives off into the distance.</p>\n<p>Some highlights are:</p>\n<p>Discussions of the Tibetan notion of anthropomorphic reincarnation.</p>\n<p>Beautifal shots of towns, tents, festivals and colourful costumes, with local song and and dance.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>The interesting moral statement about the Tibetan attitude to &#8220;sharing&#8221; which the Chinese see as fundamentally a pretext for selfishness.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "Chinese", "English", "Tibetan"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Adventure films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tibet - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ People's Liberation Army (China)", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Public health - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - Cultural Revolution, 1966-1969", "Places&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233689, "name": "Tang Yulong", "creator_id": 82463, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233682, "name": "Li Xiepu", "creator_id": 82460, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233679, "name": "Shanghai Film Studio", "creator_id": 32710, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233703, "name": "Shanghai Film Orchestra", "creator_id": 82388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233701, "name": "Li Zheng", "creator_id": 82467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233698, "name": "Li Wei", "creator_id": 82466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233695, "name": "Ai Liya", "creator_id": 82465, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233692, "name": "Liu Xinyi", "creator_id": 82464, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233687, "name": "Qu Jiazhen", "creator_id": 82462, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2233684, "name": "Ren Ke", "creator_id": 82461, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146418", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [55266], "external_references": []}, {"id": 116734, "acmi_id": "B2001547", "title": "Qantas: I Still Call Australia Home [advertisement]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "qantas-i-still-call-australia-home-advertisement", "creator_credit": "Mojo MDA", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Over twenty years, Qantas has produced a series of commercials featuring the Peter Allen song &#8216;I Still Call Australia Home&#8217;.

He lives for the weekends when he gets together with his mod friends, dresses up in sharp suits, pops amphetamine pills and dances to soul and power-pop in London clubs. The group of Mods decide to head down to Brighton for the weekend and while there, getting drunk and getting high on speed, they clash with a rival gang of working-class youth, the Rockers, whose musical tastes run to the legends of the fifties - Elvis, Bill Haley, Chuck Berry et. al. - and whose dress is blue-collar jeans and t-shirts. Set in 1965 and loosely based on The Who&#8217;s conceptual album of the same name, &#8220;Quadrophenia&#8221; is a kinetic film about youth culture, alienation and working class life. Featuring an explosive musical score by The Who, as well as great soul and rock music from the fifties and sixties, &#8220;Quadrophenia&#8221; is by turns both a perceptive and critical examination of leisure and work. Jimmy&#8217;s job confines him to a drudgery like that of his parents. It is a life that he wants to escape. He is free only through the exhilaration of music and drugs. With Sting, Toyah Willcox and Ray Winstone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Fashion", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Fashion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amphetamine drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fashion", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Drug use", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Youth - Recreation", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ The Who (Musical group)", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ The Who (Musical group)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233619, "name": "Franc Roddam", "creator_id": 34507, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q348059", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233615, "name": "Bill Curbishley", "creator_id": 79991, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2490682", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233612, "name": "Roy Baird", "creator_id": 34505, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233609, "name": "The Who Films", "creator_id": 34504, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233607, "name": "Polytel", "creator_id": 25012, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50328", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [32307], "external_references": []}, {"id": 80049, "acmi_id": "324086", "title": "Pure Steam: Featuring the Flying Scotsman in Australia", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "pure-steam-featuring-the-flying-scotsman-in-australia", "creator_credit": "Peter Henshaw, Jim Revitt and Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1988", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>For almost a year the world&#8217;s most famous working steam locomotive, The Flying Scotsman 4472 from Britain, thrilled Australian steam enthusiasts from coast to coast.

&#8220;Death of apartheid&#8221;.<br />\nFinal part of a three-part television series covering the events in South Africa from 1985 to the democratic election in 1994. In 1992 a conference was held between the ruling National Party and the ANC to negotiate towards a free and fair election. Tentative agreement was reached. A further summit was held in April 1993 at the World Trade Centre near Johannesburg and finally it was agreed that the new Government would be formed on a power-sharing basis for five years, ie the National Party and the ANC and that the Cabinet, with its majority, freely able to make decisions without interference or vetoing from the minority National Party. The election date was set for April 1994. This decision angered the right-winged Afrikaners, particularly Eugene Terre&#8217;Blanche an extremist and eventual leader of the AWB (Afrikaner Resistance Movement). An alliance of 20 right-winged Afrikaner movements including AWB was formed and became known as the &#8220;Volksfront&#8221;. Their aim - a separate white state. At the same time, some of the 14 black tribal states (all of which would be abolished after the elections), along with the Zulu Inkatha movement, also fiercely opposed the ANC/National Party alliance and the months preceding the election saw once again violent attacks and demonstrations. It would be this strange alliance between the white Afrikaners and the black right-winged movements that would eventually bring their own downfall and pave the way for a democratic election to take place on 27 April 1994. On 10 May 1994 Nelson Mandela became the inaugural first President of Democratic South Africa with the ANC polling 63% of the vote, National Party 20% and Inkatha 10%.

This episode covers the history of Nelson Mandela&#8217;s imprisonment, the rise of the ANC (African National Congress) and Mandela&#8217;s eventual release. In 1961, realising that peaceful means was not bringing about change, the ANC began an armed struggle against the oppressive minority white South African government and its Apartheid system. By 1964 Mandela (an ANC leader) was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempting to cause a violent revolution and the ANC, along with the South African Communist Party, were banned, forcing many ANC leaders into exile. In the 1980s people took the liberation struggle to new heights. In the workplace, the community and in the schools, people aimed to take control of their situation. All areas of life became areas of political struggle. These struggles were linked to the demand for political power and for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela. There was also increasing anti-apartheid pressure from the outside world through sanctions, including economic sanctions, and in 1985, President PW Botha began secret talks for a peaceful resolution with Mandela (these negotiations taking place inside the prison walls). The talks would continue for four years until in 1989 Botha was replaced as President by FW De Klerk. 1989 also saw the end of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc - communism was becoming less of a threat and South Africa proclaimed the ANC &#8220;unbanned&#8221; in February 1990. With this unbanning also came Mandela&#8217;s unconditional release on 11 February 1990. Program includes interviews and commentary with Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela, PW Botha, FW De Klerk, Pik Botha, Kobie Coetsee (Justice Minister), Thabo Mbeki (ANC Executive), Desmond Tutu and others and features archival and newsreel footage (some parts in b&amp;w).

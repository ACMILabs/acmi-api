Rodolfo&#8217;s love for Mimi is a passionate and consuming affair which almost destroys their relationship. However love survives even in the face of hopelessness and despair. The spirit of the young Bohemian students, their gaiety and pathos masking the ensuing pain, is captured beautifully. Excellent performances by the lead singers supported by a complimentary cast including Jeffrey Mattsey, Francesco Ellero d&#8217;Artegna, Roberto Scaltriti, Guido Pasella.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884167, "name": "Valiant SRL Productions", "creator_id": 23501, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884168, "name": "Giancarlo Menotti", "creator_id": 36477, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 884166, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52405", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [33981], "external_references": []}, {"id": 83598, "acmi_id": "304852", "title": "La Boheme by Giacomo Puccini", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-boheme-by-giacomo-puccini", "creator_credit": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Geoffrey Nottage", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This opera in four acts was first performed at Turin on February 1, 1896.

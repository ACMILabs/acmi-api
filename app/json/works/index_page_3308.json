The feature-length &#8220;Too wise wives&#8221; is a droll satire about women&#8217;s place in society. Griffith&#8217;s short film &#8220;The Narrow road&#8221; and Tourneur&#8217;s feature &#8220;Alias Jimmy Valentine&#8221; both centre on ex-criminals caught amongst the devotion of a woman, the lure of criminal buddies and the suspicion of a dogged detective. Tourneur&#8217;s film is distinguished by its sophisticated visual style which can be attributed as much to his direction as to the contribution of set designer Ben Carre.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Study and teaching", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Silent films - United States - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women in the motion picture industry", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Study and teaching", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929044, "name": "Biograph Co", "creator_id": 80824, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126173", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929040, "name": "Crystal", "creator_id": 36498, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126458", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929043, "name": "Lois Weber Productions", "creator_id": 80823, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223499", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929042, "name": "Solax Co", "creator_id": 80822, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223505", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929041, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929045, "name": "World Film Corp", "creator_id": 80825, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143571", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52420", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 179, "name": "Unknown", "slug": "unknown"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [33996]}, {"id": 87006, "acmi_id": "308795", "title": "The Original adventures of Betty Boop", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-original-adventures-of-betty-boop", "creator_credit": "JEF Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1936", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Running for 20 minutes, these are three adventures from the animated queen of cute, Betty Boop! &#8220;Betty and Henry&#8221; (1935), sees Betty offer Henry a puppy if he&#8217;ll watch the store.

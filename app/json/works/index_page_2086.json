Filmmaker John Walker investigates the continued appeal of fairy lore in a world obsessed with materialism and rational thinking in this beautifully filmed documentary filled with the stunning landscapes that have fuelled tales of fairy folk for generations. He travels to the moors of England, the Highlands of Scotland, and sacred sites within Ireland and Cape Breton, discussing the origins of fairy lore, sightings of &#8220;the little people&#8221; and modern attitudes to the fairy faith. Walker interviews artist Brian Froud and reveals the inspiration for his fairy artworks, discusses the reality and physical possibility of fairies with scholar in seeing the paranormal Dr. Mark Fox, and meets Eddie Lenihan, a storyteller who saves an old fairy thorn tree from being destroyed by town developers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Folklore", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Legends", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ Legends", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Literature&nbsp;→ Folklore", "Literature&nbsp;→ Legends", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915267, "name": "John Walker Productions", "creator_id": 36024, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915268, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915269, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 74135, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915270, "name": "Kent Martin", "creator_id": 77370, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915271, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 74135, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 915266, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

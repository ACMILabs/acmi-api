Charles &#8220;Bud&#8221; Tingwell plays Andreas, an elderly widow who is undergoing a reflective period in his life marked by clarity and melancholy. A sentimental, rather impetuous man, Andreas longs for the woman he had a fleeting though passionate affair with over 40 years ago. &#8220;Innocence&#8221; begins with the re-encounter of Andreas and Claire (Julia Blake) and traces their flowering love and deep mutual affection. It&#8217;s a reunion that reawakens a love which has laid dormant for many years and that turns them both into young lovers: they become nervous before their first sexual encounter; they long for each other&#8217;s company at every moment afterward.

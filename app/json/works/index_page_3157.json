Though not showing all 22 screens of the Think presentation, the 9 screens included in this film still convey much of the visual richness of the presentation in an effort to help general audiences see problem solving on a large scale (such as urban planning) as being closely related to problem solving on a personal level. This single screen version is a marvellous synthesis of the imagery. Shows that both simple and complex problems are solved in the same manner and traces the steps in the problem solving process. Conveys them importance of abstract models in problem solving and demonstrates various types of models. Also shows the role of the computer in solving complex problems and emphasises how the simplification of a problem may aid in defining its essential nature. Follows five steps: 1. Stating the problem; 2. Collecting information; 3. Abstracting the information; 4. Building the model; 5. Manipulating the model.

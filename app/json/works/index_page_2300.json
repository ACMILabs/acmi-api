Using evocative sounds and images, Makhmalbaf (Kandahar, Gabbeh) has created an amazing piece of experimental and controversial filmmaking in &#8220;The Marriage of the blessed&#8221; which for all its political and social commentary, managed to escape the religious censorship by the Iranian regime of the time. Cast includes Mohsen Zehtab, Ebrahim Abadi, Hossein Moslemi with cinemaphotography by Ali Reza Zarindest. In Farsi with English subtitles.

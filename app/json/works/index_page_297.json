This is a special two-part set containing the full length television version of Fanny and Alexander, running in total over 5 hours, 2 hours longer than the theatrical release version. Told through the eyes of a small boy, this most personal of Bergman&#8217;s works is both autobiographical and an artistic reference point. Set during turn-of- the-century Sweden, the story is about the well-to-do, loving and ebullient Ekdahl family. When the actor-father of 10 year old Alexander and 8 year old Fanny dies, their mother marries a sadistic minister. His cruelty leads Grandmother Eckdahl&#8217;s Jewish friend and lover to rescue them. Happiness and balance is restored. Announced as Bergman&#8217;s final film, it offers a superlative culmination of his 37 years as one of cinema&#8217;s greatest artists. Oscar Winner 1982 for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

He has an outrageous recurring hallucination of Humphrey Bogart coaching him on how to make it with the ladies. His married friends, Dick and Linda fix him up with several eligible young ladies, but his self-confidence is low and it makes for a series of hilarious tragi-comic scenes where he fails dismally at every attempt he makes to impress. Eventually he discovers that there has been one woman all along who is right for him - his best friend&#8217;s wife! The final scene is a brilliant spoof of &#8220;Casablanca&#8221;, complete with trench coats and heavy fog. Also stars Diane Keaton as Linda.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/play-it-again-sam", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1987084, "name": "Herbert Ross", "creator_id": 25299, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q711415", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987083, "name": "Arthur P.

However, when she loses the money her mother has given her, young Razieh and her brother seek their fortunes in modern day Tehran. This visually ravishing contemporary retelling of &#8220;The Red Balloon&#8221;, reveals much about the culture of the Muslim world. By filming through a child&#8217;s eyes, director Jafar Panahi reveals a world of incidental cruelty, a world which often rushes by too fast to listen to the desires of children. There is a darkness in &#8220;The White Balloon&#8221;, not explicit, but a sadness about the opportunities adults lose in understanding the world of their child. As in all the best fairy-tales, this is a profoundly humane story. The screenplay is by acclaimed director Abbas Kiarostami. Winner of the Camera D&#8217;Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Arabic"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Iran", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954286, "name": "Jafar Panahi", "creator_id": 64306, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954285, "name": "Ferdos Films", "creator_id": 27481, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954284, "name": "Ferdos Films", "creator_id": 27481, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954283, "name": "Dendy Films", "creator_id": 27284, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954282, "name": "CMI", "creator_id": 27480, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954287, "name": "Abbas Kiarostami", "creator_id": 71903, "role": "screenwriter", "role_id": 601, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 954281, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18253, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bamJR4MwtQDMdWkjVAPojfwOjY4.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The White balloon (Jafar Panahi) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 800, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41484", "production_places": [{"id": 189, "name": "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "slug": "iran-islamic-republic-of"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [24975]}]}

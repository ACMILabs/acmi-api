Many of these elements are touched on in this program in order to come to terms with the history and current experience of the community through interviews with past and present residents, teachers and students from neighbouring schools, the Park&#8217;s designer and architect and through commentary from journalist Robert Fulford and the documentary&#8217;s director, Andrew Faiz, himself a former resident.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Housing", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Housing", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Housing", "Places&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 817341, "name": "Andrew Faiz", "creator_id": 80525, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817340, "name": "Gerry Flahive", "creator_id": 80524, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817339, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 66965, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817338, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51695", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33373]}]}

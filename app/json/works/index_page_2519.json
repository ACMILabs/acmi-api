The ageing poet knows he is dying (as indeed Cocteau was) and his greatest desire is to be reborn so that he can qualify for celestial immortality. This film is beautiful because it is the film of a man who knows he is going to die and still cannot take death seriously. Absurdity and grace are the two faces of the same medal that the poet throws into his night and falls back into our darkness&#8221;. Reference: Les Cahiers du Cinema, April  1960.

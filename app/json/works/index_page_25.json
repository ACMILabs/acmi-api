The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film shows scenes of Sydney and the Blue Mountains, NSW around 1936. There are some wonderful views of Sydney&#8217;s waterways including some houses on the lower cliffs, a few bays and a glimpse of the Harbour Bridge. Whilst in the Mountains we see walkers and horseback riding.</p>\n<p>Later in the film there are scenes at an air terminal where one of the early Australian air services, the &#8216;Australian National Airways (ANA)&#8217; is operating. The ANA was established by Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm in 1930 (ceasing in 1931).</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:12:00 family members looking out over the sea from high cliff tops<br />\n00:01:20:00, a woman is perched perilously close to the edge of the cliff whilst looking out over the view with her companions<br />\n00:02:03:00 small boats appear in the water below<br />\n00:02:17:00 family member wandering along a bush track under gums<br />\n00:02:50:00 view of the &#8216;Three Sisters&#8217; at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains<br />\n00:03:14:00 member of the family on horseback<br />\n00:03:30:00 lots of handshaking and goodbyes at what we see is an air terminal, precedes an &#8216;Australian National Airways&#8217; plane taking off.

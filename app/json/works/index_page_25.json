The novel by Henry Handel Richardson was published in 1910, and was so shocking at the time that the author&#8217;s name (Ethel Richardson) was stricken from the records of the school in which she set the thinly-disguised autobiography. An amusing and sometimes touching story which features an excellent performance from Barry Humphries as the repressed fire and brimstone minister. Also stars John Waters, Sheila Helpman, Patricia Kennedy and Julie Blake.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:08:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Boarding schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - Australia", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - History - Victoria", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Schools - Australia", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Schools - Victoria", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Women - Education", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature, Australian", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1305630, "name": "Bruce Beresford", "creator_id": 13900, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1305629, "name": "Phillip Adams", "creator_id": 70455, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1305628, "name": "Australian Film Commission", "creator_id": 66813, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1305627, "name": "Southern Cross Film Productions", "creator_id": 27699, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1305641, "name": "Barry Humphries", "creator_id": 76692, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305640, "name": "John Waters", "creator_id": 76444, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305639, "name": "Sigrid Thornton", "creator_id": 72926, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305638, "name": "Kerry Armstrong", "creator_id": 78026, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305637, "name": "Terence Donovan", "creator_id": 76209, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305636, "name": "Maggie Kirkpatrick", "creator_id": 75585, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305635, "name": "Jan Friedl", "creator_id": 78025, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305634, "name": "Julia Blake", "creator_id": 76446, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305633, "name": "Susannah Fowle", "creator_id": 78024, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305632, "name": "Don McAlpine", "creator_id": 74228, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1305631, "name": "Eleanor Witcombe", "creator_id": 217, "role": "screenwriter", "role_id": 601, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41665", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [25151]}, {"id": 85660, "acmi_id": "307072", "title": "Don's Party", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dons-party", "creator_credit": "Bruce Beresford, Phillip Adams and Art House Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Bruce Beresford&#8217;s classic Australian comedy exposes Australian social mores in the suburbs.

Through a conceptual focus in the screen images on the interiors of large designer furnishing outlets and the cross cutting of footage on one screen between these public interiors and private dwellings which feature similar furnishings, the realm of private and public is increasing blurred and their boundaries rendered increasingly ambiguous. On a large rear projection screen, a group of characters sit and discuss private thoughts and issues in a designer furniture showroom, a further problematic to the division between private and public space. An ambient soundtrack along with two discrete soundscapes including dialogue from a group of characters and original music, will also inform the atmosphere of the installation, itself furnished as a room in a generic designer home.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["two-channel video, projection, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1728979, "name": "David Rosetzky", "creator_id": 9248, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1728980, "name": "David Rosetzky", "creator_id": 9248, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "visual artist", "role_id": 493, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2719", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "This work is a commission for the Exemplary Works Collection and is be exhibited in the ACMI + NGV 2004 Exhibition.", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [53675], "external_references": []}]}

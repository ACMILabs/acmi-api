The artist combines these materials to critique and shatter binary thinking of natural and unnatural as separate, instead embracing the complexity and blur of binaries. ‘How are we able to unleash from the constraints of “nature” to find new pleasures? A Post-nature embrace of all that is and will be, even if it&#8217;s toxic?’ Duffy questions.</p>\n<p><i>Spawn</i> is also a work about gratitude. A filmic study of death and transformation.

No more cops killing our mob!”, vocalising demands of environmental, political and social concern, and reflecting the broad diversity within contemporary Indigenous urban society.</p>\n<p>Rennie was taught martial arts by his father while growing up in Melbourne’s inner West. <i>What Do We Want?</i> marries his 25-year history of martial arts and his arts practice, while expanding Rennie’s evolving moving image repertoire into the realm of performance.</p>\n<p><i>What Do We Want?</i> takes influence from martial arts films including Blaxploitation films of the 1970s and 80s; utilising the medium to make a statement about authenticity, respect, bravery and collective power. The students in <i>What Do We Want?</i> become a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>Displayed in the gallery in a massive three-channel video installation, the work loudly and proudly conveys the diversity of First Nations peoples, and the ongoing fight for justice that unifies them, raising urgent questions that require action and response.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Director: Reko Rennie</p>\n<p>Produced by Film Camp, Philippa Campey, Molly O&#8217;Connor</p>\n<p>Original composition by A.B.

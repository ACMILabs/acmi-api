Douglas’s home movies captured aspects of life in Australia’s major cities as well as in regional areas, often with a focus on public areas, transport or infrastructure projects. A collection of his films has been donated to ACMI by a member of Douglas’s family.</p>\n<p>This film captures some of the highlights of Sydney in 1962 – the harbour and bridge, memorials, gardens, building sites and streets and historic houses, as well as people working, fishing, playing bowls, sailing and catching ferries. There is a focus on traffic and cars around the inner Sydney area such as a wonderful scene of a double decker bus and taxis of the era.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:10:00 title &#8216;Sydney 1962&#8217;<br />\n00:00:14:00 a man is wandering around the Sydney University campus<br />\n00:01:00:00 views of Sydney whilst driving through traffic<br />\n00:01:34:00 Lennox Bridge at Parramatta.<br />\n00:01:44:00 a sign for Windsor followed by footage of historic houses<br />\n00:03:22:00 Sydney Harbour Bridge and ferry<br />\n00:06:31:00 Sydney Anzac Memorial<br />\n00:06:46:00 City Bowling Club<br />\n00:07:09:00 Sydney &#8216;El Alamein Memorial Fountain&#8217;<br />\n00:07:20:00 scenes at &#8216;Vaucluse House&#8217;<br />\n00:07:54:00 yachts sailing around the harbour<br />\n00:08:38:00 an Ansett seaplane at a pier<br />\n00:08:48:00 people fishing of a small pier<br />\n00:08:56:00 Sydney double decker bus and taxis<br />\n00:10:30:00 Rural Bank of NSW building<br />\n00:11:20:00 large excavation at a building site leaving a narrow house standing to the side<br />\n00:12:05:00 ferry &#8216;Kooleen&#8217;

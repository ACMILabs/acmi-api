"<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains family gatherings for birthdays and weddings as well as Christmas in 1979, a picnic in the Eastern Gardens in Geelong, a trip to Cairns and a tennis tournament in Launceston, Tasmania.

are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film Les and Dorothy Nixon show off their first baby Karen (who features in the Nixon Collection until she is an adult herself) at their home in Herne Hill, Geelong, Victoria. There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking. As well as these usual baby activities we see them in the context of the 1960s - style of clothes, carseat, bassinette, pram and playpen.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:25:00 infant Karen being carried around the family backyard by teenage girls, (possibly cousins in the large extended Corry-Nixon family)<br />\n00:01:02:00 family members climb a rock formation, followed by views of surrounding scenery<br />\n00:01:15:00 scenes of baby Karen’s christening or baptism day (assumed by the style of baby clothes and blanket and by Dorothy’s smart outfit which includes matching hat, gloves and necklace)<br />\n00:01:37:00 baby Karen being held by her grandmother and great aunt<br />\n00:01:47:00 baby Karen with father Len<br />\n00:02:19:00 baby Karen laughing in her bassinette<br />\n00:02:30:00 a family gathering for a beach picnic<br />\n00:04:11:00 extended family members gather for a photo with baby Karen<br />\n00:05:45:00 baby Karen being fed from a bowl, while she sits in her bassinette on the back porch of the home followed by a bath<br />\n00:06:54:00 a ‘dummy’ (pacifier or soother) hanging from above the bassinette<br />\n00:07:11:00 extended family members gather in front of one of their homes for a group scene; one of the women flits across the screen playfully swinging her skirt for the camera<br />\n00:08:00:00 baby Karen with Dorothy<br />\n00:08:57:00 a Holden model car from the era<br />\n00:10:20:00 baby Karen’s new car seat<br />\n00:11:21:00 an older baby Karen with a cousin in the backyard<br />\n00:12:09:00 a very 1960s style wedding<br />\n00:12:12:00 baby Karen chases an empty cigarette pack across the carpet floor, practising her crawling<br />\n00:13:57:00 baby Karen in her pram<br />\n00:14:46:00 Les mowing the lawn<br />\n00:15:08:00 first steps for Karen, with dad<br />\n00:15:30:00 at the beach, splashing around in the sea with cousins<br />\n00:16:25:00 family members paddle boarding and surfing<br />\n00:17:38:00 Karen wearing a sunbonnet in a &#8216;playpen&#8217;<br />\n00:18:46:00 Karen playing and laughing with dad<br />\n00:19:17:00 a lovely little rowboat named &#8216;Sea Wyf&#8217;<br />\n00:20:14:00 Karen crawling and first steps<br />\n00:21:40:00 Karen &#8216;frosting&#8217; the window<br />\n00:21:56:00 a family picnic<br />\n00:24:01:00 women dressed in smart outfits including hats<br />\n00:24:09:00 1960s wedding in light blue<br />\n00:25:50:00 toddler Karen playing with bucket and spade at the beach<br />\n00:26:25:00 Karen and Les practise swimming with a board and family beach scenes<br />\n00:28:18:00 gladioli flowers in a vase, in the fashion of the day<br />\n00:30:43:00 public gardens</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 1]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Dorothy Nixon and Les Nixon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1963</p>", "description": "<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

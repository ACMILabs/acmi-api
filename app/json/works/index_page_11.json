Having such creative collaborators is the treasure of my life</i>.&#8221; – Deborah Kelly</p>\n<p><I>The Gods of Tiny Things</i> is a vast, microscopic Eden teeming with deities born from the pages of old magazines and encyclopedias, creating an exquisite collage of grotesque beauty and new mythologies. Combining the divine, mundane and profane, these celestial creations animate a kaleidoscopic symbology that explores extinction and the climate crisis, the scars of colonialism, and the political shift to the right around the world, while simultaneously revelling in the persistence of pleasure, desire and life. Created at ‘collage camp’ at Bundanon on beautiful Yuin Country, this collaborative work is a poetic and urgent warning.</p>\n<p>Deborah Kelly is a Sydney-based artist whose works have been shown around Australia, and in the Biennales of Singapore, Sydney, Thessaloniki, TarraWarra and Venice. Her projects across media are concerned with lineages of representation, politics and history in public exchange, and practices of collectivity on small and large scale, both fleeting and durational. Her newest works experiment with models of sustained creative collaboration between strangers. Kelly’s moving image artworks have been shown around the world, in galleries, cinemas and projected onto rock formations, buildings and clouds.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>The Gods of Tiny Things</i> is a vast, microscopic Eden teeming with deities born from the pages of old magazines and encyclopedias, creating an exquisite collage of grotesque beauty and new mythologies.

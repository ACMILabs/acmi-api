Officials mingle, and we see the &#8220;royal&#8221; in close-up. 00:02:21:00 the scene briefly shifts to Mildura weir, then an orchard (or vineyard) under irrigation. 00:02:37:00 back to the airfield, and more footage of the motorcade driving through streets. We then see a series of disconnected footage containing the royal couple waving to crowds from open car, in park and from a dais. 00:04:55:00 Crowd scenes of children at the park, including a parade carrying a &#8220;Mildura Legacy&#8221; banner. 00:05:40:00 we see a continuation of footage from previous Reels 20 &amp; 21, of the Queen and Duke visiting a private property to observe the grape harvest. This is mixed up with scenes of Mildura streets and street decorations, scenes showing the &#8220;floral carpet&#8221; and grape decorations on the dais setup for the visit, and footage of people waiting for, waving at, and meeting the Queen and Duke.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:09:32:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mildura (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Murray River (N.S.W.-S.

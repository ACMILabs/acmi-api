his acceptance of a Pascalian wager about faith, finds his beliefs challenged by an encounter with Maud, a free-thinking divorcee. She represents desire while Francoise - who he has observed from a distance at Mass - seems to represent, for him, a path to the attainment of grace. The ambiguous conflict between instinct and reason, nature and culture is worked through in this sharply observed comedy of manners, the third of Rohmer&#8217;s &#8216;Moral Tales&#8217; (filmed out of sequence) and set in a wintry Clermont-Ferrand. Although there are many ironic moments, Rohmer&#8217;s refusal to displace ambiguity with irony allows space for the viewer to find his/her own way through the thicket created between what is observed and the rationalisation of the narrator.

Before long Jack, under the influence of the magnetic Tyler, finds himself commandeering a terrorist organisation committed to smashing the American corporate state. Based on Chuck Palahniuk&#8217;s cult novel, director David Fincher deploys a swirling, kinetic and audacious mise-en-scene to represent the fragmented and hyper-alienated psychology of contemporary American society. Though the violene in the film is extreme, &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; is a highly satirical commentary on machismo and masculine insecurity. On its release, &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; was severly criticised for its elusive and contradictory politics; but contradiction is the essence of the society that the film examines. So this is a virulent anti-Capitalist movie financed by one of the world&#8217;s largest media multinationals&#8217; this is a feminist film that exalts in masculine aggression; this is a film that postulates that materialism has goen too far while utilising every state-of-the-art digital special effect available. It is always, however, exhilirating and provocative. Cast includes: Meat Loaf, Jared Leto and Helena Bonham Carter. Original soundtrack by The Dust Brothers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environmentally induced diseases", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Alienation (Philosophy)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Alienation (Philosophy)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Diseases", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Environmentally induced diseases", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Schizophrenia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fight-club", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2239090, "name": "David Fincher", "creator_id": 72479, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q184903", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239077, "name": "Art Linson", "creator_id": 56823, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q705631", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239078, "name": "Cean Chaffin", "creator_id": 79350, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q961183", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239089, "name": "Ross Grayson Bell", "creator_id": 56837, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239066, "name": "Fox 2000", "creator_id": 32151, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239072, "name": "Linson Films", "creator_id": 26686, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299330", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2239070, "name": "Regency Enterprises", "creator_id": 69843, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2239063, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47692", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [29942]}, {"id": 90446, "acmi_id": "313412", "title": "In a lonely place", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-a-lonely-place", "creator_credit": "Nicholas Ray, Robert Lord and Santana", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1950", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47438, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1305455"}], "brief_description": "<p>Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart), a neurotic and deeply disturbed screenwriter on the down-hill slide is accused of murdering the hatcheck girl of his favourite hang-out.

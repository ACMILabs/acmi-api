Moving with the times is not one of Whirling&#8217;s strong points and he takes exception to having a female press agent. In a bid to boost dwindling sales Whirling reluctantly agrees to allow Zack Colino, his top aerialist, to perform a media attention grabbing feat - crossing Niagara Falls on a tight rope. Humour, comedy and colour pervade the film that constitutes good-natured family fun, as well as consisting of some stunning stunts. Originally filmed in cinemascope, &#8220;The Big circus&#8221; features a star cast including Vincent Price, Peter Lorre and Red Buttons. This film was to be one of Mature&#8217;s last leading men roles.

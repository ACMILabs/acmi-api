Images of the architecture, temples, cultural traditions and ceremonies are also a highlight. The film shows pottery techniques and a pottery ware market. There is footage of a funeral procession and a traditional Balinese temple festival or Odalan. The film shows elaborate offerings of fruit and food which is brought with great ceremony by the locals to the temple. We see Borobudur and surrounds, including details of the temple walls and structure.

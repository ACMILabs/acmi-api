In this animation, static photographs of cigarette butts have been edited together and played back in quick succession to give the illusion of motion.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional animation in which the setting is consistent and spatial continuity is maintained, in this work the background changes frantically. The flickering images recall flip-books, early cinema, and animation devices of the late nineteenth century, such as the zoetrope used by Eadweard Muybridge. Marclay’s animations set the discarded trails of rubbish in motion, giving the humble objects new life and transforming his chance encounters with trash into visual poetry. </p>\n<p>Sourced from Fraenkel Gallery: https://fraenkelgallery.com/exhibitions/christian-marclay-six-new-animations</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:00:51:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Digital video, bespoke artist box\nedition 4 of 6 (+2 artist's proofs)\nsingle channel 4:3 animation, colour, silent, continuous loop\nmedia player, two SD cards, archival USB drive"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1284425, "name": "Christian Marclay", "creator_id": 66905, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "180795", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2016", "notes": "", "to_year": "2016"}], "labels": [57489]}, {"id": 117865, "acmi_id": "AEO176991", "title": "Eastman Kodak Cine-Kodak Special II 16mm camera", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "eastman-kodak-cine-kodak-special-ii-16mm-camera", "creator_credit": "Eastman Kodak", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>Cine-Kodak Special II 16mm silent movie camera with two interchangeable lenses.

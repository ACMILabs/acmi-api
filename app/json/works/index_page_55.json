Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller. The films were made on Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains footage of a visit to the Gresswell Sanatorium in Mont Park, Victoria, which at the time housed and treated male patients with tuberculosis. Mont Park was an area north-east of Melbourne comprising several health institutions, including the Gresswell Sanatorium which was named after Dan Gresswell, a public health administrator. The film provides an insightful look at life in the sanatorium, including recreational activities and health care.</p>\n<p>This film was made on Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 great example of a handpainted sign reading &#8216;Repatriation Sanatorium, Drive Slow, Gresswell Sanatorium&#8217;<br />\n00:00:13:00 a 1940s style bus with logo &#8216;Heidelberg Motor Omnibus Service Pty.

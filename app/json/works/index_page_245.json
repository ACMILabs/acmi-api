With a broad comic tone, Australian idiosyncrasies (albeit familiar ones) - excessive swearing, drinking, smoking and jokes about the sexuality of octogenarians - abound. The gender roles are well defined; women in charge of baking, whilst mateship and honour are the ideals to which men aspire. Like &#8220;The Castle&#8221; (Rob Sitch, 1997) this film embraces the classic David versus Goliath structure, as the morally sound little man faces an evil corporate developer seeking to undermine a certain spirit and camaraderie of society. Melbourne comedian Judith Lucy plays Nance, a local reporter who becomes concerned for the future of the club and forms a romantic attachment to Jack. Also stars Samuel Johnson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Conflict of generations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Conflict of generations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Old age", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Conflict of generations", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Old age", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Lawn bowls"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/crackerjack", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963751, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963752, "name": "Macquarie Film Corporation", "creator_id": 36196, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963753, "name": "A Million Monkeys", "creator_id": 36197, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963754, "name": "Mick Molloy", "creator_id": 30169, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963755, "name": "Stephen Luby", "creator_id": 78775, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963756, "name": "Paul Moloney", "creator_id": 29250, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963750, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52174", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33793], "external_references": [{"id": 2088, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q12110058"}, {"id": 3872, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "14672"}]}]}

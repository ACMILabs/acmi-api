Tully Arnot&#8217;s virtual reality work Epiphytes honours alternative forms of plant communication and consciousness, inviting us to question our own perception. The primacy of sight is minimised in favour of sound and scent, which Arnot uses to influence our bodily responses within the virtual space. Epiphytes reflects Arnot&#8217;s interest in how emergent technologies help form human understandings of the world.</p>\n<p>Situated within an abstracted representation of Arnot&#8217;s childhood backyard, the environment features a diffuse, shifting, magenta palette - suggestive of a phytomorphic (plant-based) interpretation of light and space. The work includes interviews with evolutionary ecologist Monica Gagliano, acoustic archaeologist Umashankar Manthravadi and echolocation teacher/blind researcher and activist Thomas Tajo.</p>\n<p>Tully Arnot is one of Australia&#8217;s leading visual artists. Arnot&#8217;s practice explores the effect that contemporary technology has on human relationships, looking at the isolating nature of our increasingly connected, but ultimately disconnected world.

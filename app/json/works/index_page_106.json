The cast is uniformally excellent and Michael Caine won an Academy Award for his performance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:01:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adoption", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-cider-house-rules", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961720, "name": "Film Colony", "creator_id": 34821, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961721, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961722, "name": "Richard Gladstein", "creator_id": 34822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961723, "name": "Lasse Hallstrom", "creator_id": 23520, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961719, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50664", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32638], "external_references": [{"id": 1401, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q648977"}, {"id": 5725, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "1715"}]}, {"id": 98918, "acmi_id": "508872", "title": "The Chosen", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-chosen", "creator_credit": "Chosen Film Company, Edie Landau, Ely Landau and Jeremy Kagan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Based on the novel by Chaim Potok which explores the friendship that develops between two adolescent Jewish boys living in New York in the 1940s.

In a dramatic rainy scene we watch Ermeng, unable to cope with all the pressure these women are placing on him, runs off.<br />\nThen he faces his fears and decides to come back.<br />\nThe storehouse catches fire and despite their best efforts to put it out it perishes. Ermeng is injured figting the fire. The doctor tells Fengyue he might be crippled. His chances are looking slim, and this catastrophe brings out the true character of both of the women. It turns out that when the going gets tough, the pretty young Fengyue is not interested in doing the hard yards.<br />\nTherefore the widow Jin Zhu has a claim to him by default and gives him her snail shell, reminiscent of the story she told her son at the beginning of the film.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nAn insightful look at the household of a northern Chinese peasant home.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; June 10, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:39:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Handicapped - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Marriage customs and rites", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Handicapped - Family relationships", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales - China", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889931, "name": "Xi'an Film Studio", "creator_id": 22058, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889932, "name": "Guo Yangting", "creator_id": 82531, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889933, "name": "Tan Tan", "creator_id": 82532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889934, "name": "Lin Jing", "creator_id": 82533, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889935, "name": "Wang Yuzhang", "creator_id": 82534, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146429", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [55277], "external_references": []}, {"id": 77779, "acmi_id": "323744", "title": "A Wife among wives: notes on Turkana marriage", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-wife-among-wives-notes-on-turkana-marriage", "creator_credit": "Judith MacDougall and David MacDougall", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Turkana Conversations No. 2&#8221;.<br />\nThis film examines how an African tribe, the Turkana, views marriage.

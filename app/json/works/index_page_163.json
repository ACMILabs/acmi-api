Home Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 8mm and 9.5mm film between the 1940s and 1970s by Charles Edward Hayes (1914–1993). The resulting footage shows us the life of a family living in Heathmont in Melbourne&#8217;s south east with their many pets and farm animals, their family holidays and gatherings, their suburb and their cars as well as scenes from Melbourne at the time.</p>\n<p>This film shows snippets of family life while at play, at birthday celebrations and on holiday. We see the family drive across the bridge to Phillip Island and enjoy swimming and canoeing at the beach there. The reel also includes scenes of caravan camping, koalas and a trip to the war memorial at Mount Macedon. The family enjoy games of tennis, ball games and swings and roundabouts at a playground.

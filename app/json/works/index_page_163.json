She misses meeting up with a maharajah, and decides to stay with the rugged hunter instead. Enter anthropologist Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) and his wife Linda (Grace Kelly), who harbours a secret desire for Marswell who is also instantly taken by her - much to the disappointment of Honey Bear. Nordley has enlisted the help of the professional safari guide to take them on a gorilla documenting hunt. Women are not the only things causing Marswell trouble however, as the native African wildlife and a potential native uprising throw more perils into the mix. Based upon a play by Wilson Collison.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture remakes", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Safaris - Africa", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Motion picture remakes", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mogambo", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957279, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957280, "name": "Sam Zimbalist", "creator_id": 76868, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957281, "name": "John Ford", "creator_id": 62487, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957278, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45365", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [27927], "external_references": [{"id": 698, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1122534"}, {"id": 4887, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "25009"}]}, {"id": 90377, "acmi_id": "313331", "title": "Modern times", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "modern-times", "creator_credit": "Charles Chaplin", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1936", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This was, in effect, the swansong of the Tramp in what is basically a &#8216;silent&#8217; film which makes pointed use of synchronised speech at carefully selected moments.

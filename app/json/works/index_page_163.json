each of our heroes. Though he is initially defeated, he manages to escape from the animals&#8217; dead bodies and retreats to the heavens in order to safely plot his comeback.<br />\nThe band continue their journey into the land of Xiliang, the kingdom of women. The leader of our heroes, Monk Tripytaka (a.k.a. Xuanzang), is given an audience with the queen of Xiliang, who is rapt with sweet meloncholy, as she waits for her true love to grace the illustrious court. Yet it turns out she has been waiting a little too long to be picky about her men, and she falls instantly in love with the graceful young monk.<br />\nAfter she invites them all to rest for a while in her kingdom, the queen speaks with Xuanzang, explaining that she has been a maid for 30 years. When she propositions him and asks his hand in marriage Wukong intervenes and accepts on Xuanzang&#8217;s behalf, thus buying them some time to devise a plan of escape. Meanwhile, the Six-Eared Monkey listens in on their plan and devises a counter strategy to harrass them.<br />\nWukong turns himself into a copy of Xuangzhao and meets with the queen, who calls in her guards when she realises the hoax.

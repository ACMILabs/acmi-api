(Awards: John Boorman- Best Director 1998 Cannes Film festival)</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Based on the true life exploits of Irish gangster Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) who pulled off a series of daring robberies in the eighties, earning him the nickname, The General. John Boorman&#8217;s offbeat black and white biographical film (lensed by cinematographer Seamus Deasey), chronical&#8217;s Cahill&#8217;s blatent criminal reign and his eventual downfall, via an over-ambitious art heist. Boorman mines rich material from this unlikely hero who apart from having a very unorthodox relationship with two sisters (Angeline Ball, Maria Doyle Kennedy), became a folk hero in Dublin because of his open contempt for authority and his ongoing battle with the Irish police force. Gleeson&#8217;s performance is aptly understated, choosing to portray Cahill as an enigmatic figure forever concealing his face. Jon Voight as the frustrated police inspector obsessively in pursuit of Cahill makes a fine and sympathetic adversary. Cast also includes Adrian Dunbar and Sean McGinley.

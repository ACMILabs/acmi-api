Martin finds success as a fashion model and begins a tentative sexual relationship with the shy Alice. But when Martin hears that she has fallen pregnant this results in a breakdown where the shattering truth of what occurred during his disappearance threatens to destroy him and his relationship. As Techine showed in his earlier work, &#8220;Wild Reeds&#8221;, he is a master of acute observations of human need and desire. The fractured individuals at the heart of &#8220;Alice and Martin&#8221; are all seeking solace and safety. Neither detachedly bleak nor fashionably cynical, Techine&#8217;s work recalls the strong humanist tradition in French cinema: he is certainly Jean Renoir&#8217;s heir. But this is no revisionist or conservative cinema. Techine&#8217;s fine intimate portraits are alive to both the possibilities of cinema and the complex sexual and gender relationships at the core of modern life. With Carmen Maura.

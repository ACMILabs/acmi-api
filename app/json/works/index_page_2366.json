Evocatively shot in black and white by Robby Muller, with a script by Agnieszka Holland and directed by established Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, &#8220;Korczak&#8221; is a deeply moving story about the unspeakable horrors of the Holocaust and the choice to face racial discrimination and genocide with dignity and resolve. The film&#8217;s finale, however, provides one of the most magical sequences in the history of cinema. In Polish with English subtitles.

Kaurismaki&#8217;s films capture a deadpan humour framed within a melancholic society where the protagonists, as if frozen, become still lives perfectly matched to the poverty of their environment (captured by the superb cinematography of Timo Salminen). Set in London (and in the English language), &#8220;I Hired a contract killer&#8221; is a slow meditation on loneliness and isolation within a dehumanised industrial setting. After fifteen years of loyal service to his company, Henri Boulanger (Jean-Pierre Leaud), a lone migrant, is fired on the spot. In his despair he hires a contract killer after several unsuccessful attempts at suicide. But best laid plans can go wrong&#8230;almost immediately after arranging the contract, Henri&#8217;s faith in humanity is restored when he falls in love with Margaret (Margi Clarke), another loner. Henri is now in a race against time as he endeavors to have his contract cancelled.

Iris (Kati Outinen) works in a factory supporting her cruel mother and stepfather. Her dreams of escaping the life are shattered when &#8216;love&#8217; turns out to be another part of the misery. Numbed by the present and burdened by her past, Iris&#8217;s rage catapults her into the future.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>I Hired a contract killer.

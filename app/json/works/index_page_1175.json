Guy Pearce is excellent as the youngest drag queen who has a tough mouth but a lot to learn about the world, while Hugo Weaving is moving as a man who must reveal the truth of his homosexuality to his son. Terence Stamp is unforgettable as the transgendered Bernice and the loving relationship that develops between Stamp and Bill Hunter&#8217;s outback &#8220;bloke&#8221; is very tender and touching. </p>\n<p>Full of humour, colour and bizarre costumes for which the film won an Academy Award, <i>Priscilla</i> is a wickedly entrancing family movie which shows that not only Australian cities but the mythical Australian bush has been affected and changed by ethnic and sexual multiculturalism. The soundtrack is full of great drag disco classics from &#8216;I Will Survive&#8217; and &#8216;Go West&#8217; to the more recent &#8216;Finally&#8217; and &#8216;Save the Best for Last&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["MA", "Mediatheque - not for children (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Comedy", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Abba (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Disco dancing"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 233}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-adventures-of-priscilla-queen-of-the-desert", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1766153, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2094420", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766152, "name": "Michael Hamlyn", "creator_id": 732, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766151, "name": "Al Clark", "creator_id": 731, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2636034", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766150, "name": "Specific Films", "creator_id": 26836, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1766149, "name": "Latent Image", "creator_id": 26835, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1766157, "name": "Hugo Weaving", "creator_id": 73711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1766156, "name": "Terrence Stamp", "creator_id": 77763, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1766155, "name": "Bill Hunter", "creator_id": 76434, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1766154, "name": "Guy Pearce", "creator_id": 77762, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1766148, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40929", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [24450], "external_references": [{"id": 237, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q255328"}]}]}

The crew of the submarine are exposed to a myriad of dangers (not the least of which is madness) as they hunt and are in turn hunted throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans. Much of the film was shot in a real submarine to create a genuinely claustrophobic atmosphere. The film features little dialogue and goes to great lengths to display the boredom of the crew as they wait for instructions, and the terror that ensues when they do.

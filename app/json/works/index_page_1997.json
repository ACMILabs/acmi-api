Ellen, an ambitious but somewhat frosty Harvard graduate working at &#8216;New York Magazine&#8217; as a writer, is dominated by her father, George, a literary professor and critic and her mother, Kate, a homemaker and perfectionist who reflects the middle-America values and priorities that Ellen scorns. With Kate unwell, George asks that Ellen return home as carer - a role which Ellen resents, as it will take her away from her boyfriend and literary career in New York. &#8220;One true thing&#8221;, a high-brow tearjerker, utilises melodrama to portray the central conflict of the family that is always subtly at war with itself. At times turgid and predictable the drama is nevertheless effective, mostly due to the strong performances of the three lead actors as they portray adults bourgeoning with thwarted desires and misplaced loyalties.

It is the story of the Heidelberg School of artists, written by Bill Garner and based on an original idea by Humphrey McQueen. Episode two provides a more intimate portrayal of the artists and introduces Sydney artist Charles Condor to Tom Roberts&#8217; clique of Melbourne based painters. However Condor&#8217;s philosophy and style of symbolism and nature, and his penchant for the more exotic and bohemian way of life begin to clash with Roberts&#8217; realistic and business approach to painting almost causing a split in the infant Australian movement. It is an old farmhouse at Eaglemont that brings Roberts, Streeton and Condor together to paint, to intellectualise and to leisure along with Jane Sutherland, Fred and Annie McCubbin, Clara Southern and others of the Melbourne fraternity of artists. It is also here that gives birth to the &#8220;9 by 5 Impression Exhibition&#8221; - a concept originating from Roberts to break through the conservativism of the middle and upper-class patrons of art and to establish his passion for a school of Australian painting. Roberts emphatically believed in realism and his search for the Australian identity and character begins to be realised in his work during this period. Jane Sutherland finds however that women are still being discriminated against, even within the Roberts group. The &#8220;9 by 5&#8221; was for the boys only and did not include any paintings by women. Features some wonderful images and historic buildings of Melbourne along with several works by the artists.

An apparently happily married man has his bourgeois complacency shattered by the discovery of his wife&#8217;s infidelity. Murder is a sudden eruption that only momentarily shatters the niceties of middle class life. Chabrol is neither entirely cynical nor wholly compassionate in his cool dissection of a bourgeois marriage. This film is the first of a trilogy on adultery known as the &#8216;Helene&#8217; series (all starring Chabrol&#8217;s then wife, Stephane Audran) including &#8216;La Rupture/The Breakup&#8217;. In French with English subtitles. Cast includes Stephane Audran, Michel Bouquet, Michel Duchaussoy and Maurice Ronet. The film was remade in 2002 as &#8216;Unfaithful&#8217; (directed by Adrian Lyne) also scripted by Chabrol.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ New wave films&nbsp;→ New wave films - France", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997860, "name": "Claude Chabrol", "creator_id": 25145, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55375", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997859, "name": "Andre Genoves", "creator_id": 31905, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1424934", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997858, "name": "Cinegai", "creator_id": 35271, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997857, "name": "Les Films La Boetie", "creator_id": 31903, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51079", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1969", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1969"}], "labels": [33011], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93507, "acmi_id": "316960", "title": "Love and human remains", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "love-and-human-remains", "creator_credit": "Denys Arcand, Roger Frappier, Max Films and Atlantis Films Limited", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Denys Arcand (Jesus of Montreal) directs &#8220;Love and human remains&#8221;, a tale of love and longing set in an anonymous Canadian city.

Evora (born 1941) has brought the unique sounds of her birthplace, known as &#8216;morna&#8217; - a slow, rhythmic song form that is a mix of blues, jazz and Portuguese folk - to world attention. Her magnificent voice and soulful singing is often accompanied by the acoustic sounds of guitar, cavaquinho, violin, accordion, and clarinet, in a expressive, lyrical style. Evora&#8217;s music conveys the struggles of her people and melancholy of their history.

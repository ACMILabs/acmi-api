But as the series progresses, the ever watchful eye of the Feds becomes less important than the personal experiences of the New Jersey crime family. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is still in therapy and though he is still baiting psychoanalyst Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), he is getting closer to understanding the source of his anxiety attacks: they are triggered by memories of his violent childhood. But with the death of his mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), Tony has to deal with the twin demons of rage and guilt. Tony also has to deal with his daughter Meadow&#8217;s awakening sexuality (including her falling in love with a black man) as well as with the spiritual angst of his wife, Carmella (Edie Falco), who is increasingly disturbed by the ethical implications of her being a partner to a mobster. It&#8217;s only when he meets the beautiful Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) that things start looking up for Tony, but soon, in true Soprano&#8217;s style, her emotional instability creates a dangerous domestic situation for him. Outstanding episodes in this series include &#8220;Employee of the month&#8221;, which deals with the rape of Dr. Melfi, the black comedy of &#8220;Pine barrens&#8221;, directed by Steve Buscemi, and the horrifying violence of &#8220;University&#8221; which features the abusive relationship between a mobster and one of the strippers at the Bada Bing. The dark exploration of masculinity, abuse and violence which is central to this episode exemplifies what is unique to The Sopranos: terrific writing, outstanding performances and a daring audacity to fully explore the brutality of contemporary culture.

Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), though ostensibly in the Waste Management business is really one of the heads of a large Mafia family. When the series begins he is disturbed by the on-set of a mid-life crisis in which the arrival of a nest of ducks in the family swimming pool precipitates dizzy-spells and increasingly disturbing dreams. He begins secret sessions with a psychiatrist, played by Lorraine Bracco, in which he slowly divulges the issues in his life. They include dealing with the suspicions of his intelligent Catholic wife, Carmella (Edie Falco); the traumas of seeing his daughter, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), leave adolescence behind and prepare for College; and his concerns with his slacker son, Anthony Junior (Robert Iler). On top of this he has to deal with the constant undermining by his tough-bitch mother (Nancy Marchand) and the wheeling and dealing of his uncle, Junior (Dominic Chianese). Its only when he is with his &#8220;boys&#8221;, the &#8220;capos&#8221; that form his Mafia Crew - Paulie (Tony Sirico), Christopher (Michael Imperioli) and Silvio (Steven Van Zandt) - that Tony can relax. But even then, business always intrudes &#8230; With a consistently brilliant cast, tough and witty writing and a complex examination of materialism and contemporary American society, &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; manages to create an ambiguous moral epic out of its study of power, corruption and money. Violent and uncompromising, the series delivers a narrative sweep that has the breadth of the classical nineteenth century novel but its language, vision and cynicism plants it firmly in the twenty-first. Created by David Chase and featuring direction by noted independent directors such as Nick Gomez, &#8220;The Sopranos&#8221; deserves the acclaim heaped upon it. In its moral complexity, insight and daring it leaves the products of the Hollywood motion picture industry for dead.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Sopranos.

Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), though ostensibly in the Waste Management business is really one of the heads of a large Mafia family. When the series begins he is disturbed by the on-set of a mid-life crisis in which the arrival of a nest of ducks in the family swimming pool precipitates dizzy-spells and increasingly disturbing dreams.

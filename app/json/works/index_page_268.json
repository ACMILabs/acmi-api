Excerpts from films such as Annie Sprinkle&#8217;s Linda, Les, and Annie (1990), Texas Tomboy&#8217;s Alienator (1997), Monika Treut&#8217;s Max (1992), Jordy Jones&#8217; Injectible Man (1998), and Shu Lea Cheang&#8217;s web feature Brandon (1998) are also interspersed with the interview footage. This documentary had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival Panorama in February 1999.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Germany", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Femininity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex differences", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hormones", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hormones - Physiological effect", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medical care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sex (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Surgery"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/gendernauts-a-journey-through-shifting-identities", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961811, "name": "Hyena Films", "creator_id": 33234, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961812, "name": "Monika Treut", "creator_id": 76511, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q69810", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50712", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32677], "external_references": [{"id": 42, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q799096"}, {"id": 4254, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "49477"}]}, {"id": 89498, "acmi_id": "312297", "title": "Gattaca [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gattaca-dvd", "creator_credit": "Jersey Films, Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher and Andrew Niccol", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Niccol&#8217;s debut as a director, a year before he wrote the script for &#8216;The Truman Show&#8217;, is set in a near-future where the lives of the majority of citizens are determined before birth through genetic engineering of their genes, and the &#8216;natural-born&#8217; minority of &#8216;In-Valids&#8217; is shunned.

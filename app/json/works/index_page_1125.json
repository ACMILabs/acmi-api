The battle skills of the Britons are undeniably the equal of Caesar&#8217;s Roman troops. However, they are handicapped by their habit of refusing to fight on weekends and leaving the battlefield promptly at five every afternoon in time for tea. Whilst the Britons are caught napping after dinner, the Romans win the war and overrun Britain. A plea from the English leader, Zebigboss, goes out to the mighty Asterix and his Roman-hating friend Obelix. Join all the familiar friends in this great adventure including Druid Getafix, Dogmatix, Chief Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and many more.

Terrorism has been around for centuries but the attack on the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York took terrorism on to another level - 2,800 people died out of an estimated 14,000 people who were in the towers when two jet planes, hijacked by terrorists, hit.

This program presents an indepth look at the history of the Twin Towers, from their inception through to Ground Zero in an attempt to explain the reasons why they did collapse and why so many people died.

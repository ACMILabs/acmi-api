"<p>Episode of Series &#8220;What Do You Think&#8221;.<br />\nThis film invites discussion of whether, in business competition, one&#8217;s standards of fair play should be lowered. The question revolves around two young women who seek the same job. While one has already applied for the position and is reasonably sure of getting it, she lessens her chances by telling the other that applications are still being accepted. A third woman questions the first&#8217;s &#8220;softness&#8221; and the audience is asked to judge.

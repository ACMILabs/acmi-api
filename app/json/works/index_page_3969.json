Refuting the bourgeois narratives of modernism, the richly sensuous trilogy was Pasolini&#8217;s attempt to return to a folkloric and pre-modern storytelling tradition rooted in the oral traditions of the peasantry. Filmed in stunning locations in the Africa, Asia and the Middle East, &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; consists of tales within tales, a weaving of fairy stories all connected by their illustration of the intrinsic power of the human search for love and sex. Utilising a circular device based on the original stories of the &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221;, the film begins with Aziz (Ninnetto Davoli) falling in love with Zumarud (Ines Pellegrini). When they are separated by the evil machinations of a slave dealer, Aziz begins a search for his lost love.

Refusing the colonialist identification of Arab and Oriental society with sexual repression and ignorance, Pasolini affirms the sensual and complex civilisations of the pre-Talmudic and pre-Koranic worlds. Set amongst some of the most spectacular architectural monuments and cityscapes of the Islamic and Buddhist world, the film is a continuous feast for all the senses.

The visionary horror director, David Cronenberg, combines film-noir, horror and science-fiction to recreate Burrough&#8217;s expressionistic journey into a writer&#8217;s soul: an examination of the terrifying link between insanity and artistic inspiration. In a dream-like North African city, a group of American writers and artists immerse themsleves in drugs and sex, and occassionally in their artistic pursuits. Based closely on Burrough&#8217;s relationship with his wife - whom he accidentally killed - &#8220;The Naked Lunch&#8221;, though a novel that owes much to the grammar of cinema, was long considered unfilmable. Cronenberg&#8217;s attempt is audacious and ultimately successful. With Judy Davis, Peter Weller, Julian Sands and Roy Scheider. The haunting musical score is by Ornette Coleman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Expressionism in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Literature&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "People&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 781600, "name": "David Cronenberg", "creator_id": 8722, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55422", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1809721, "name": "Jeremy Thomas", "creator_id": 62126, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1365966", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781598, "name": "Naked Lunch Productions", "creator_id": 25351, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781597, "name": "Recorded Picture Company", "creator_id": 22966, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3422434", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 781596, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39108", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [22682]}, {"id": 115959, "acmi_id": "X000124", "title": "Continental Circus", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "continental-circus", "creator_credit": "Jerome Laperrousaz and Jacques Zajderman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46991, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2995656"}], "brief_description": "<p>The racing careers and exploits of two contrasting characters are explored in this French documentary about small motorcycle racing.

All the cast is outstanding but special mention must be made of the majestic Angelica Huston: her blazing and frightening performance as Lily is unforgettable.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Set in the sleazy horse-tracks and gambling dens of contemporary L.A., &#8220;The Grifters&#8221; is a modern crime film that compares favourably to classic Hollywood film-noir films. Based on Jim Thompson&#8217;s pulp classic of the same name, this film shimmers with a consistent erotic tension. John Cusack is Roy, a young con-man who makes easy money off the gullible hordes that crowd Los Angeles. He finds himself caught in the middle of a dangerous tug-of-war between his prostitute girlfriend (Annette Bening) who wants him to committ a major scam, and his elegant but desperate mother, Lily (Angelica Huston), who has been hustling for years and wants to find a way out. Both are powerful women not adverse to using the people they love to get what they want, and their desperate machinations to achieve financial independance puts Roy&#8217;s very life at risk. This brilliantly directed film is a powerful study on the corrosive effects of power and money on human relationships. All the cast is outstanding but special mention must be made of the majestic Angelica Huston: her blazing and frightening performance as Lily is unforgettable.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-grifters", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2353223, "name": "Stephen Frears", "creator_id": 71762, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55258", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353220, "name": "Jim Painten", "creator_id": 77574, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353217, "name": "Robert A.

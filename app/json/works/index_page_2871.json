Mr Jordan, a senior official in heaven, (James Mason) seeks to set things in order by offering Joe a place back on earth in the body of another mortal. After seeing environmental lobbyist Betty Logan (Julie Christie) Joe decides to inhabit the body of Leo Farnsworth, a rich amoral industrialist who is in danger from his murderous wife (Dyan Cannon) and her lover (Charles Grodin). When Joe decides to get Pendleton&#8217;s body into shape he engages the services of his old coach in order to do so.

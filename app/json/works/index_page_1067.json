There is always the unseen presence of the large number of people surrounding you, most of them sleeping; the camera is awake in their dreamtime. The recording of these locations in the middle of the night rather than in daylight represents a transformation &#8212; like figure/ground reversal &#8212; of these physical spaces from the familiar thoughts and activities of the day to the night time shadows of emptiness and obscurity.&#8217;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:14:41:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["", "Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 2}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2628558, "name": "Bill Viola", "creator_id": 6438, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q437616", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2628561, "name": "TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen", "creator_id": 6411, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035506", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2628559, "name": "Kira Perov", "creator_id": 72741, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "assistant", "role_id": 450, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2628562, "name": "Artists' Television Workshop at WXXI/TV, Rochester", "creator_id": 6446, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357530", "role": "associate producer", "role_id": 930, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2628560, "name": "Kira Perov", "creator_id": 72741, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "photographer", "role_id": 440, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "126", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "released 1986", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [47455]}, {"id": 107961, "acmi_id": "B1000134", "title": "The Reflecting pool: collected work 1977-80", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-reflecting-pool-collected-work-1977-80", "creator_credit": "Bill Viola, Bruce Hutter, Mike Ballenger, Artists' Television Workshop at WXXI/TV, Rochester, Carol Brandenburg, Carvin Eison and TV Lab at WNET/Thirteen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "1977-1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Viola describes The Reflecting Pool as &#8216;a collection of five independent works which, taken as a whole, describe the stages of a personal journey using images of transition &#8212; from day to night, motion to stillness, time to timelessness, etc. Each work explores specific video techniques and technologies, in combination with the spatial potentials of stereo sound.&#8217; In the title work, all movement and change in an otherwise still scene is confined to the reflections on the surface of a pool in the woods.

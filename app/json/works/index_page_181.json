This comedy was Warren Beatty&#8217;s directorial debut and he has great fun as Pendleton/Farnsworth. A fairly light romantic comedy/fantasy, &#8220;Heaven can wait&#8221; is a remake of &#8220;Here comes Mr Jordan&#8221; (1941) and was a big hit in 1978. Winner of one Academy Award in 1979 for Best art direction, the film was nominated for seven others.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Croatian", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Slovenian", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture remakes", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Football - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Motion picture remakes", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/heaven-can-wait-1978", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962337, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962338, "name": "Warren Beatty", "creator_id": 22838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962339, "name": "Warren Beatty", "creator_id": 22838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962340, "name": "Buck Henry", "creator_id": 80283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962336, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51009", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [32947], "external_references": [{"id": 1745, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q637180"}, {"id": 4378, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "12185"}]}]}

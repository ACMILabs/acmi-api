This is the account of the &#8220;winners&#8221;, the Hymer family - parents Lyn and Michael, daughter Kirstie and her 2 sons - who moved from their Braemar Gardens home to the 1940&#8217;s house in West Wickham. &#8220;The Home front&#8221; (Dir: Simon Shaw): The Hymer&#8217;s move into Braemar Gardens and begin preparing themselves for the next 8 weeks. &#8220;1939-1940: Into the unknown&#8221; (Dir: Simon Shaw): the children become attached to the family rabbits intended for breeding, Lyn and Kirstie prepare an emergency food kit and learn about the intricacies of attending to their nightly toilette. Everyone pitches together to blackout the windows and construct an Anderson shelter. &#8220;1941-1943: Women at war&#8221; (Dir: Caroline Ross Pirie): Michael is sent away to work, leaving Lyn and Kirstie, like many women on the home front during the 40&#8217;s, left to look after family and home. They are also called upon to join the W.V.S (Women&#8217;s Voluntary Services), and find that the absence of Michael and their entry into the work force changes the family dynamics. Ben is assigned as fuel warden. This is a reality show with a difference. It features the usual tenets of direct camera address (minus the 24 hour intrusiveness), frustration at wanting to leave the &#8220;game&#8221;, plus a final episode in which the participants discuss their experience. There is ultimately no prize, other than the lessons they have learnt from their time in Braemar Gardens.

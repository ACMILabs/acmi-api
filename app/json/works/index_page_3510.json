She collaborated with her first husband, writer Henri Gauthier-Villars on the four novels of the Claudine series (1900-1903), using his pen name (Willy); they were largely her work. Writing under the name Colette, she established her reputation as the leading woman novelist of France. She was also a journalist, critic and playwright.

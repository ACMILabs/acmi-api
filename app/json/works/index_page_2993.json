Easy money: During the 1960s and 1970s casinos thrived in London, and none more so than the famous Playboy Club (1965-81) with its &#8220;bunny&#8221; girls. The many casinos attracted a second wave of high rollers from the oil rich Middle East and eventually a casino war broke out between Playboy and Ladbrokes over the custom of these wealthy Arab high rollers. Dirty tricks were played by both sides ending in both clubs losing their licenses.

By the early 1970s slot machines (pokies) took over from the table games in revenue and it is these very slot machines which built today&#8217;s Vegas.

The visualisation of this process was to<br />\nbe based on my childhood memories of a school activity.<br />\nThe initial concept was later widened to include 20 facts<br />\nabout the tree.<br />\nI was more interested in the processes used to establish<br />\nthe facts than the facts themselves. I wanted to explore my memories and visually represent the process as a memory. The processes I wanted to represent were tied to the following facts:<br />\n•The name of the tree<br />\n•The botanical name of the tree<br />\n•The distance from the tree<br />\n•The angle to the top of the tree<br />\n•The height equals distance multiplied by pi<br />\n•The height of the tree<br />\n•The width of the trunk<br />\n•The volume of the tree<br />\n•The age of the tree<br />\n•The colour of the bark in RGB<br />\n•The colour of the bark in hexadecimal<br />\n•The bark’s range and difference of colours<br />\n•The shape of the leaves<br />\n•The colour of the leaves<br />\n•The size of the leaves<br />\n•The area of the leaves<br />\n•The noise of the wind in the leaves of the tree<br />\n•The number of branches<br />\n•The location of the tree</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:20:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Student films - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature (Aesthetics)", "Experimental", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 731655, "name": "Dylan Davis", "creator_id": 10872, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 731656, "name": "Swinburne University of Technology", "creator_id": 8025, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production facilities", "role_id": 442, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD ROM; Back-up", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD ROM; Back-up", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-2 Digital File; Memory Grid Pod Full Encode", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12475", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [49488], "external_references": []}, {"id": 96748, "acmi_id": "504734", "title": "The tree of truth", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-tree-of-truth", "creator_credit": "Davidson Films and Encyclopaedia Britannica Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1975", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The story of a land with a magic tree that provides true or false answers to any problem posed.

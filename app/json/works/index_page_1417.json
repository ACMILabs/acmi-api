Born and raised in Toowoomba, Gina moved away from her family to settle in Sydney and further her musical career which began when she won the Star Maker award in 1991 (although she does have fond memories of busking at the local Mexican restaurant). Since then Gina has been awarded the Golden Guitar at Tamworth for Best Female Vocalist three years in a row. Gina relates memories of her rise to fame and footage is provided from the launch of her latest album, &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s daughter&#8221;. Full music clips are provided of &#8220;Dancin&#8217; with Elvis&#8221;, &#8220;Josephine&#8221; and &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got a heart&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Country music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music videos", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Women musicians", "People&nbsp;→ Jeffreys, Gina"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427535, "name": "Bernie Cannon", "creator_id": 29013, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427534, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427533, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43473", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [26565], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87073, "acmi_id": "308964", "title": "Endless harmony: the Beach Boys story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "endless-harmony-the-beach-boys-story", "creator_credit": "Alan Boyd, Stephanie Bennett and Brother Records", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This documentary traces the history of America&#8217;s most popular 60s band from their humble surf band beginnings at the end of the 50s, through to their 80s and 90s career as a nostalgia act.

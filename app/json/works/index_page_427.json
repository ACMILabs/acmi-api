Altman&#8217;s film performs the dazzling feat of finding a cinematic language to convey the rapture and terror of Van Gogh&#8217;s canvases.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and motion pictures", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Gauguin, Paul, 1848-1903", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Gogh, Theo van, 1857-1891", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Gogh, Vincent van, 1853-1890", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Impressionism (Art)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Syphilis", "People&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Gauguin, Paul, 1848-1903", "People&nbsp;→ Gogh, Theo van, 1857-1891", "People&nbsp;→ Gogh, Vincent van, 1853-1890"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958745, "name": "Belbo Films", "creator_id": 31839, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958746, "name": "Central Films", "creator_id": 17205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958747, "name": "Arena Films", "creator_id": 28606, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958748, "name": "Ludi Boeken", "creator_id": 79269, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958749, "name": "David Conroy", "creator_id": 24765, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958750, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55163", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

An autopsy reveals a few unexpected clues relating to Laura&#8217;s actions on the night of her murder. Meanwhile, the first suspect, Laura&#8217;s secret lover James Hurley, is released from custody, while several other people are questioned regarding their relations with Laura. EPISODE TWO: Agent Cooper turns to unconventional criminology methods, lecturing the local Sheriff&#8217;s office on the wisdom of Tibet. Several important plot threads are also revealed in this episode, while a new and uneasy friendship forms between the sultry and spoilt Audrey Horne and Laura&#8217;s best friend, Donna Hayward. This episode, directed by Lynch himself, ends with the much discussed surreal dream sequence where Agent Cooper encounters strange figures such as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man from Another Place and Laura Palmer herself.

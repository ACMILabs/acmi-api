KGB spying began in Los Alamos where scientists worked in secrecy to develop America&#8217;s first atomic bomb and by the 1940s they had successfully infiltrated the heart of Western intelligence. The CIA counter attacked with their own espionage operations. Between the 1940s-1960s, there was intelligence and counterintelligence, spies and double spies, names such as Philby, Burgess and Maclean, but gradually human spies would be replaced by technology by means of photography and electronic eavesdropping. Satellites would be able to intercept radio communications and the Soviets began to fear they were losing ground to American technology. The 1980s represented a time of change in the Cold War and particularly in the disarmament of nuclear weapons, with Ronald Reagan as the US President and Mikhail Gorbachev as leader of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev introduced &#8220;perestroika&#8221; (restructuring) and &#8220;glasnost&#8221; (openness) and in 1985, the two leaders met in Geneva for the first superpower summit in six years. In 1986, the Chernobyl disaster rocked the Soviet Union and six months later, Gorbachev and Reagan agreed to the complete withdrawal of intermediate range missiles in Europe and a 50% reduction in ballistic missiles over a five year period. However, during all of this negotiating, Reagan persisted with his &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theory, or Strategic Defense Initiative through to the end of his presidency in 1989. Gorbachev&#8217;s perestroika began filtering through the Soviet bloc, including Hungary and Poland, but the most dramatic moment came when in 1989 the Berlin Wall came down, opening up East and West Berlin. However this epic event also signalled the crumbling of the Kremlin and its control over Eastern Europe as well as leading to the demise of Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist Party and the end of the USSR and the rise of Boris Yeltsin and the newly created Commonwealth of Independent States. Bush, on Christmas Day, 1991, announced to the world that the Cold War confrontation between the two superpowers was now over. Narrated by Kenneth Branagh.

The division between East and West Berlin gradually widened as Khrushchev pushed for total control of Berlin. In September 1959 he became the first Soviet leader to visit the United States where he met with President Eisenhower. However with the shooting down of a US spy plane in Soviet air space, relations between the two super powers became decidedly icy. Thousands of East Berliners flowed into West Berlin and in an effort to stem the flow, East German and Soviet troops, on the morning of 13 August 1961, sealed the East German border with barricades which eventually became the Wall, the supreme symbol of the Cold War&#8217;s cruelty and Europe&#8217;s division. Meanwhile in 1959 a revolution was taking place in Cuba lead by the charasmatic Fidel Castro. Cuban land and industry had been almost totally controlled by American corporations but under Castro&#8217;s rule, nationalisation became the agenda. John F. Kennedy became President of the United States in January 1961 and immediately found himself embroiled in a CIA plot to overthrow Castro and subsequently the famous Bay of Pigs invasion which almost brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster as Khrushchev (supporting Castro) and JFK played out a deadly game of power. Also featured in this volume is the history of the Vietnam Conflict from its beginning in 1954 in Dien Bien Phu when the French, backed by the United States lost control of their Vietnamese colony and were defeated by the Communist lead army of General Giap. And finally the 1960s and the arms race between the super powers where the world&#8217;s safety relied on a nuclear paradox known as &#8220;Mutually Assured Destruction&#8221; or &#8220;MAD&#8221; where if either side initiated nuclear warfare, the other side would respond with sufficient power to inflict unacceptable damage. With Vietnam and the Six Day War in the Middle East, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States almost reached bursting point finally leading to negotiations in 1969 known as SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks).

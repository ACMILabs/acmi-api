However, his privileged life begins to crumble around him when three of his surgically-enhanced patients die under mysterious circumstances, thrusting him into the spotlight as the number one suspect. Determined to clear his name and prevent the possible death of a forth patient, Cindy (Susan Dey), he begins his own investigation into the murders, discovering links between the dead models and a sinister research facility known as Digital Matrix. Infiltrating the complex, he uncovers an experimental advertising project where computer-animated images employ an auto-hypnotic suggestible trance to manipulate audiences into purchasing products. The situation turns nasty when Cindy is taken hostage, and Dr. Roberts becomes trapped in a race against time to save her from suffering a similar fate to the other victims.

Lily Bart (in an exquisite performance by &#8220;X-Files&#8221; star Gillian Anderson) is an intelligent, unconventional woman in her late 20s, torn between a constraining, rigid society and her own individuality. In order to remain a member of New York&#8217;s elite social circle, Lily realises she must marry a wealthy, respectable man. But finding someone who will nourish her intellect, appreciate her unconventionality and provide the funds is painstakingly difficult. The film&#8217;s most powerful scenes are those between Lily and the man she is evidently most attracted to, Lawrence Selden, who ironically is not wealthy enough to make him a suitable husband. With no job and dependent on her rich maiden aunt for a daily allowance, from whom she hopes to receive an inheritance, Lily mistakenly asks Gus Trenor for some assistance. This act of borrowing only leads to further complications, involving the cunning Mr. Rosedale, that entangle Lily and limit her options. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; charts Lily&#8217;s progressive defeat and the suffering she endures as she loses her name and, concomitantly, social respect. Alone and ostracised, Lily&#8217;s finale is a monumental passage in the film. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; is a tragic tale about a woman who tries desperately to both be true to her heart and play by society&#8217;s rules. But she can&#8217;t have both and ultimately ends up with nothing at all. New York upper class society is a character unto itself throughout his film - a conservative and rigid set of attitudes, sentiments, and values that have the power to do terrible evil. Stars Gillian Anderson, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia, Eric Stoltz, Eleanor Bron, Laura Linney.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The House of mirth [DVD]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Terence Davies, Three Rivers and Olivia Stewart</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 2000</p>", "description": "<p>A detailed, passionate adaptation of Edith Wharton&#8217;s 1905 novel, &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; is Terence Davies&#8217; finest film to date.

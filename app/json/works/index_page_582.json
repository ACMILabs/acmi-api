Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film captures family holidays at Port Stephens, Point Roadknight and Ocean Grove, Victoria and Christmas in 1978. The family also goes fishing, plays tennis at the Geelong Lawn Tennis Club, attends a family wedding and enjoys some snow in Geelong.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Karen playing

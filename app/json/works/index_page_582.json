Plotlines centre on the daily challenges faced by the highly strung, over-ambitious staff closest to the president - the press secretary, chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, and deputy communications director - who carry on most of their frenetically paced, but always articulate, conversations while striding purposefully through the corridors and offices of the West Wing.

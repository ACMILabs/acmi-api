After signing with Capitol Records in 1968, they recorded eight U.S. Top 40 albums, including three million sellers. Out of all of the group&#8217;s albums, their eponymously titled 1969 album achieved Billboard success, was their second million seller, and is now regarded as a rock classic because of its careful blending of black, country, rockabilly and rock and roll music. The story of The Band and their classic album is recounted here in words, images and music, with contributions by rock legends Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Bernie Taupin and Don Was.

The highly vocal, quirky, 30-year-old Mark lives at home with his parents in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, getting by on a few odd jobs like newspaper delivery and shovelling snow whilst his 3 kids live with his ex-wife. Mark&#8217;s big dream, however, is to be an American filmmaker. A horror film buff, he has been making no-budget gore flicks on 8mm since an early age, all of which starred his friends and some of which include sequels that run up to the fourth instalment.

The gap between Mark&#8217;s suburban reality and his dream is all too obvious, and the filmmakers milk a lot of laughs from his &#8216;loser&#8217; existence: his drugged out friend, Mike; his relationship with Uncle Bill, a senile old man from whom he derives financing; his home life; his eccentric personality; the &#8216;nobodies&#8217; who help him on his film and so on. But the documentary also shows a great deal of compassion for Mark and recognition of both his earnestness to make films and the many hurdles and obstacles this dream involves.

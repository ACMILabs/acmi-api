By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This reel opens with the title &#8216;Surfers Paradise May 1975&#8217; written in the sand between waves. The subtitle &#8216;Passing Parade&#8217; shows the filmmakers intention: life on the beach on the Gold Coast at the time. The reel begins with early morning scenes of both the beach and the duplex holiday house situated right on the sand. We see lots of surfing – board surfing, body surfing and a longboard with paddles. We also see a large jellyfish in the sand, frisbee playing, strolling along the sand in 1970s fashion flares, Gadsdens running in a group along the beach, family members fishing, a commercial fishing boat in the waves, knitting on a towel on sand, sitting on the house balcony with drinks, a barbeque on the rooftop and views along the coastline.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:01:56:00 ice cream cart on the beach<br />\n00:13:14:00 the filmmaker himself enjoying a XXXX beer while smiling for the camera<br />\n00:13:53:00

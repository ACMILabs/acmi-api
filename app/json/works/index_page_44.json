Ulee takes refuge from this state of affairs in the production of his high-grade honey with the unspoken assistance of his youngest granddaughter. However, when Jimmy&#8217;s partners begin threatening his family, thinking that Jimmy has hidden the proceeds of their robbery, Ulee&#8217;s stubbornly suppressed sense of the unconditional bond and care that links his family begins to surface and he becomes involved in the tenuous situation. Nunez handles this film with a simplicity and sensitivity that effectively evokes the personal journey of Ulee and the rest of his family in challenging circumstances.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Bees", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/ulees-gold", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956639, "name": "Orion Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 9553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956640, "name": "Clinica Estetico", "creator_id": 72205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956641, "name": "Victor Nunez", "creator_id": 78668, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956638, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44389", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [27320], "external_references": [{"id": 2567, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2060364"}, {"id": 6517, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "55306"}]}, {"id": 88907, "acmi_id": "311529", "title": "Ugly, dirty and bad = Brutti, sporchi e cattivi", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ugly-dirty-and-bad-brutti-sporchi-e-cattivi", "creator_credit": "Compagnia Cinematografica Champion, Carlo Ponti and Ettore Scola", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Director Ettore Scola focuses on a large dysfunctional family living in a shanty town on the outskirts of Rome.

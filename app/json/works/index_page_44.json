The films playful lack of respect for historical figures and its fairly decent musical numbers are some of its many pleasures. (Not to mention singing sphincters and a drag queen HIV virus!) Set in present day Toronto, Zero Patience has famous sexologist and explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton (John Robinson), still alive due to his discovery of the fountain of youth and working as chief taxidermist for the Natural History Museum.

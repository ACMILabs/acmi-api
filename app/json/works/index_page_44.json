Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is still in therapy and though he is still baiting psychoanalyst Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), he is getting closer to understanding the source of his anxiety attacks: they are triggered by memories of his violent childhood. But with the death of his mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), Tony has to deal with the twin demons of rage and guilt. Tony also has to deal with his daughter Meadow&#8217;s awakening sexuality (including her falling in love with a black man) as well as with the spiritual angst of his wife, Carmella (Edie Falco), who is increasingly disturbed by the ethical implications of her being a partner to a mobster. It&#8217;s only when he meets the beautiful Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) that things start looking up for Tony, but soon, in true Soprano&#8217;s style, her emotional instability creates a dangerous domestic situation for him. Outstanding episodes in this series include &#8220;Employee of the month&#8221;, which deals with the rape of Dr. Melfi, the black comedy of &#8220;Pine barrens&#8221;, directed by Steve Buscemi, and the horrifying violence of &#8220;University&#8221; which features the abusive relationship between a mobster and one of the strippers at the Bada Bing.

In its moral complexity, insight and daring it leaves the products of the Hollywood motion picture industry for dead.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["13:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Emmy Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in television", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Depression, Mental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3086452, "name": "Alan Taylor", "creator_id": 80741, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1113146", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086450, "name": "Allen Coulter", "creator_id": 80740, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q423052", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086458, "name": "Andy Wolk", "creator_id": 80744, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4761509", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086444, "name": "Daniel Attias", "creator_id": 80738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086442, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381982", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086448, "name": "John Patterson", "creator_id": 75124, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1794153", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086454, "name": "Lorraine Senna", "creator_id": 80742, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1870399", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086459, "name": "Matthew Penn", "creator_id": 80745, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6791068", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086446, "name": "Nick Gomez", "creator_id": 80739, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3339752", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086456, "name": "Tim Van Patten", "creator_id": 80743, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q713066", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086440, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q381982", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086438, "name": "Ilene Landress", "creator_id": 36246, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086435, "name": "Brillstein-Grey Entertainment", "creator_id": 36244, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086436, "name": "Chase Films", "creator_id": 36245, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3086433, "name": "Home Box Office", "creator_id": 22860, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 3086431, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

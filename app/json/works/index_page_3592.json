This work traces his life story from Kansas City to the New York jazz scene of the 1950s, tracing the short, somewhat tragic journey of a lauded and revered, if commercially ignored, musician. As well as providing key performances of signature tunes - Ballade, Yardbird Suite, Just friends, Koko, Confirmation, Au Privave and Kim Bloomdido - this work also comprises his only surviving TV performance, and interviews with Bird&#8217;s contemporaries. Contains wonderful vintage footage of Bird performing, plus tunes performed by Thelonious Monk, Louis Armstrong and Count Basie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Race discrimination", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Improvisation (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930292, "name": "Toby Byron", "creator_id": 23415, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930293, "name": "Multiprises", "creator_id": 23416, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930294, "name": "Sony Video Software Company", "creator_id": 37286, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930295, "name": "Pioneer Artists", "creator_id": 37287, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930291, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53174", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [34618]}]}

Glamorgan is the Toorak campus of the Geelong Grammar School in Geelong Victoria. The boys wear Geelong Grammar school caps. Behind the cricket pitch we can see the rooftops and chimneys of the grand homes of Toorak. There is a colourfully painted wall behind the cricketers depicting a scene of Governor Phillip raising the flag at Sydney Cove in 1788. A hand painted didactic says:<br />\n“Governor Phillip brought the First Fleet to anchor at Botany Bay but raised the flag at Sydney Cove January 26th 1788. This was the first Australia Day.”</p>\n<p>We see the Glamorgan Vs Visitors scoreboard, runs being made, catches being taken and 4s being scored.</p>\n<p>The film then takes us to a suburban backyard to show a young baby on a rug.

Here, young Orgyen and fellow monks are taken with the excitement of the cup final approaching, their only dilemma is how are they going to be able to watch the final without a TV. &#8216;The Cup&#8217; is a delightful comedy that looks at how a group of novice monks can come up with money to rent a TV and seek the permission of their leader, Geko, who is firm handed, and Khempo, the older and slightly more easy going leader. Written and directed by Khyentse Norbu who was himself a Buddhist monk, this is the first film to be released in the Tibetan language.

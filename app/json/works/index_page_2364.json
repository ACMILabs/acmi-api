Much of &#8220;Gaza Strip&#8221; unfolds through gripping and powerful images without the use of lengthy interviews or a political dialogue, but rather startling audiovisual bites of the daily struggle within Gaza. Perhaps the most moving and disturbing moment in &#8220;Gaza&#8221; is the admission of an infant child contemplating the life of a martyr. &#8220;Gaza Strip&#8221; is Longley&#8217;s first feature.

The story also follows the romancing of Mary Jane as she finds her feet in Manhattan and dates Parker&#8217;s best friend and roommate Harry Osborne. Raimi achieves impact with this film on an emotional level that has been sorely lacking from so many comic book adaptations. He does this by imparting Parker with problems that an audience can relate to - thwarted love, disappointment, guilt and grief - woes that Spider-man&#8217;s phenomenal strengths cannot combat. Maguire imbues the title role with sensitivity and gravitas, whilst character actor Willem Dafoe ably plays a dual role of Norman Osborn, and Parker&#8217;s arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Hindi"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Closed captioning", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Cartoon characters", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2308001, "name": "Sam Raimi", "creator_id": 5352, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q275402", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308000, "name": "Ian Bryce", "creator_id": 72288, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q536964", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2307998, "name": "Laura Ziskin", "creator_id": 79070, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q270533", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2307996, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2307997, "name": "Marvel Entertainment", "creator_id": 71321, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2307990, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52337", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33927]}, {"id": 94420, "acmi_id": "318270", "title": "Dogtown and Z-boys", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dogtown-and-z-boys-dvd", "creator_credit": "Stacy Peralta, Agi Orsi, AOP and Vans Off The Wall", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45422, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q623615"}], "brief_description": "<p>1975 and in a slum area of Santa Monica, California, was located a rough neighbourhood know as Dogtown.

Carole is offered the opportunity to be part of a work study program with the local vet, and is thrilled. Not only is being a vet her dream, but she can work with cute animals all day. Things don&#8217;t turn out as well as she plans and her confidence in her abilities drops. When spoilt rich-girl Veronica di Angelo&#8217;s negligence results in her horse Cobalt being put down, Carole is devastated and quits riding completely. Lisa and Stevie must work together to change their friend&#8217;s mind. They&#8217;ve already lost Cobalt, they don&#8217;t want to lose Carole too.

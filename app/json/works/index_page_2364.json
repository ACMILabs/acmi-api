Set in 1980, the film explores a post-industrial world in which capitalism has seemingly no more need for the labourers and workers which it previously employed to generate wealth. As the butcher walks the graffiti strewn desolate streets of northern Paris, passing shut down factories and warehouses, he is continually giving vent to destructive homophobic, misogynist and racist fantasies, blaming everyone except himself for the alienation and menial servitude of his life.

By the end of the film, as the butcher degenerates into complete solipsism and lunacy, he articulates a value system for this new age based on idolisation of rape, incest and murder. The film is as a passionate, ambiguous and disturbing exploration of the attraction of neo-fascism for the French indigenous working class. In French with English subtitles.

The stunning black and white cinematography gives the Caribbean island a magical hue and aura. But this is far from a travelogue or a mere celebration of an &#8220;exotic&#8221; locale. The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas. Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema. From the opening sequence where the camera flies across the island, to a stunning tracking shot of a man navigating his canoe through a village perched on water, to the final rousing march of the revolutionaries descending from the hills, the film is an intoxicating series of marvellous choreographed set pieces. Though Mikhail&#8217;s influences are clearly those of silent cinema, the score and soundtrack to &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is also equally powerful, experimental and emotionally rich. The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA).

Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema.

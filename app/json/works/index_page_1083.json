Based on Pierre Boulle&#8217;s best seller and starring Alec Guinness, William Holden and Jack Hawkins, this is the gripping tale of British POWs, captured by the Japanese in World War II and ordered to build a bridge to accommodate the Burma-Siam Railway. Honoured with 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director, this film continues to be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences. The bridge demolition scene remains a brilliant piece of stunt photography.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Burma-Siam Railway", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Burma-Siam Railway", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ French literature - Film and video adaptations", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959784, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959785, "name": "Horizon (US)", "creator_id": 24908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959786, "name": "Horizon (GB)", "creator_id": 17277, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959787, "name": "Sam Spiegel", "creator_id": 22582, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959788, "name": "David Lean", "creator_id": 17039, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55260", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 959783, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48591", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [30737], "external_references": [{"id": 5698, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "826"}]}, {"id": 87245, "acmi_id": "309170", "title": "The Bridge", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-bridge", "creator_credit": "Victorian College of the Arts, School of Film and Television and Jo Kennedy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Danny Craven lives in Launching Place, a quiet town that is relatively isolated from the rest of the community.

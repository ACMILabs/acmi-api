But when her seemingly endless stream of promotions demand more and more of her time, Ding is confronted with a torrent of confusing feelings. Ding goes to visit Zhou, whose father is also a &#8220;housewife.&#8221; Ding tests her to see what he can get out of the relationship: He refuses to do housework, and wants her to pull strings and grant him favours. But she won&#8217;t budge. She has no time for him, and he supposedly needs to work hard to please her. He gets angry, they quarrel, and he leaves.<br />\nBy the time Miss Zhou has been made Bureau Head of the district&#8217;s post office, the once confident and cool Ding Dasen has degenertated into a whining sulky ball of frustration who preoccupies himself with formulating new schemes to make Zhou Qin jealous, or to find quick fixes to make himself more successful than her. As a result, he is easily taken in by the conman Cui Hailong, CEO of the &#8220;Space Exploitation Company&#8221; to launder money for him. When Cui is not conducting official business entertaining potential investors, he is boiling leather in the back room to sell as medicine.

They both think Zhou has too many responsibilities and no time to take care of the household. Here we can also see how Ding&#8217;s upbringing according to these strict gender roles has left him totally incapable of taking care of himself. Mum meets butcher girl who is the complete opposite to Zhou. Ding&#8217;s mum wants to introduce the local butcher to Ding as a more practical alternative life partner. In a more traditional setup the two mums introduce the two and leave them to hit it off.

Zhou explains to her why she is always so busy; that she is vested with the heavy responsibilities of mediating not only working practice, but also worker relations: Health, marriage, deaths and quarrels all fall under her jurisdiction.

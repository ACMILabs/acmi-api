In this film, Renoir perhaps came closest to the dark mood of fatalistic &#8216;poetic realism&#8217; that characterised the works of Carne and Duvivier in the 1930s. In August 1939, on the eve of WWII, the French Ministry of Information drew up a list of 51 &#8216;depressing, morbid, immoral and bad for the youths&#8217; films, including &#8216;La Bete Humaine&#8217;. Re-made in the USA by Fritz Lang as &#8216;Human Desire&#8217; (1954) with Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, Edgar Buchanan.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Robert and Raymond Hakim ; director, writer, Jean Renoir ; photography, Curt Courant, Claude Renoir ; music, Joseph Kosma ; art direction, Eugene Lourie ; editor, Marguerite Renoir ; stills photographer, Sam Levin.<br />\nCast: Credits: Jean Gabin, Simone Simon, Fernand Ledoux, Blanchette Brunoy, Julien Carette.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 891176, "name": "Jean Renoir", "creator_id": 17563, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 891175, "name": "Raymond Hakim", "creator_id": 12956, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 891174, "name": "Robert Hakim", "creator_id": 12955, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "147060", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [55820]}, {"id": 115936, "acmi_id": "X000097", "title": "La Belle Equipe = They Were Five", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-belle-equipe-they-were-five", "creator_credit": "Julien Duvivier and Arys Nissotti", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1936", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>The fortune of five unemployed labourers take a radical turn for the better when they jointly win a 100,000 francs lottery prize.

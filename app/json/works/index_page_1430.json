One moment moving us with highly emotional scenes of alienation and loss, the director Roy Andersson then juxtaposes those moments with scenes of wicked and almost blasphemous black humour (an old Army General celebrating his centenary embarrasses the guests by calling out for Goering; a fast-talking businessman throws away crucifixes in disgust when he realises Christianity no longer sells).

In this world of mirrors and endless windows reflecting and opening up to only increasing folly, the fire and brimstone of the Christian Armageddon is replaced by the insane selfishness, greed and panic which greets the capitalist vision of the end of the world.

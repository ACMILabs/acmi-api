The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.</p>\n<p>The sound of the instrument is often associated with eerie situations. Thus, the theremin has been used in movie soundtracks such as Miklós Rózsa&#8217;s Spellbound and The Lost Weekend, Bernard Herrmann&#8217;s The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Justin Hurwitz&#8217;s First Man, as well as in theme songs for television shows such as the ITV drama Midsomer Murders. The theremin is also used in concert music (especially avant-garde and 20th- and 21st-century new music), and in popular music genres such as rock.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin", "title": "en.wikipedia.org", "source": "vernon"}], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": null, "source_identifier": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [{"date": "1920", "notes": "", "to_year": "1920"}], "labels": [1249]}, {"id": 73662, "acmi_id": "010767", "title": "Theory of management development", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "theory-of-management-development", "creator_credit": "Department of Visual Communication, UCLA", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1961", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1961-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Dr. Charles Ferguson presents a lecture about the nature of a manager, discussing some of the assumptions upon which management development theory is based, and the importance of a manager&#8217;s self knowledge and awareness of the multiple roles he or she performs as a supervisor, a peer, and a subordinate.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Theory of management development</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Department of Visual Communication, UCLA</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1961</p>", "description": "<p>Dr. Charles Ferguson presents a lecture about the nature of a manager, discussing some of the assumptions upon which management development theory is based, and the importance of a manager&#8217;s self knowledge and awareness of the multiple roles he or she performs as a supervisor, a peer, and a subordinate.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Dr. Charles Ferguson presents a lecture about the nature of a manager, discussing some of the assumptions upon which management development theory is based, and the importance of a manager&#8217;s self knowledge and awareness of the multiple roles he or she performs as a supervisor, a peer, and a subordinate.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:29:58:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Management", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Personnel management", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Management - Study and teaching", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Psychology - Study and teaching", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology - Study and teaching", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 859476, "name": "Department of Visual Communication, UCLA", "creator_id": 18299, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

Her final scene is unforgettable.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952580, "name": "Billy Wilder", "creator_id": 56081, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952579, "name": "Charles Brackett", "creator_id": 23438, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952578, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952585, "name": "Buster Keaton", "creator_id": 831, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 952584, "name": "Cecil B.

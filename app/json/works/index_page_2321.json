The five don&#8217;t know, like or particularly trust one another but must work together to get the job done. Director Frankenheimer, somewhat of an expert in the field of car chase sequences, flexes his knowledge here with spectacular rides through the narrow streets of Paris and Cannes. Pyrotechnics, rolling cars, shootouts and a minor love interest make &#8220;Ronin&#8221; a fairly standard crime movie with some very impressive stunts. International cast includes: Robert De Niro, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Jonathon Pryce and Jean Reno.

At times genuinely terrifying, this film is somewhat dated, particularly in the special effects department, but interestingly was released just a year before Spielberg&#8217;s hugely successful &#8220;Poltergeist&#8221;, with which it shares many major themes. Hershey puts in a fine performance as an imperilled woman whose ordinary (if bleak) life is put under siege by forces beyond her comprehension. Although the film takes a somewhat dissatisfying turn mid-way through, it remains an interesting example of a science versus spirit movie and should prove a boon to horror buffs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hallucinations and illusions", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hysteria (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology - Research", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Demoniac possession", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientists"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-entity", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2346857, "name": "Sidney J.

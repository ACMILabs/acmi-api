The story begins with the Viking invasion in 793 AD on the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne where the complex web of Celtic Churches were savagely attacked and destroyed. This invasion, occupation and settlement, continued on through the years to 1066 and the Battle of Hastings when William, Duke of Normandy, defeated Harold II, and took the English throne heralding the beginning of a mass takeover by the Normans. Over time, the Celtic culture was almost absorbed and reality and truth lost its way as in the legend of King Arthur - the myth lives on even today. The continual assault on the Celtic communities by the English led to turmoil and revolt during the 1300s, with Scotland seemingly the only one to retain its independence through the emergence of William Wallace and then Robert Bruce. By 1532 AD, Brittany was defeated and absorbed into France, and in 1536 Wales became part of England.

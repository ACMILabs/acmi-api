(Awards: Grand Prize for Film Animation, Oberhausen Festival)</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A bitter, pessimistic cartoon, showing man&#8217;s utter helplessness in the face of forces stronger than himself. A man&#8217;s home is invaded by the letter &#8220;A&#8221;. Guile, flattery, magic, brute strength fail to remove this enemy. He gives up all hope - then discovers that &#8220;A&#8221; has disappeared. After a period of doubt he is delighted to be alone again. Suddenly &#8220;B&#8221; appears! In fine line pen-and-ink style reminiscent of 19th century engraving, Jan Lenica has created a visual joke based on one of Eugene Ionesco&#8217;s quotations. The letters also symbolise privacy, oppression or one&#8217;s own problems.

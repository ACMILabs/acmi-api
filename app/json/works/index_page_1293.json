Two days later see this same mad passionate crowd contained in the Azadi Grand Stadium to welcome home their heroes - united and jubilant these fans are one. In Farsi with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A compilation of three short Iranian films all shot in Tehran and each purveying through its images, streetscapes of life and human behaviour at chosen moments in time. Independent and individual as each of these three films are, they also provide a juxtaposition to one another and an engaging focus on human interaction and reaction. &#8220;Deadtime&#8221; - An amusing look at what people do when they are stuck in congested city traffic with the traffic lights jammed on red. Close-up images of patient drivers, restless children, bored passengers and the various activities which take place to fill in the ticking minutes that appear to be turning into never-ending hours. No dialogue but contains street sounds and background music. &#8220;The White station&#8221; - In total contrast with &#8220;Deadtime&#8221;, this film presents a stark and isolated situation caused through a severe snow storm where a few brave and lonely souls are waiting for the arrival of the Tehran public transport system to pick them up. Evocative filming with just the sound of the wind and snow, interspersed with the occasional bird-life, simplistic and intriguing. No dialogue. &#8220;Tehran: the 25th hour&#8221; - On 29 November 1998 the return match of Iran and Australia for the World Cup 1998 was televised in Tehran live from Melbourne. Iran qualified and the quiet urban streets of Tehran soon transformed into mad scenes of jubilation and celebration, people everywhere of all ages joining in cheering and dancing, lining the streets on foot and in their cars. Two days later see this same mad passionate crowd contained in the Azadi Grand Stadium to welcome home their heroes - united and jubilant these fans are one.

Wahlberg&#8217;s chaotic domestic life and stressful blood soaked professional life come unstuck when the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman&#8217;s daughter has major repercussions for the band of killers. From its fetishistic reconstruction of the code and conduct of organized crime, right down to its casual, flippant depictions of violence, &#8220;The Big hit&#8221; owes a lot to the films of Quentin Tarantino (which are in themselves pastiches of various European and American filmmakers). However the spectre of the Hong Kong action film hangs over them all (&#8220;The Big hit&#8221; goes as far as enlisting Hong Kong action director Che-Kirk Wong and the executive producer is the legendary John Woo), a cinema that is wonderfully inventive with its own form of genre splicing and indirect homage. Cast also includes Christina Applegate, Elliot Gould, Laine Kazan and Avery Brooks.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963509, "name": "Tri-Star Pictures", "creator_id": 22768, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963510, "name": "Warren Zide", "creator_id": 80627, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963511, "name": "Wesley Snipes", "creator_id": 59635, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963512, "name": "Che-Kirk Wong", "creator_id": 80653, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963508, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51981", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33618]}, {"id": 65406, "acmi_id": "320184", "title": "The Big gull: Karoro: New Zealand's black-backed gull", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-big-gull-karoro-new-zealands-black-backed-gull", "creator_credit": "New Zealand National Film Unit, Derek Wright and Grant Foster", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "New Zealand, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The New Zealand black-backed gull is one of 44 species that has adapted its natural way of life, to benefit from the wasteful habits of man.

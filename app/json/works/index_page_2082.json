It focuses on the friendship between two &#8216;battlers&#8217;, Dancy, an orphan who has spent most of her life on the streets and Snow, a taciturn man on the rebound from a failed marriage. Forced to travel the country in search of work, like many working-class Australians of the time, and surviving mainly on dole book rations, their lives are full of hardship and deprivation, but the comradeship they develop on the road also brings them many moments of comfort and happiness. Cast includes Audine Lieth, Marcus Graham, Anne Phelan, Gary Sweet and Jacqueline McKenzie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Poverty - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Unemployment - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "History&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "History&nbsp;→ Poverty - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Unemployment - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Mini-series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2330041, "name": "George Ogilvie", "creator_id": 20795, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3101803", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2330038, "name": "Gus Howard", "creator_id": 75853, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223413", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2330036, "name": "South Australian Film Corporation", "creator_id": 53697, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7566109", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2330033, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47821", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [30065]}, {"id": 90567, "acmi_id": "313539", "title": "Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shiloh-2-shiloh-season", "creator_credit": "Sandy Tung, Carl Borack, Dale Rosenbloom and Utopia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46382, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4375931"}], "brief_description": "<p>Marty Preston (Zachary Browne) is a well-meaning 12-year-old who adopts Shiloh, a beagle who was treated cruelly by his first master, a bitter alcoholic named Judd (Scott Wilson).

Newly married, Emmanuelle flys to Bangkok to join her husband, Jean, but soon succumbs to the boredom of her circumstances. When Jean encourages her to actively seek out new sexual adventures with men and women, she is momentarily taken aback. However, after being pursued by the nymphette, Marie-Ange, and seduced by her friend, Ariane, after a game of squash, Emmanuelle decides to seek out Bee (Marika Green), an archaeologist working in Bangkok, for friendship and fun. The consequences of this encounter convince her to meet with the elderly Mario (Alain Cuny), who offers to further her sexual education, promising her that he will free her from a life of moral slavery. Under his expert tuition, Emmanuelle is finally able to throw off the last vestiges of guilt, and abandon herself to the pleasures of free, unbounded sex. Advertised as &#8220;X was never like this!&#8221;, the film was a smash hit around the world. &#8220;Emmanuelle&#8221;, the first feature film by Dutch director, Just Jaekin, is the highest grossing French film of all-time, spawning six official sequels, numerous &#8220;copycat&#8221; sequels, and a French TV show.

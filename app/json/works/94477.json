Romantic, melodramatic, evil and mystical, this German folkloric tale set in the Bohemian forest tells of a rivalry between Max (Toni Kramer) and Kaspar (Wolfgang Probst) over the hand of the beautiful young Agathe (Catarina Ligendza), daughter of Kuno (Fritz Linke) the head Ranger to Prince Ottokar.

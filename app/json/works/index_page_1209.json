Following their various schemes and robberies, &#8220;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#8221; is both a Western comedy and a &#8216;buddy&#8217; movie. Redford and Newman play the bandits of the title with charm and style, sparring with one another, whilst cooking up adventurous plans. Joining them in their tomfoolery is Sundance&#8217;s girlfriend Etta Place (Katherine Ross), a schoolteacher, with a soft spot for both men. &#8220;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#8221; is a revisionist Western which toys with the convention of the bandit who outsmarts the law with stealth, in this case accidents of fate being a major factor in Butch and Sundance&#8217;s success. The film pitches Butch and Sundance, with their values firmly defined by the code of the Old West, against the ways of a new modern order. William Goldman won an Academy Award for best original screenplay.

This violent film, typical of Peckinpah, relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnapping, bribery, extortion and general mayhem. No-one in this film is honourable or attractive, and yet the viewer finds themself actually hoping that McQueen and MacGraw, thieves though they are, will get away. Cast includes: Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Sally Struthers, Al Lettieri and Slim Pickens.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Extortion", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-getaway-1972", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1969717, "name": "Sam Peckinpah", "creator_id": 26583, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51461", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1969716, "name": "Mitchell Brower", "creator_id": 78673, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1969715, "name": "David Foster", "creator_id": 70796, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1969714, "name": "First Artists", "creator_id": 29870, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1969713, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44427", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [27324], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87833, "acmi_id": "309922", "title": "Barcelona [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "barcelona-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Whit Stillman and New Visions Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An off-beat and ironic talk-fest from director Whit Stillman, this is a dry, insightful comedy about two American cousins in post-Franco Spain.

Recently widowed and working mother of two teenage children, Iris (Jane Fonda) is struggling, both financially and emotionally. Stanley (Robert DeNiro) lives alone with his elderly father and is unable to read or write, a problem he has lived with for his entire life. The two meet when Stanley comes to the aid of Iris after her handbag is stolen, soon discovering that they are co-workers from the same local commercial bakery. And so begins a friendship.

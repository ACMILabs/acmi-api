The flight recorder is being held aboard Sevastopol, a remote space station owned by the Seegson corporation, in orbit around the KG-348 gas giant. Samuels offers Ripley a place on the Weyland-Yutani team being sent to retrieve it so that she can have closure regarding the fate of her missing mother. Ripley, Samuels, and Weyland-Yutani executive Nina Taylor travel to Sevastopol on board the Torrens courier ship.

They attempt to spacewalk over to the station to investigate, but their EVA line is severed by debris, and Ripley is separated from the others and forced to enter the station on her own. </p>\n<p>While exploring Sevastopol, Ripley finds the flight recorder of the Nostromo with no data and learns that the station is out of control due to a deadly alien creature lurking aboard. After regrouping with Samuels and Taylor, Ripley meets the station&#8217;s Marshal, Waits, and his deputy, Ricardo. Waits explains that the alien was brought onto the station by Anesidora captain Henry Marlow, whose crew discovered the flight recorder near the LV-426 moon, where they also found a derelict ship previously found by the Nostromo crew and a nest of alien eggs contained within. While exploring the derelict, Marlow&#8217;s wife was attacked by a facehugger. She was then brought aboard Sevastopol for emergency medical treatment, but died after a chestburster hatched from her. Waits convinces Ripley to contain the alien inside a remote module of the station. Although Ripley is successful, Waits ejects the module from the station with her still inside.

After making her way outside to help the Torrens detach from the station, Ripley is surrounded by alien creatures and ultimately thrown into the ship by a blast. Aboard the Torrens, Ripley discovers that another alien has boarded the ship. When Ripley is cornered in the airlock, she ejects herself and the alien into space. Adrift in her space suit, Ripley is awakened by a searchlight.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Formats/platforms", "display_values": ["PC (Microsoft Windows)", "PlayStation 4", "Xbox One", "Mac", "Nintendo Switch", "PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360", "Linux"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["18 (PEGI)", "M (ESRB)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action", "Adventure", "Horror", "Science fiction", "Single player", "Stealth", "Survival"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien:_Isolation", "title": "en.wikipedia.org", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490", "title": "store.steampowered.com", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://twitter.com/alienisolation", "title": "twitter.com", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://www.facebook.com/AlienIsolation", "title": "facebook.com", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/alienisolation", "title": "reddit.com", "source": "vernon"}, {"url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/AlienIsolation", "title": "youtube.com", "source": "vernon"}], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 267, "name": "Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/-jgtiJaR77g"}, {"id": 263, "name": "Improvise CGI Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/49420mdnMyo"}, {"id": 262, "name": "E3 Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/F5SpLrp9KpM"}, {"id": 266, "name": "Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/W9Xw5rGFE4E"}, {"id": 264, "name": "Launch Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/Whr7u_B6Jn0"}, {"id": 265, "name": "Announcement Trailer", "uri": "https://youtu.be/yCufM8ndxoQ"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "IGDB", "slug": "igdb"}, "source_identifier": "4754", "production_places": [], "production_dates": [{"date": "2014-10-07", "notes": "", "to_year": "2014"}], "labels": [122]}, {"id": 94169, "acmi_id": "317951", "title": "Alien underworld [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "alien-underworld-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Tattooed Media, Pagan Films, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Karena Slaninka and Sonya Pemberton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Big picture&#8221;.<br />\nIn August 1996 NASA claimed to have discovered a new type of life form from a 4 billion year old piece of Martian meteorite originally found in the Antarctic which contained fossilised remains of ancient tiny creatures - posing the theory that life indeed may have existed on Mars.

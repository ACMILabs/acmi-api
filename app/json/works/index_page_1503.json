In Minimata, Japan, people become contaminated by mercury poisoning from a nearby factory, while across America pesticides are sprayed on crops to kill insects. Rachel Carson releases the contentious book &#8220;Silent Spring&#8221;, challenging the notion that pesticide is not harmful. Her novel is only the start of a long and slow process to combat the initial belief that smog, contamination, dirt and pollution are necessary by-products to industrial prosperity. Greenpeace is formed and Environmental Protection agencies established to counteract the balance between people and the environment. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1963: picture power&#8221;; television arrives and brings with it the power of instant communication. Different schools of thought exist internationally as to the potential power of television - public service, political propaganda, or advertising tool. As millions of people across the world began to see the same events unfold at the same time, ultimately entertainment would win out. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1954: living longer&#8221;; the 1950s saw a marked increase in health and wellbeing in developed countries. National Health Services and Social Security were established with a charter of preventative health as well as a concerted effort to try and cure the epidemics which had ailed many, such as polio and tuberculosis. On an international scale the World Health Organisation is established to monitor the health of the world, in particular in developing countries with diseases such as smallpox. With the increased survival rate however came an inevitable by-product of longevity - over population.

Brett&#8217;s presence creates a constant sense of tension as everybody in the house – his mother Sandra (Lynette Curran), his two brothers Glenn (John Polson) and Steve (Anthony Hayes), his girlfriend Michelle (a fantastic performance from Toni Collete), Glenn&#8217;s wife Jackie (Jeanette Cronin), Steve&#8217;s pregnant girlfriend Nola (Anna Lise) and Sandra&#8217;s boyfriend George (Pete Smith) – treads carefully around Brett&#8217;s restrained anger. The film occasionally flashes forward to the arrest and trial of the three brothers, building up the suspense as we wait for Brett to explode into violence. </p>\n<p>The actual murder is never shown but the suspense of the film and the atmosphere created by a superb cast makes this a chilling experience. The film won four awards at the 1998 AFI Awards – Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay Adapted from Another Source. </p>\n<p>Cinematography by Tristan Milani.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners' families", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-boys-1998", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 906584, "name": "Rowan Woods", "creator_id": 11198, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906583, "name": "John Maynard", "creator_id": 51466, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906582, "name": "Robert Connolly", "creator_id": 64647, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906581, "name": "SBS Independant", "creator_id": 78461, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906580, "name": "Premium Movie Partnership", "creator_id": 29258, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906579, "name": "Australian Film Commission", "creator_id": 66813, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906578, "name": "Arenafilm", "creator_id": 64646, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 906577, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 28207, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/The_Boys_key_art_.jpeg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Image via TMDB.com", "credit_line": "Image via TMDB.com", "alt_text": "A theatrical release of the poster for The Boys, featuring a man with a goatee's haunted face superimposed over the title of the film", "width": 600, "height": 900, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

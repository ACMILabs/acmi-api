The hut appears to be a shop set up for tourists. It sells batik style clothing, and there is a sign post reading “Fiesta Batik Welcome”. There is a rudimentary brick church alongside the shop. We see Val Jellay walk down a dirt path past the church to join the other tourists on the bus.</p>\n<p>Back at the hotel or resort, the film shows a swimming pool, umbrellas, sun lounges and a lifesaving ring with the inscription “Regency Manila”.</p>\n<p>There is a road trip through the congested streets of Manila revealing colourful Jeepnies, Kalesas (horse drawn carriages), Volkswagen Beetles, a Kombi Van, taxis and local buses. We see street signs reading “Tokyo”, “Joy Mart” and “Gamma import-export” with the phone number.</p>\n<p>Maurie takes us across the river and we see what could be the art deco Quezon Bridge which spans the Pasig River in Manila.</p>\n<p>Originally shot on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:14:00 bamboo hut/shop at base of hill<br />\n00:00:17:00 Fiesta Batik sign<br />\n00:00:21:00 bamboo hut/shop with Val in kaftan<br />\n00:00:32:00 brick church<br />\n00:01:28:00 streets lined with Volkswagen Beetles</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:34:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Philippines - Description and travel", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Manila (Philippines) - Social conditions", "Places&nbsp;→ Philippines", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 992908, "name": "Maurie Fields", "creator_id": 83488, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 992909, "name": "Val Jellay", "creator_id": 84852, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "174942", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}, {"id": 213, "name": "Philippines", "slug": "philippines"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1960s-1970s", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1960s-1970s"}], "labels": [57728], "external_references": []}, {"id": 118223, "acmi_id": "B2003902", "title": "[Maurie Fields and Val Jellay Home Movies: Reel 2]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maurie-fields-and-val-jellay-home-movies-reel-2", "creator_credit": "Maurie Fields and Val Jellay", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia and Thailand, c. 1960s-1970s", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>This film is a snapshot of a family holiday in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>\n<p>Some of the footage is underexposed with a hair in the gate in some sections.</p>\n<p>The film opens with scenes shot from a tourist boat trip through the Khlongs (canals) of what could be the Chao Phraya River in the Thonburi area of Bangkok Thailand.

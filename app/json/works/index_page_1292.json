Seven diverse stories reflect the range of trials faced by people who have experienced life under numerous regimes, including Communism, Mujaheddin and the Taliban. Episode 1: Artist George Gittoes discuses his visit to Afghanistan, the stories of which inspired new work that speaks of harrowing tales. Episode 2: Professor Hala and Doctor Safi were once teacher and student at the University of Kabul. Their lives of politics, journalism and brutal persecution took them on separate courses until they both found asylum in Australia. Episode 3: In 1979 Abdullah Shariat left fourth year medical school to become a freedom fighter, in Northern Afghanistan, against the Communists. Episode 4: Karima Haroon is an exuberant young woman from Afghanistan who arrived in Australia as a boat refugee. Tragic circumstances have forced her to take responsibility for her entire family. Episode 5: Khadern Nori and Shafiq Monis are both from the Hazara tribe in Afghanistan. Following persecution by the Taliban they spent a treacherous journey aboard a boat travelling to Australia before spending a year in Woomera Detention Centre.

It&#8217;s all there from the howling wind, shutting doors, shadowy figures and things that go bump in the night to satanic rituals and mass murders and a good measure of blood and guts. It begins at a rural English estate at Headstone Manor where sometime before, a bloody massacre of eighteen people occurred, and ever since, the Manor has purported to be haunted by a satanic phenomena. Six scientists are sent to Headstone Manor to investigate and what follows is a parody of events building up to the planned killing of the scientists by the quite crazy &#8220;Sinister Man&#8221; (beautifully hammed up by Vincent Price), leader of the Satanic cult who inhabit the Manor. This is total spoof with lots of one-liners, soap-opera acting and a touch of Python humor - very British and quite entertaining. Stars well-known British TV comedian Kenny Everett as Dr Lukas Mandeville and Pamela Stephenson as Dr Barbara Coyle.

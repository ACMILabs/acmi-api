Marianne (Lio), his wife and mother of his two children, longs for him to return to the family home. David is still sexually active with Marianne and involved in their children&#8217;s lives. Lola meanwhile, is having an affair with a musician, Tom (Hippolyte Giradot), who is also married. Tom&#8217;s wife, Elisabeth, is aware of his extra-marital activities but is confident, as the mother of his children, of her power over him. Lola writes about her affairs with both men, pondering the meaning of her connection to them. Elisabeth and Marianne (the respective wives) are driven to despair by their husbands&#8217; indiscretions.

We see the children (James, Andrew and Margaret) with their mother and father playing on the seashore, building sandcastles together and drawing pictures in the sand. Joined by their pet dog, the children fill their buckets with sand and play with seaweed washed up onto the beach. There are good closeups of the children, reflecting examples of children’s fashion and hairstyles of the era.</p>\n<p>We see the children venture out to the edge of the water and then play along the top of the seawall. There is great delight while eating ice cream from cones, and tears shed when an adult takes an uninvited taste.</p>\n<p>The second, third and fourth sections of the film show the children on a summer’s day in a backyard. Tricycles, a blow-up wading pool with the backyard hose leading into it, swings and a sand pit create a great snapshot of children’s recreation, toys, and equipment particular to the era. We also see a young boy kicking what appears to be an American shaped football and two boys playing with toy cars and a toy police car.</p>\n<p>The fifth section of the film shows a young baby being held by her mother.

&#8220;Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences&#8221; in 2011.</p>\n<p>The two-channel installation &#8220;Track and Trials&#8221; sets up a relationship between two opposing screens. One features footage of track riding under the Sydney Harbour Bridge (track riding is a fixed, single gear, break-less style of bicycle riding that was developed in the velodrome but made popular by couriers in New York City in the late 1990s). The second features trials bike riding (a competitive off-road, all-terrain practice that also uses fixed gear bicycles) on a rocky ocean foreshore.</p>\n<p>Both trials and track riders stall their bicycles, often making themselves completely still. Gladwell is attracted to the contradiction between the potential speed of these bicycles and their capacity for stasis and perfect poise – the push and pull of these opposing forces. The Track screen references Grace Cossington-Smith’s painting &#8220;The Bridge in Curve&#8221; (1926), the Sydney Harbour Bridge near completion. Cossington-Smith celebrates not only the construction of the bridge as a triumph of engineering but also Australian modernism. Gladwell replicates Cossington-Smith’s perspective while celebrating the ways in which the riders have reclaimed the space underneath the bridge as a space for creativity, beyond the intended functionality of the space.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Trials screen references Caspar David Friedrich’s romantic painting &#8220;Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog&#8221; (1818), in which a man standing on a rocky outcrop looks out onto a stormy ocean. Like Friedrich’s subject, the trials rider is ‘wedged between two time signatures – the slow geological signature of the rocks and the furious swell of the ocean’, as Gladwell describes it. As the rider reaches the top of the rocks he rests, putting his feet to the ground, and takes in the view of the ocean from a vantage point he has worked hard to achieve. Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Gladwell’s rider is insignificant within a landscape while striving for mastery over it.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Track and Trials</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2011</p>", "description": "<p><i>Track and Trials</i> is a dual-channel video installation commissioned for the exhibition <i>Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences</i> in 2011.</p>\n<p>The two-channel installation <i>Track and Trials</i> sets up a relationship between two opposing screens.

&#8220;Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences&#8221; in 2011.</p>\n<p>The eight-screen &#8220;Parallel Forces&#8221; is Gladwell’s most ambitious exploration of the dual, mirrored image in terms of scale and composition. With four pairs of opposing screens set on the walls of the gallery like a hall of mirrors, it brings together the key elements of the classic ozploitation film – choppers, fast cars, motorcycles, daring physical feats and dramatic locations – and strips them of any cinematic logic or narrative to create a succession of experiments that play with point of view, audience perspective and the limits of speed.</p>\n<p>On each set of screens a body/machine performs a series of tightly sequenced manoeuvres in parallel while simultaneously fixing its gaze on its opposite across the gallery corridor. In &#8220;Parallel 2 x EC 120s (French Island)&#8221;, a cameraman, rigged to a harness attached to the interior of one of two identical Eurocopters, trains his camera on the other helicopter as they both hover above the wetlands and swoop through the rugged terrain of French Island, on Victoria’s south-east coast. The camera captures the impact of the choppers’ movement on the landscape – the brushed grass, the swaying branches. In &#8220;Parallel 2 x XBs (Silverton)&#8221; two interceptors (the modified black Ford from George Miller’s Mad Max series) flank each other on the dusty red highways of outback Broken Hill (the Mad Max series location), a cameraman perched on the window with his lens pointed at the vehicle opposite. The car wheels scar the earth with their combined speed and weight, red dust billowing in their wake. On the third set of screens, &#8220;Parallel 2 x R6s (M5)&#8221;, twin Yamaha YZs speed through Sydney’s M5 underpass. On the last set, &#8220;Parallel 2 x 4 ABEC 5s (Domain)&#8221;, two skateboarders train their cameras through the transparent barrier between the two travelators under Sydney’s Domain car park, again filming each other.</p>\n<p>Caught between these opposing parallels it is impossible for the viewer to calculate the speed and velocity of these bodies and machines. Perfectly matched in their movement and progress towards an unknown entity, there is a sense of movement yet there is no definite evidence that anything is moving at all. As Gladwell describes it: ‘If I were trying to direct a narrative feature with these elements I’d want the film to be the first “ambient” action film… &#8220;Parallel Forces&#8221; contains the fragments of a potential action film.

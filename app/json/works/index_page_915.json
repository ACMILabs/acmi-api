It is August 10, 1944 and there is much to wish for. The Germans are retreating. The Blackshirts, still loyal to The Duce, are sweeping the countryside with kamakaze ferocity. The American GI&#8217;s may arrive tomorrow, or never. An extraordinarly touching, involving, richly textured World War II drama of the final days of World War II prior to liberation by U.S. troops.

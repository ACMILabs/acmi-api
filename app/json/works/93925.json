The hacktivists (who range across the globe) are principally concerned with globalisation and capitalism. Their perception is that they are modern dissidents whose activities sit alongside, even boost and support, traditional forms of street protest. In this documentary, several hacktivists are interviewed, discussing their aims, politics and methodology, which may include bombarding companies with emails or performing cyber sit-ins, immobilising a website. These activities are not only effective but also pose a danger to big corporations with net-based trade.

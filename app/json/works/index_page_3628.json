Wallace was a creative force as a writer of his own material for vaudeville sketches and feature films and as a painter, musician, dancer and composer. From his early beginnings in country travelling shows and vaudeville, he became Australia&#8217;s first genuine box office star of the sound era appearing in five feature films and achieving international success. Using rare photographs, home movies, feature film footage and contemporary interviews, the filmmakers explore his personal and professional life and examine his lasting influence, thus restoring Wallace to his rightful place as a key figure in Australian entertainment history.

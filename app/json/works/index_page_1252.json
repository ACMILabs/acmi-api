Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film captures Jack’s family and friends enjoying their scrambler motor bikes in muddy conditions at Korweinguboora, near Ballarat, Victoria. There are also visits to Geelong Racecourse and to Melbourne for some rowing races.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:07:00 a member of Jack’s circle on a motorbike<br />\n00:00:25:00 a group likely to be members of the Radio Cabs cooperative that Jack and Marie established in Ballarat<br />\n00:00:28:00 translucent title across the screen, &#8216;Ballarat Harley Club Mud Scrambles at Korweinguboora…&#8217;<br />\n00:00:39:00 riding the muddy track with sidecars<br />\n00:01:00:00 scrambling motorcycle riders<br />\n00:01:17:00 a fall in the mud for a motorcyclist<br />\n00:01:25:00 two stylishly dressed women pose for the camera<br />\n00:01:48:00 horses racing at Geelong Racecourse followed by the camera panning out over the Racecourse attendees from a higher vantage point<br />\n00:02:31:00 two men cycling through a quiet town street<br />\n00:03:01:00 two women and a man posing for the camera in front of the Eureka Stockade Memorial in what appears to be a cold wind<br />\n00:03:14:00 rowing races on a river<br />\n00:03:30:00 strolling through public gardens</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:29:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Taxicab drivers", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motorcycles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Taxicab drivers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Automobiles - History", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Motorcycle racing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Rowing", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387494, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "9.5mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film.

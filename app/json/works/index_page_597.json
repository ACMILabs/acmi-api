&#8216;drop punt&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Bob Baker, Jack Dunlop, Dawn Teasdale and the Rupanyup Football Club. Archival film by John Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLES BLOWING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER:  I&#8217;d say it was about 1950, I started. And in those days, it was either a dropkick or a torp. And of course, the high-mark blokes always went crook if you weren&#8217;t kicking a dropkick, because they&#8217;d have a lark making torpedo kicks.</p>\n<p>The blokes who kicked good dropkicks were worth watching, but a lot of us, myself included, weren&#8217;t good dropkicks. And dropkicks were a problem because the ground, the surface changed. And OK, the natural base could always get away. But all the same, every now and again, you&#8217;d go to a different ground. Like you&#8217;d go up to the sandy ground up at Jeparit and even our best fellows would kick a grounder occasionally.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>JACK DUNLOP:  I loved it, actually. We were always doing it, from the time we first went to school. Because the drop punt had never been thought of when I gave it away. So we fancied it as a distance kick, on fine days. You didn&#8217;t do it on a wind day.</p>\n<p>Mainly the biggest thing with dropkicking was timing. If you didn&#8217;t time it, it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. But no, in later years, we had some pretty good big men, good high marks here. And your ambition was to get it as far as you could. They had a fair idea how far you could kick it, and you would kick to a contest. Not like today, where they won&#8217;t kick to a contest at all.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Those days, when they really used it, they all took their marks, went back and had their shots at goal and that. And they&#8217;d take up here but top it behind the head like this. Nobody ever does that these days.</p>\n<p>When you take a mark, you&#8217;ve got the ball.

Donald started reporting local football for the newspaper in 1947. Sixty years on he still enjoys reporting the sport and recognises its importance for local communities.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Robin Letts and Shane O&#8217;Shea.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>ROBIN LETTS:  I came out of the Navy towards the end of 1947 and came straight back into the office. And one of the first things I had to do was to start reporting local football. So I think I&#8217;d written my first footy report in 1947, so I&#8212; I had to count back, but I think that might be 60 years come next year.</p>\n<p>It never becomes boring because my wife and I go to a different game every week. Shirley gets out of the car in the freezing cold to take action shots of footballers, and I sit in the warmth, taking notes. And up to date, she hasn&#8217;t complained too much. So we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>\n<p>What we try to do is to cover it based on word and pictures and not to leave anybody out, if we can possibly help it. All the details, right down to the best players in the under-13 netballs and whatever.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>SHANE O&#8217;SHEA:  Robin needed a bit of a hand, so he said, do you want to cover a game? I started off in the reserves, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he had me in the seniors. It&#8217;s the closest I&#8217;ve ever got to senior football, I must admit. But it&#8217;s sort of grown from there. I&#8217;m at a game each Saturday, taking photos and just doing a report on that game.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re recording the history of the leagues and associations as it happens. And it&#8217;s vital that we keep presenting that and recording that and covering their achievements and promoting the sports as long as we can.</p>\n<p>ROBIN LETTS: We&#8217;ve found that, particularly at times like this, when we&#8217;ve had practically a 10-year drought and things have been so tough, that football and its allied sports are so important that they would be the only activity in our lives that, particularly at finals times, has the ability to virtually lift up the population of one town and shift it to another, and then bring it home again. And there&#8217;s nothing else in our lives quite like that.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s the conversation, going up the street every week. It&#8217;s the thing until next Saturday, and then you start again.</p>\n<p>If I were to retire, I know what would happen. Shirley would have me straight into the garden.

A lot of the guys worked out in the bush, worked in the mills, you know, that line of work, physical hard, physical work, sort of went and played at the Snowy Rovers, whereas the bank people, the accountants and schoolteachers, all tended to come to the Orbost footy club. And it was pretty full-on rivalry.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS:  Friday nights, I think you would have found that Rovers went up to the top hotel and the Orbost boys went down to the bottom hotel. You probably went to one butcher if he was a member of the Rovers, or a member of the Orbost, say, you went to him.</p>\n<p>But it was really one eyed football, wasn&#8217;t it? But then once football was over, we were all friends again, because we all live in the same town, after all, don&#8217;t we? And we all have to live here.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>RITA BAKER: Saturdays, your friends became your enemies.</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: Yes.</p>\n<p>RITA BAKER: And the barracking at the football, Orbost used to be down one end, and the Rovers would be at the other end of the ground, and never the twain should meet. Otherwise it was on.</p>\n<p>[HORNS HONKING]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: They started to talk about amalgamation. Some agreed. Some didn&#8217;t. At first, I was against it, because you don&#8217;t like giving up your main team. But eventually we had to, because we knew if we didn&#8217;t join, we wouldn&#8217;t have a team.</p>\n<p>Mainly because young ones were going away for employment, going to college, university, and getting jobs. There was no jobs here. Everything was closing down in the town. So that&#8217;s why we sort of had to join up .</p>\n<p>PETER JENKINS: Prior to the merger, the only times both clubs had full numbers was when we were playing each other. We would go away and play advanced, and kids would end up playing thirds. Under-17s and them would play reserves. And there&#8217;d be reserves players played reserves, and then played seniors, because you really struggled. And you know, it was becoming quite embarrassing.</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: A little bit like a religion. You know, you change your religion, more or less, when you&#8217;re closing down one club and going to something different. And that&#8217;s how it felt. And probably Rita felt the same. You know, you&#8217;re losing all those years that you were with one club.</p>\n<p>It was hard at first. It was hard for me to go down into the Orbost sheds. But we&#8217;ve got over that.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>-We just sort of assembled down at the club rooms on a Saturday morning, and we&#8217;re given a choice of picking out our new shirt.</p>\n<p>-T-shirt.</p>\n<p>-T-shirt with the new emblem and that on.</p>\n<p>[APPLAUSE]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: We walked out arm in arm, and they took our photos, and everybody cheered us, said we&#8217;d done the right thing.  And I thought, well, you know, everything must be going to be all right.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>PETER JENKINS: All the mates that used to play against each other are all starting to come back and actually playing together, and they&#8217;re loving it. From a playing perspective, things are really positive. And I&#8217;d love to be part of the first part of success here, and I&#8217;m hoping that comes sooner rather than later.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Changing religion</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Malcolm McKinnon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>VIC/Australia, 2007</p>", "description": "<p>In response to a dwindling population, the Snowy Rovers and Orbost Football Clubs were driven to merge into the Orbost Snowy Rovers.

A lot of the guys worked out in the bush, worked in the mills, you know, that line of work, physical hard, physical work, sort of went and played at the Snowy Rovers, whereas the bank people, the accountants and schoolteachers, all tended to come to the Orbost footy club.

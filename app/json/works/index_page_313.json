Dialogue is pared down to a minimum; instead the camera observes its characters framed against the contrasting urban sprawl of Tokyo and the windswept coast of rural Japan. The meditative and richly poetic mise-en-scene explores the importance of environment, nature and landscape in defining a person&#8217;s relationship to the world. Recalling the films of Japan&#8217;s celebrated director Ozu, &#8220;Maborosi&#8221; is a deeply affecting and richly rewarding art film which reaffirms that cinema too can be a place for the creation of transcendental and spiritual works that assist in defining that complex, ambiguous phenomena which is the human condition.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Landscape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Japan - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995771, "name": "Hirokazu Koreeda", "creator_id": 79762, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q740758", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995770, "name": "Kore-eda", "creator_id": 79761, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995769, "name": "Naoe Gozu", "creator_id": 33482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995768, "name": "TV Man Union", "creator_id": 33454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49722", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [31782], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92291, "acmi_id": "315523", "title": "I Stand alone = Seul contre tous (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-stand-alone-seul-contre-tous-d", "creator_credit": "Gaspar Noe, Lucile Hadzihalilovic, Les Cinemas de la Zone and Alliance Atlantis", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An unemployed butcher returns to his native Paris after having bashed his lover and forced her to miscarriage.

Hoefgan is a talented, if vain actor who is not above flattery and manipulation of those around him to achieve his ambitious ends. A man who once had left wing political leanings, Hoefgen is forced to renounce his personal politics and even betray former colleagues in order to gain favour with the Nazis and advance his career. &#8220;Mephisto&#8221; is a compelling portrait of an artist whose ambition is in conflict with his integrity.

The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family.

Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema. From the opening sequence where the camera flies across the island, to a stunning tracking shot of a man navigating his canoe through a village perched on water, to the final rousing march of the revolutionaries descending from the hills, the film is an intoxicating series of marvellous choreographed set pieces. Though Mikhail&#8217;s influences are clearly those of silent cinema, the score and soundtrack to &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is also equally powerful, experimental and emotionally rich. The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA). It is certainly florid and melodramatic but the propaganda is not hard to take - not when it is so sumptuously presented and not when, as the four narrative sequences make abundantly clear, the causes for revolution are ethically and economically justified.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>I am Cuba = Soy Cuba = Ya Kuba [DVD]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Mikhail Kalatozov, Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC) and Mosfilm</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Cuba, 1964</p>", "description": "<p>A co-production between Cuba and the Soviet Union, Mikhail Kalatozov&#8217;s &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is by turns stirring, affecting, highly entertaining and quite often experimental in execution and structure.

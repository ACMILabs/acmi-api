The documentary which opens the program follows Kylian&#8217;s visit to the Groot Eylandt tribal dance congregation in 1986 where his dance production Stamping Ground was first conceived. In Stamping Ground Kylian sought to underline the common qualities of ballet and Aboriginal tribal dance as well as fuse the two styles into a work that comments on the universal nature of human movement as a form of cultural and personal expression. Following interviews with the Dance company performers about the piece and footage of rehearsals demonstrating movements inspired by Kylian&#8217;s time at the Groot Eylandt congregation, the second half of the program is a presentation of the final performance of Stamping Ground by the Netherlands Dance Theatre Company.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Dances", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Groote Eylandt (N.T.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Dances", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Choreography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance companies", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Nederlands Dans Theater", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "People&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Places&nbsp;→ Groote Eylandt (N.T.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 814808, "name": "Nederlandse Omroep Stichting", "creator_id": 20854, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814809, "name": "RM Arts", "creator_id": 22905, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 814810, "name": "David Muir", "creator_id": 12189, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 814807, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50800", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [32762]}, {"id": 93709, "acmi_id": "317290", "title": "Road to Singapore", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "road-to-singapore", "creator_credit": "Paramount Pictures, Harlan Thompson and Victor Schertzinger", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1940", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1940-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Comedy venture from the team of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, &#8220;The Road to Singapore&#8221; is a sprightly film that consistently amuses and entertains.

At this faraway place, accessible only by water and once flooded by a tidal wave, Ramiro&#8217;s movements are kept in check by two local officials, whose interaction recalls the comic routines of Abbot and Costello. Though in exile, Ramiro gradually becomes acquainted with the local villagers and falls in love with a rather eccentric Spanish woman burdened with minding her mad father. Director Ricardo Larrain portrays the remote village as a mythic, natural, and innocent world, where our hero rekindles love and stumbles upon a past era buried beneath the water. In this way, Larrain affirms the richness of local cultures in opposition to the frenetic, superficial nature of the modern city.

Yahine&#8217;s struggle to reconcile his art with his ambitions and personal failings is set against Egypt&#8217;s divisive drive, in the 1980s, toward democratic reform. The film takes on a surreal flavour with several musical interludes (one delightfully recalling &#8220;Singin&#8217; in the rain&#8221; as Yehia and Amr celebrate winning the Silver Bear award at Berlin). Chahine applies his signature energy to the film - an appealing mix of whimsy, satire and barbed attacks on the political and social situation in his beloved homeland.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Arabic", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Egypt - Social life and customs", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Docudrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ambition", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Creative ability", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Egypt", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Foreign language films", "Motion picture sequels", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2084496, "name": "Youssef Chahine", "creator_id": 72767, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q312611", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2084486, "name": "La Sept Cinema", "creator_id": 28807, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2084491, "name": "Misr International Films", "creator_id": 36372, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q12071690", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2084493, "name": "Paris Classics", "creator_id": 36390, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034816", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115611, "acmi_id": "S01454", "title": "Alexandria Trilogy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "alexandria-trilogy", "creator_credit": "Youssef Chahine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Egypt", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 100505, "acmi_id": "318252", "title": "Alexandria again and forever", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "alexandria-again-and-forever", "creator_credit": "Youssef Chahine, Le Sept, Misr International Films and Paris Classics", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Egypt, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47103, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2834256"}]}, {"id": 94424, "acmi_id": "318274", "title": "Alexandria, why? = Iskindiria, leh?

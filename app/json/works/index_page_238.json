She meets the kind and confused Thomas (Martin Donovan), who is suffering from amnesia and wandering the streets of New York in search of clues to his past, a past of viciousness and exploitation that only the appearance of his traumatized porn queen ex-wife, Sophia (Elina Lowensohn), begins to unravel. Intertwined with suspenseful thriller qualities and the subtlety of an unlikely romance, this film quietly spirals into a poignant tale of the pursuit of the reality of identity through memory and engagement with the past which leads sensitively to the inevitable tragedy of the final showdown.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Pornography", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amnesia", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/amateur", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1972582, "name": "Hal Hartley", "creator_id": 10205, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q446294", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972581, "name": "Hal Hartley", "creator_id": 10205, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q446294", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972580, "name": "Ted Hope", "creator_id": 77844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972579, "name": "True Fiction Pictures", "creator_id": 27087, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972578, "name": "Zenith Entertainment", "creator_id": 32671, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972577, "name": "UGC Images", "creator_id": 25649, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48410", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [30569], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91078, "acmi_id": "314156", "title": "Witchfinder General", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "witchfinder-general", "creator_credit": "Michael Reeves, Philip Waddilove, Arnold Louis Miller and Louis M Heyward", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1968", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The sinister subject of this film becomes apparent in the opening scene, where shots of an old woman being dragged, screaming, through the streets of a village are juxtaposed against those of a lone figure calmly tending the gallows on a barren, windswept hilltop.

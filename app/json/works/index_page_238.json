As a town with no sheriff, Dodge City is such a town - violent, lawless and ruled by the local saloon owner who murders any individual that tries to collect on honest debts. As a principled and fearless man, Hatton is implored to be sheriff and clean up Dodge City. Flynn is well cast as Hatton, a charming and handsome cowboy. Oliva de Havilland (who starred as Maid Marion in The Adventures of Robin Hood) plays his love interest Abbie Irving, a schoolteacher and journalist. As a Western intended for the Saturday matinee &#8220;Dodge City&#8221; is replete with scenes of cattle stampedes, bar room brawls and runaway trains. &#8220;Dodge City&#8221; features some glorious exterior scenes and was filmed in Technicolour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Kansas", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Frontier and pioneer life", "Places&nbsp;→ Kansas", "Romance", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/dodge-city", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961560, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961561, "name": "Michael Curtiz", "creator_id": 1714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50553", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1939", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1939"}], "labels": [32539], "external_references": [{"id": 80, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q577872"}, {"id": 4005, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "17660"}]}, {"id": 81294, "acmi_id": "302366", "title": "Doctor Zhivago", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "doctor-zhivago", "creator_credit": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, United Artists Corporation, Carlo Ponti and David Lean", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Doctor Zhivago is a moving story of love and romance told against the flaming background of the Russian Revolution.

A Palestinian filmmaker (played by director, Elia Suleiman), who lives in the Occupied Territories, is in love with an Arab woman who lives in Israel. Though they live in the same city, the consequences of occupation mean that they can only meet intermittently at the border checkpoints; and only always under the surveillance of Israeli soldiers. In the mean time, the film director has to contend with a dying father, a film script he is writing that will not settle into any defined order, and with his own fantasies of violence and despair. Around him, &#8220;Divine Intervention&#8221; situates Jewish, Muslim and Orthodox Christian communities in which tensions between neighbours, petty arguments and squabbles over relationships and personal histories, mirror the larger realities of war, occupation and terror. The audacious strengths of this exhilarating film lie in Suleiman&#8217;s ability to find the comic and the absurd in the most extreme and horrific of situations.

Garrett, with screenplay by Dudley Nichols, &#8220;The Hurricane&#8221; is set on the French colonised island Manakoora in the South Seas ruled by the cold and ruthless Governor Eugene De Laage (Raymond Massey) along with his kind-hearted and sensitive wife, Madame Germaine De Laage (Mary Astor). However the main characters of the story are the island chief&#8217;s daughter Marama (Dorothy Lamour) and her handsome hero husband, Terangi (John Hall) who is wrongly jailed whilst visiting in Tahiti. With Terangi&#8217;s escape and bid to return to his wife and his island home the story takes on an intensity that finally erupts into a breath-taking and havoc-wreaking finale. A classic film with a cast including C. Aubrey Smith, Thomas Mitchell, John Carradine and Jerome Cowan.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France - Colonies", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Oceania", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Hurricanes", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ France - Colonies", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Places&nbsp;→ Oceania", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-hurricane-1937", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999741, "name": "John Ford", "creator_id": 62487, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51114", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999740, "name": "Samuel Goldwyn", "creator_id": 22400, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q72579", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999739, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52739", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1937", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1937"}], "labels": [34219], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94712, "acmi_id": "318699", "title": "Angels over Broadway", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "angels-over-broadway", "creator_credit": "Lee Garmes, Ben Hecht and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1940", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1940-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Angels over Broadway is a stylish looking black and white crime drama which takes place on one rainy night in New York.

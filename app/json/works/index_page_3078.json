Twelve year-old Yusef (Mohammad Nahhal) lives in a refugee camp with his mother and older sister. His father is in prison and his older brother is on the run from the Israeli soldiers. To escape the surrounding violence Yusef constantly lives in an imaginary world, but it is his bird hunting in the near-by countryside that allows Yusef a sense of freedom and space. It is here that Yusef meets Aida (Hana Nemah), the wild and lovely young gypsy girl from a local gypsy camp, whose beguiling eyes and smile Yusef finds hard to resist. He soon declares his love for Aida telling her he will marry her when they grow up. However Aida sets a task for Yusef before she will agree to marriage, that being he must first find three jewels missing from her grandmother&#8217;s necklace, which was brought from South America by her grandfather. And so the adventure begins as Yusef, determined, sets out on his quest to find the three missing jewels with the help of Aida and his very close friend Salah (Ghassan Abur Libda) who comes from a wealthy and influential family of orange growers. These three young Palestinian friends from such disparate backgrounds are each portrayed sensitively by the young actors involved.

The film is a fascinating &#8216;slice-of-life&#8217; view of working class life in Britain of the 60s, whose entrancing black and white cinematography, reminiscent of Bill Brandt&#8217;s photography of working class England, contrasts with the gauche and drab reality of the characters&#8217; surrounds. This controversial film dealt with many taboo topics on the day - teen pregnancy, inter-racial romance, homosexuality, child abandonment, without excessive sermonising on the topics, typical of American moral dramas of the 1950s. Cast includes Dora Bryan, Rita Tushingham, Robert Stephens, Murray Melvin, Paul Danquah and David Boliver.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Unwanted", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-taste-of-honey", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998918, "name": "Tony Richardson", "creator_id": 62037, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q52411", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998915, "name": "Bryanston Films", "creator_id": 23052, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998916, "name": "Continental", "creator_id": 26186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998917, "name": "Woodfall Film Productions", "creator_id": 61992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52030", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [33664]}, {"id": 94149, "acmi_id": "317931", "title": "Silent Shakespeare", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "silent-shakespeare", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>In Silent Shakespeare, film historian Luke McKernan showcases a compilation of extracts from early film adaptations of the Bard&#8217;s more regularly performed plays.

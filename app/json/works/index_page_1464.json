Cameos by: Andy Dick, Janeane Garafalo, Kathy Griffin, Eric Roberts, Owen Wilson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-cable-guy", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2335368, "name": "Ben Stiller", "creator_id": 72225, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q47100", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2335366, "name": "Judd Apatow", "creator_id": 80652, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q325396", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2335364, "name": "Jeffrey A.

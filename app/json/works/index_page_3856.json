Anthropologists from the west visted the country as an example of a preserved culture. Canadian tourist and photographer, Elaine Briere, visited in 1974; her photos remain as some of the only documents that attest to the peaceful existence of the country prior to invasion. Briere presents a harsh case against Western society, in particular Canada, and their complicity in allowing the military elite of the Suharto government to invade East Timor. A move that was motivated by a desire to control raw material and exploit new markets. Briere&#8217;s photographs and the testimonies provided by East Timorese who survived to tell of the atrocities that occurred are compiled as a photo documentary of the solidarity movement. More than anything, this documentary is a moving tribute to a country with a determination to maintain their independence and culture from assimilation, as well as promoting awareness of the East Timor occupation.

That evening, while the rest of the staff enjoy an introductory dance party, Fang works away in her office. Gao Yang, one of the new test pilots, asks Fang to dance with him, but she rudely declines.

Although she believes he is irresponsible, he is the most qualified for the job.

Later that night, Fang visits the hanger where &#8216;Blue Sky&#8217; is being prepared for its test the next morning. Gao Yang arrives soon after.

They go for a walk together, and Gao asks Fang why she never remarried, given how difficult it must be to work and raise a daughter alone. She tells him that she has not met anyone who understands her passion for her demanding job.

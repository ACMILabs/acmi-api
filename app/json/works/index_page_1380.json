Steam locomotives puffing their way into country towns were the life blood of the state, bringing in supplies and visitors and taking away produce and goods. Today the steam locomotives have been replaced. Many were left to rust and decay but a number of them have been restored by dedicated groups of volunteers, determined to preserve this exciting part of our heritage. Steam trains are alive again in Victoria and this magnificent videotape is a tribute to those groups who have kept the locomotives on the tracks to give pleasure to those who love steam travel. You can enjoy the thrill of the journey, the heat of the firebox and the shrill of the whistle as you watch &#8220;Steam Alive in Victoria&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroad trains", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroads - Australia", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Steam-engines", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Steam-engines"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783108, "name": "Greg Naylor", "creator_id": 25817, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783107, "name": "Tri-Media Services", "creator_id": 25816, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 783106, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39633", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [23194]}, {"id": 83710, "acmi_id": "304968", "title": "Steam across the mountains: the story of the Zig Zag Railway", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "steam-across-the-mountains-the-story-of-the-zig-zag-railway", "creator_credit": "Nick A'Hern, ABC Video and Nick A'Hern Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The Zig Zag Railway is regarded as an engineering marvel and a mecca to students of engineering the world over.

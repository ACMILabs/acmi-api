THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>Star From Afar is a powerful example of Socialist Realism, an art form developed in the Soviet Union to promote the ideals of socialism and communism. The film unquestionably aims to communicate a positive communist message to its audience. Yunyun&#8217;s father is labeled a &#8220;capitalist sympathiser&#8221; and disciplined accordingly, learning a valuable lesson about the assets of Socialist China. The film frowns upon old-fashioned values such as male chauvinism and champions the modernisation of China, particularly the progression of women.<br />\n(2 stars - Aleena Glentis; November 3, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:30:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ China - Rural conditions", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Dairy farming", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Collective farms", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - Cultural Revolution, 1966-1969", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890002, "name": "Xiaoxiang Film Studio", "creator_id": 34757, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890003, "name": "Wu Peimin", "creator_id": 82609, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 890004, "name": "Bicheng Bi", "creator_id": 82579, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890005, "name": "Zhou Shengtong", "creator_id": 82610, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890006, "name": "Gao Ling", "creator_id": 82611, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890007, "name": "Wang Yuzhong", "creator_id": 82612, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890008, "name": "Kang Tai", "creator_id": 82613, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890009, "name": "Ma Jing", "creator_id": 82614, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146441", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [55289], "external_references": []}, {"id": 77233, "acmi_id": "015454", "title": "Star award program", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "star-award-program", "creator_credit": "Coaching Association of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An instructional film, without commentary, for synchronised swimmers.

Lanza plays Damon Vincenti, an unknown tenor who is plucked from obscurity when he is discovered by society patroness Kendall Hale (Joan Fontaine). With smooth impresario Charles Winthrop (Vincent Price) and voice teacher Maestro Marcatello (Joseph Calleia) behind him Vincenti is on the road to a great career as a tenor, but he becomes mesmerised by Kendall Hale. Hale has already had a string of heartbroken men who have been her pet projects in the past, and Damon is set to be her next victim. On the night of his debut at the New York Opera she drops him for her next protege. Damon is devastated and flees in the middle of his debut. He escapes to Mexico and is unable to sing. He is &#8216;rescued&#8217; by Juana Montes (Sara Montiel) a fiery but patient Mexican girl whose father was a bull fighter. Eventually Damon marries Juana and they head back to America to restart his career. A showdown between the two women is set up as they fight over Vincenti. Fans of Lanza&#8217;s voice will appreciate the numerous songs he sings in this film, including &#8220;Serenade&#8221;,&#8221;Ave Maria&#8221; and &#8220;Nessun Dorma&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Opera singers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Excerpts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tenors (Singers)", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957354, "name": "Anthony Mann", "creator_id": 11238, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957353, "name": "Henry Blanke", "creator_id": 1613, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957352, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957351, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45383", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1956", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1956"}], "labels": [27944]}, {"id": 76143, "acmi_id": "013928", "title": "Serama's mask", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "seramas-mask", "creator_credit": "Paul Saltzman, Deepa Saltzman and Sunrise Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;World cultures and youth&#8221;<br />\nSerama, a Balinese boy, has been learning the intricate, ancient art of the Balinese dance since he was seven.

Ordinary family events - the visit of parents to see the children and their cool reception - are profoundly moving as Ozu portrays them. &#8216;Tokyo Story&#8217; is actually a recasting of Leo McCarey&#8217;s &#8216;Make Way For Tomorrow&#8217; which his collaborator, Noda, had seen but Ozu had not. As in most of his later films there is a pervasive nostalgia, a sense of loss. Although a loosely plotted leisurely survey of the extended family structured around journeys, the film is full of conflicts triggered by the grandparents&#8217; visit in which characterisation both enriches and qualifies stark thematic oppositions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:09:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Japanese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Japan", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Japan - Social life and customs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Japan", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/tokyo-story", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1991718, "name": "Yasujiro Ozu", "creator_id": 29406, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991717, "name": "Tasheki Yamomoto", "creator_id": 29405, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43847", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [26902], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87410, "acmi_id": "309350", "title": "The Italian job", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-italian-job", "creator_credit": "Peter Collinson, Michael Deeley and Paramount Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1969", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>When Charlie (Michael Caine) leaves jail he has the opportunity for a better future, or a sure fire way of landing back in jail when he inherits the plans to a $4,000,000 gold robbery.

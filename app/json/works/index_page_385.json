During the last century, theatre was challenged by mass entertainment in the form of cinema, television and the internet. The one thing that has made theatre stand apart is its quality of being &#8220;live&#8221;, allowing an immediate interaction between actors and audience. In this program, Richard Eyre explores how theatre has survived and why it will continue to survive - from the influences of Antonin Artaud&#8217;s &#8220;theatre of cruelty&#8221;, to the commercial popular culture of the blockbuster musicals, to the experimental and avant-garde. He takes us into the 1980s and 90s through discussion, interviews and excerpts, analysing the commercialisation of theatre; the audience; the fusion of traditional theatre with multimedia technology such as robotics, puppetry and film; the construction and reconstruction of theatres, eg the National Theatre, the Olivier Theatre and the Globe Theatre.

The aftermath of WW II influenced the direction of theatre and allowed a whole new generation of playwrights the freedom to express their anger, their political allegiance, social realism and an attitude that you could do or say what you want on stage - theatre became the instrument of social change. However, it was first German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), then Irish born Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) who inspired the 1960s and 70s generation of playwrights. Brecht, a communist, was known as a &#8220;theorist about theatre&#8221; who challenged the traditional values of theatre creating experimental and revolutionary works around his theory of alienation, promoting a style of acting and staging that created a distancing effect. Samuel Beckett was the man of evocative language, his plays often shrouded in despair and bleakness, combined with a lacing of caustic humor and left-wing politics. Richard Eyre presents indepth biographical backgrounds of each of these playwrights, including excerpts from their plays &#8220;The Resistible rise of Arturo Ui&#8221; and &#8220;Galileo&#8221; (Brecht), and &#8220;Waiting for Godot&#8221; (Beckett). Also features playwrights Edward Bond, Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill, David Hare, Alan Bennett, Tom Stoppard and others along with film clips, excerpts and interviews. In addition, the program provides an historical overview of Britain during the 60s and 70s, the political and sexual freedom and the social mores of a society in the throes of a revolution - in fact, the whole world seemed to be in a state of protest in 1968. Follows through to the 1970s, to 1979 and the beginning of Thatcherism in Britain.

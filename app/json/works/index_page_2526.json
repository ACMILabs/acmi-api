So Haghi tries everything to confuse the secret service and to neutralize No 326. The granddaddy of all espionage movies. All the elements are here: government secrets, phony disguises, masterful strategies, sabotage, revenge, secret codes, hidden microphones, beautiful female spies, exciting chases and murder! Behind everything is a deranged but brilliant master spy in control of the entire spies network. Director Fritz Lang dishes up a delightful combination of suspiscion, terror and paranoia - a chilling reflection of the nightmarish atmosphere of pre-Hitler Germany. Silent film with English intertitles. Adapted by Thea von Harbou (a long time Lang collaborator and author of &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;Mabuse&#8221;) from her novel. (Edgar G.

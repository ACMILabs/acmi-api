On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur (Richard Attenborough) secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs ressurected from extinction through the use of fossilised DNA. Before opening it to the public he invites renowned paleontologist (Sam Neill), paleobotanist (Bruce Dern) and mathematician (Jeff Goldblum) with his two grandchildren, to experience the park - with fatal results. This entertaining film carries a strong message regarding the use of science for material gain and to manipulate life.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:02:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "English", "English", "English", "German", "German", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Polish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dinosaurs", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 910507, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 910508, "name": "Amblin Entertainment", "creator_id": 67925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 910509, "name": "Kathleen Kennedy", "creator_id": 72104, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 910510, "name": "Gerald Molen", "creator_id": 77735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 910511, "name": "Steven Spielberg", "creator_id": 72103, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 910506, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48578", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [30724], "external_references": []}, {"id": 69322, "acmi_id": "005781", "title": "Jupiter odyssey", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jupiter-odyssey", "creator_credit": "United States.

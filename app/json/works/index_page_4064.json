The comedy/horror film which gave rise to the term splatstick proudly lives up to it&#8217;s bad taste title, offering many gross moments of extreme gore, inventively executed on it&#8217;s shoestring budget. The bare bones plot revolves a round a team of alien hunters (the Astro Investigation and Defence Service with the unfortunate acronym of AIDS), who have been sent into the sleepy New Zealand town of Kaihoro where a gang of nasty extra-terrestrials lead by the ghastly Lord Crumb, have taken over. Of course much blood and viscera is spilt as the team discover the aliens evil plan to turn the inhabitants of the town into food. Cast includes Terry Potter, Peter Jackson, Peter O&#8217;Herne, Craig Smith, Mike Minett and Doug Wren.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Horror", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Life on other planets"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 806922, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4465", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 806921, "name": "Wingnut Films", "creator_id": 31880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48291", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [30461]}, {"id": 79154, "acmi_id": "323992", "title": "Bacteria and Health (Captioned)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bacteria-and-health-captioned", "creator_credit": "Haruo Asai and Masaji Hara", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Diagrams and experiments show that by taking simple precautions such as disinfecting and dressing wounds, washing hands in soapy water and being aware of the presence of bacteria, we can remain healthy.

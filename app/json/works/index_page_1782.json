After many years in prison a dying woman&#8217;s confession finally clears Lee of the murder. Although supposedly based on fact it seems likely that the silent film versions were based on a play performed in Australia in 1912. The success of the first film version (now lost) made in the same year led the distributors Haldane and Sherry to produce a new version in 1921 expanding the story to include scenes from Lee&#8217;s happy childhood. Piety and intensity of emotion are emphasised and the film is at times crudely sentimental. Despite negative reviews the remake was again very successful with the public. Raymond Longford remade the story as a talkie in 1934; this third version has also been lost. Cast includes Rose Rooney, David Edelsten Cinematography by Tasman G. Higgins.

Season One introduces Nobel Prize-winning economist and unabashed intellectual president Jed Bartlet and his key staff members, a newly elected Democratic administration trying to find its footing amidst the corridors of the White House&#8217;s west wing. The series is driven by its artful, intelligent, rapid-fire dialogue from the pen of creator, co-executive producer and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (who also scripted &#8216;A Few Good Men&#8217;, &#8216;The American President&#8217; and &#8216;Malice&#8217;), delivered by an exceptional ensemble cast. Plotlines centre on the daily challenges faced by the highly strung, over-ambitious staff closest to the president - the press secretary, chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, and deputy communications director - who carry on most of their frenetically paced, but always articulate, conversations while striding purposefully through the corridors and offices of the West Wing. In a departure from the usual team-writing approach to television drama, Sorkin alone wrote every episode for the first four seasons of the series. Though not immune to moments of cloying patriotism and sentimentalism, the series sustains a liberal sensibility and manages to realistically convey the murky complexities of decision-making and spin-doctoring in the American government. Cast includes Rob Lowe, Martin Sheen, Bradley Whitford, John Spencer, Allison Janney, Dule Hill, Richard Schiff, Moira Kelly.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episodes 5-8 of the first season of the much awarded and critically acclaimed US television series about the behind-the-scenes machinations of White House.

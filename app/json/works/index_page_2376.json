Spanning the period 1933-1956, it tells the story of Lucja Krol (Magda Teresa Wojcik), an unemployed widow with four sons, and her struggle to survive almost twenty-five years of economic depression, poverty, occupation of Poland by the Nazis, persecution and political oppression. To Lucja, holding the family together was paramount. For her sons, it was the fight for an independent Poland, free of Nazi Germany control, and a total commitment to the Communist Party. However, at the end of the war with a new regime in Poland, another form of persecution began to take place. Instead of freedom and peace, the 1950s became a time of fear, when friend betrayed friend and former heroes of the independence struggle were jailed as traitors - a time of expedient political trials, torture and even death. It is during this time that Klemens (Boguslaw Linda) Lucja&#8217;s son, is inexplicably arrested and accused of being a collaborator. His eventual fate is never revealed to Lucja.

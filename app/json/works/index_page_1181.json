The Ladies&#8217; Committee of the Shepparton Football Club serve up endless meals on a Thursday night and cater for weddings, parties, anything in order to keep their club afloat.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Val Dominelli, Jan Enders, Roe Harrap, and Tom Greenaway.</p>\n<p>Further Information<br />\nTRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  I joined the ladies&#8217; committee in 1956. I was a very quiet, shy, retiring girl, and my mum brought me along to join the ladies&#8217; committee. We both joined at the same time. And I&#8217;ve been on the committee ever since.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>The ladies&#8217; committee is the main fundraiser for the club. We do a lot of catering. Over the years, we&#8217;ve done lots of weddings, and we&#8217;ll do anything to raise money, any sort of function that we can run in this room.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>We raise about $26,000 to $28,000, depending on what functions we have through the years. And the club, you know, they just couldn&#8217;t survive without that money.</p>\n<p>We have tea every Thursday night in the football season. We usually start the pre-season. All the players come in. Committees, supporters&#8212; anybody&#8217;s welcome. And home games, we just run the canteens. And I start early, about quarter past 7:00, every Saturday, and the others come in about 8:00.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>JAN ENDERS:  I&#8217;ve had three sons play over the years. And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back. I said, well, just get me some boots and I&#8217;ll be right.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:04:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

Created at ‘collage camp’ at Bundanon on beautiful Yuin Country, this collaborative work is a poetic and urgent warning.</p>\n<p>Deborah Kelly is a Sydney-based artist whose works have been shown around Australia, and in the Biennales of Singapore, Sydney, Thessaloniki, TarraWarra and Venice. Her projects across media are concerned with lineages of representation, politics and history in public exchange, and practices of collectivity on small and large scale, both fleeting and durational. Her newest works experiment with models of sustained creative collaboration between strangers. Kelly’s moving image artworks have been shown around the world, in galleries, cinemas and projected onto rock formations, buildings and clouds.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>The Gods of Tiny Things</i> is a vast, microscopic Eden teeming with deities born from the pages of old magazines and encyclopedias, creating an exquisite collage of grotesque beauty and new mythologies.

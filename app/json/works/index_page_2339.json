The children in &#8220;Together&#8221; are realistically depicted, in particular Elisabeth&#8217;s children, Eva (Emma Samuelsson), a depressed and lonely teen, and Stefan (Sam Kessel), who longs for his father and a return to the nuclear family. Elisabeth&#8217;s brother Goran (Gustav Hammarsten) is the lynchpin of the house, a peacekeeper who aims to keep all members of the commune from warring with each other, despite his own woes with his partner, Lena. &#8220;Together&#8221; is a moving and funny tale of individuals, groups, couples, children, outsiders, swingers, ideologues, families, neighbours and friends.

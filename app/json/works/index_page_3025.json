Like the paintings of Lucian Freud, Billingham crafts a terrible beauty from the landscape of family life and its patterns of pathos, despair and hope.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A high-rise flat in the U.K. Midlands. Ray is the father who drinks, Liz the mother, Jason the brother. There are some animals and the brother kills flies. The older brother films them with his handycam - intently observing whatever is going on.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Richard Billingham&#8217;s &#8216;Ray&#8217;s a Laugh&#8217; was hailed as the photo book of the decade. His photographs were one of the talking points of &#8216;Sensation&#8217;. Billingham has now made &#8216;Fishtank&#8217;, a commission for television by Artangel in collaboration with film-maker Adam Curtis and Illuminations TV for BBC2&#8217;s acclaimed TV series. The &#8216;video verite&#8217; of Fishtank is contained within the compressed space/fishtank of the flat. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they argue. Billingham&#8217;s film registers the emotional temperature of this space and the family who live there with a closeness that transcends camera conventions. Like the paintings of Lucian Freud, Billingham crafts a terrible beauty from the landscape of family life and its patterns of pathos, despair and hope.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:43:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["MA", "Mediatheque - not for children (ACMI classified)", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 1}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1728559, "name": "Richard Billingham", "creator_id": 6473, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1728560, "name": "Gerrie van Noord", "creator_id": 81856, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "commissioning agent", "role_id": 485, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "SP Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "142", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [53505], "external_references": []}, {"id": 67585, "acmi_id": "003778", "title": "Fishing the lake country", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fishing-the-lake-country", "creator_credit": "Betti Wood, Ossie Emery, ABC and Pilgrim Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;A Fisherman&#8217;s World&#8221;.<br />\nRon Calcutt shows some attractive fishing spots in Sydney and Mallacoota before going to the Gippsland Lakes.

Singer carefully introduces us into the labyrinth world of the X-men by following the plight of shy teenager, Marie D&#8217;Acanto (Anna Paquin), who discovers, much to her horror, that she has the power to absorb the life out of anyone she touches. Through her we meet Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a dangerous loner who, when provoked, protrudes steel blades out of his knuckles, as well as meeting the rest of the X-men who reside in a special school set up by the wheel chair bound and telepathic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Of course every super hero must have it&#8217;s villain, and a powerful foe is created in the mysterious and tormented Magnetto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has the ability to harness magnetic energy and wants to start a war between the intolerant humans and the mutants. Cast also includes Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos and Ray Park.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Statue of Liberty (New York, N.Y)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust survivors", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Closed captioning", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Discrimination", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Holocaust survivors", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Genetics", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust survivors", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Genetics", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Places&nbsp;→ Statue of Liberty (New York, N.Y)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960719, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960720, "name": "Lauren Shuler", "creator_id": 24277, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q469795", "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960721, "name": "Bryan Singer", "creator_id": 71327, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960718, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49969", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31983], "external_references": []}]}

By the mid-thirties, French cinema is enjoying a phase of expansion. Surprisingly, the influx of German personnel fleeing the Nazi regime helps expanding the market for French cinema into Eastern Europe. This is the time during which Pommer leaves UFA to work in Paris to produce &#8216;Liliom&#8217; with Fritz Lang. An other emigre is Pabst who directs &#8216;The Three Penny Opera&#8217;<em> and &#8216;L&#8217;Atlantide&#8217;, starring Brigitte Helm. Alexander Korda, brought to France by Pagnol to direct &#8216;Marius&#8217;</em> also directs &#8216;La dame de chez Maxim&#8217;s&#8217;, before returning to the UK. For most of the German emigres such as Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak, Anatole Litvak, Fritz lang, G. W. Pabst, France was only a stop over on their way to real careers and prospects in Hollywood.

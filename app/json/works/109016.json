Chromos, like any beautiful design, invites contemplation, so rather than try to identify the mathematical rules at play, most viewers will happily lose themselves in the entrancing visual maze. The work engages aspects of behavioural and cognitive theories and theories of creativity. The human brain has evolved to seek meaning and so many viewers of cellular automata believe they are witnessing a much higher degree of intelligence and lifelike-ness than is implicit in the system itself.

The war with all it&#8217;s horrors had a profound effect on McCrae along with the death of a close soldier friend; he penned his most famous poem after his friend&#8217;s death. McCrae was never the same after leaving the front, his health failed and he died in 1918 without knowing the outcome of the war and was buried in France. This tribute to his life and work will make people remember his life and work and to think about the poem that meant so much to the people who fought and died in that awful war.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "People&nbsp;→ McCrae, John 1872-1918", "Places&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427660, "name": "Robert Duncan", "creator_id": 76023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427659, "name": "Barbara Shearer", "creator_id": 78498, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427658, "name": "Jonathon Desbarats", "creator_id": 78497, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427657, "name": "International Documentary Television Corporation", "creator_id": 78496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427656, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 86050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427655, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43792", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26848], "external_references": []}]}

Hsieh&#8217;s work consists of five &#8216;One Year Performances&#8217; executed between the years of 1978 and 1886 and &#8216;Earth&#8217; a thirteen year performance that stretched from the end of 1986 to the end of 1999. Each of these Performances involved a particular vow, a particular constraint, a particular mode of being. Each of them is meticulously documented in a manner appropriate to its content. Each of Hsieh&#8217;s performances was a singular event: an action, or a series of actions, that occurred in a designated place during a finite period of time. Although Hsieh never explicitly states the rationale for his one-year pieces they nonetheless resound with profound questions about life, art and being. In one sense, the Hsieh&#8217;s life work is an endeavour to make art and life collide.The performances themselves are as weird as they are wonderful intersecting with a diverse range of themes such as isolation, solitude, displacement, human relationships and artistic documentation. The first of the One Year Performances had the artist lock himself inside a cage for an entire year. The second One Year Performance, saw the artist punch a time clock, every hour on the hour, twenty-four hours a day for a whole year.

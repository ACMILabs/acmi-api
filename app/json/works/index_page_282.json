Not surprising then that Julia Stiles stars in this latest twist on Shakespeare&#8217;s classic opposites-attract tale, &#8220;The Taming of the shrew&#8221;. &#8220;10 things I hate about you&#8221; sticks to the original story quite closely, mostly foregoing the flowery Elizabethan dialogue for a more appropriate teen slang. Otherwise the story set up is the same, the sweet natured Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is in love with Cameron (Joseph Gorden-Levitt) but is forbidden to date by her paranoid father unless she finds her older sister a boyfriend. Unfortunately her sister Kate (Julia Stiles) is an ill-tempered shrew whose manner towards men is hostile to say the least. Enter mysterious bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger), who is enlisted by the desperate lovers to win over the impenetrable Kate.

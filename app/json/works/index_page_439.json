Planet Usher&#8217;s aural and visual aesthetic is low-tech high fidelity, evocatively rendering the degradation of memory, and more especially, of the physical senses as they are affected by Usher Syndrome. Finally, this project attempts to overlay the twin spaces and soundscapes of the domestic sphere and the metaphorical planet, thereby making the familiar alien, and the alien familiar.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ People with disabilities", "Multimedia"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2464892, "name": "Patrick Tarrant", "creator_id": 9153, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2439", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [48586]}, {"id": 88303, "acmi_id": "310858", "title": "Planet ocean", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "planet-ocean", "creator_credit": "Planet Ocean", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Tamara Rewse, a self confessed avid stamp collector explores the unknown depths of the ocean, coming across creatures such as sharks, dolphins and manta rays, which co-incidentally can also be found in Australia Post&#8217;s Planet Ocean series of stamps.

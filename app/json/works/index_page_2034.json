With Kate unwell, George asks that Ellen return home as carer - a role which Ellen resents, as it will take her away from her boyfriend and literary career in New York. &#8220;One true thing&#8221;, a high-brow tearjerker, utilises melodrama to portray the central conflict of the family that is always subtly at war with itself. At times turgid and predictable the drama is nevertheless effective, mostly due to the strong performances of the three lead actors as they portray adults bourgeoning with thwarted desires and misplaced loyalties. Cast includes Meryl Streep, Renee Zelweger and William Hurt.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:02:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961980, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961981, "name": "Monarch Pictures", "creator_id": 80211, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961982, "name": "Ufland Productions", "creator_id": 80212, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961983, "name": "Jesse Beaton", "creator_id": 80213, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961984, "name": "Harry Ufland", "creator_id": 80214, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961985, "name": "Carl Franklin", "creator_id": 80215, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961979, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50831", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [32792]}, {"id": 89596, "acmi_id": "312408", "title": "One trick pony", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "one-trick-pony", "creator_credit": "Warner Bros Pictures, Michael Hausman, Michael Tannen and Robert Young", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Paul Simon used his own knowledge and experience of the rock music industry in writing the script to &#8220;One Trick Pony&#8221;.

It is the story of the Heidelberg School of artists, written by Bill Garner and based on an original idea by Humphrey McQueen. Episode one begins with Tom Roberts, painter and photographer, born in Dorset, England in 1856. Tom Roberts arrived in Geelong in 1869 and settled in Collingwood (Melbourne) where he became a member of the Victorian Academy of Arts. The Academy was conservative and frowned upon the idea of &#8220;Australian&#8221; art, professional women artists or the new form of Impressionism. As an artist Tom Roberts became obsessed with painting the bush landscape; Jane Sutherland wanted equal rights for women artists - together and along with several other Melbourne artists including Fred McCubbin, Clara Southern, Arthur Streeton, all members of the Academy, a breakaway group was formed and became known as the Australian Artists Association.

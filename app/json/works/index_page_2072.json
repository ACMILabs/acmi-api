Told through the eyes and words of a freelance videographer, we follow Mardar (Jia Hongsheng) a motor-cycle courier in his mid-twenties who does his pick-ups and deliveries, no questions asked. However, when Mardar finds himself delivering Moudan (Zhou Xun), the 16 year-old daughter of an alcoholic smuggler, to her aunt, he has no idea what is in store for him. A tender loving relationship soon forms between the two only to be put to the test when Mardar is persuaded by his shady associates to kidnap Moudan and hold her to ransom. Moudan, heartbroken and betrayed, makes her escape vowing to Mardar before jumping off the bridge into the murky depths of the Suzhou River, that she will come back as a mermaid to haunt him. Accused of Moudan&#8217;s murder, Mardar spends a few years in prison until his release, when grief-stricken and distraught, he sets out to find his beloved Moudan. When he encounters Meimei (Zhou Xun), a nightclub dancer who performs in an aquarium as a mermaid and who bears a striking resemblance to Moudan, Mardar becomes totally obsessed in the belief that Meimei is his lost love, Moudan.

Legend goes that the ancient school was once the residence of a witches coven, headed by an evil and powerful black witch named Mater Suspiriorum (Black Widow). When a series of grisly murders begin to occur at the ballet school, Susy begins to suspect that witchcraft may be involved. Working at the height of his creative powers (following the box office success of 1975&#8217;s &#8216;Deep Red&#8217;) Argento raises the level of terror with his trademark blood soaked set pieces by using vibrant colour film stock, abrupt editing, multi-layered sound scapes (including the techno-rock Goblin score) and rapid camera movement. Cast also includes Alida Valli, Udo Kier, Stefania Casini, Joan Bennett, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bose, Barbara Magnolfi and Susanna Javicoli.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Germany", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Occultism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witchcraft", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Places&nbsp;→ Germany"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957745, "name": "La Seda", "creator_id": 30848, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957746, "name": "Claudio Argento", "creator_id": 1530, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957747, "name": "Dario Argento", "creator_id": 1456, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45880", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [28395]}, {"id": 89777, "acmi_id": "312650", "title": "Suspicion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "suspicion", "creator_credit": "RKO Radio Pictures and Alfred Hitchcock", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1941", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1941-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A dowdy and repressed young woman, a colonel&#8217;s daughter who has led a sheltered life, is irresistibly attracted to a man who is romantic and reckless, a rejection of everything her family background and upbringing have stood for.

Terence Stamp is unforgettable as the transsexual Bernice and the loving relationship that develops between Stamp and Bill Hunter&#8217;s outback &#8220;bloke&#8221; is very tender and very touching. Full of humour, colour and bizarre costumes for which the film won an Academy Award, &#8220;Priscilla&#8221; is a wickedly entrancing family movie which shows that not only Australian cities but the mythical Australian bush has been affected and changed by ethnic and sexual multiculturalism. The soundtrack is full of great drag disco classics from &#8220;I Will Survive&#8221; and &#8220;Go West&#8221; to the more recent &#8220;Finally&#8221; and &#8220;Save the Best for Last.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Abba (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Disco dancing"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Captioned"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 904836, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 904835, "name": "Michael Hamlyn", "creator_id": 732, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 904834, "name": "Al Clark", "creator_id": 731, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 904833, "name": "Specific Films", "creator_id": 26836, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 904832, "name": "Latent Image", "creator_id": 26835, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 904831, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41645", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [25132]}]}

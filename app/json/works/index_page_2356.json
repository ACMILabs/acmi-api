Emphasising family participation, this video shows owners how to teach their puppy basic obedience commands such as &#8220;come&#8221;, &#8220;sit&#8221;, &#8220;heel&#8221;, and &#8220;stay&#8221;. Through daily handling and calming exercises, your puppy can also be taught to overcome biting, barking, and housetraining behavioural problems. The aim of the video is to train dogs to be good companions and a joy to live with.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dogs - Training", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Puppies", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Dogs - Training"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 901655, "name": "Bluford-Toth Productions", "creator_id": 24535, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 901656, "name": "Martin Bluford", "creator_id": 77121, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 901657, "name": "Beth M Toth", "creator_id": 77122, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 901654, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38199", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [21798], "external_references": []}, {"id": 96287, "acmi_id": "503508", "title": "Sirene", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sirene", "creator_credit": "Raoul Servais", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Belgium, 1970", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Animated satire on present-day commercial life.

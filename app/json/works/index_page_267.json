Told largely in flashback, the film details Friese-Greene&#8217;s tireless experimentation with the moving-image which mostly ended in failure and which eventually cost him his family and his reputation. The legitimacy of the claims for Friese-Greene became a central issue in the criticism of the film. Made for the 1951 Festival of Britain, &#8216;The Magic Box&#8217; features Robert Donat in the lead role and a huge supporting cast including such British film luminaries as Joyce Grenfell, Miles Malleson, Michael Redgrave, Eric Portman, Emlyn Williams, Richard Attenborough, Peter Ustinov, Cecil Parker, Kay Walsh, and Laurence Olivier.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography - History", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Inventors", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-magic-box", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1994664, "name": "Richard Best", "creator_id": 79363, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994661, "name": "John Boulting", "creator_id": 16070, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994660, "name": "Ronald Neame", "creator_id": 17038, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q460090", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994659, "name": "Festival Film Production", "creator_id": 32205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1994665, "name": "William Alwyn", "creator_id": 74656, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1994663, "name": "Jack Cardiff", "creator_id": 43634, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q436704", "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1994662, "name": "Eric Ambler", "creator_id": 9672, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q508452", "role": "screenwriter", "role_id": 601, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1994658, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47726", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1951", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1951"}], "labels": [29974], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90483, "acmi_id": "313451", "title": "Private Benjamin", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "private-benjamin", "creator_credit": "Howard Zieff, Harvey Miller, Charles Shyer, Nancy Meyers and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Private Benjamin is a pampered upper-middle-class Judy Benjamin, widowed on her wedding night.

It also inspired a series of horror films set around commemorative and public holidays (Mothers day, My bloody valentine, April fool&#8217;s day, Silent night, deadly night etc..) and launched the careers of Kevin Bacon and horror make-up artist Tom Savini. This however is where all the slasher rules and cliches began. Starting off in 1958, two teenage camp counselors are brutally murdered by an unknown assailant at Camp Crystal lake. Flashing forward 20 years on and a new group of counselors have ascended onto the camp, affectionately dubbed by the wary locals as &#8216;Camp blood&#8217;. Soon enough the body count begins to pile up as the horny teens get dispatched in various gruesome scenarios, all the while ignoring the blatent signs that this is not a good place to be.

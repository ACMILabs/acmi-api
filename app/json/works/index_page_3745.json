Based on a novel by the Czech writer Vladimir Vancura, &#8216;Capricious Summer&#8217; displays the subtle atmosphere of a Jean Renoir film. A film of the Czech New Wave&#8212;an highly fertile period in Czech film history that was brutally repressed by the Soviet invasion in 1968. Cast includes Rudolf Hrusinsky, Vlastimil Brodsky, Frantisek Rehak, Mila Myslikova and Jiri Menzel as the aerialist/magician.

Their lives should be joyously complete, but one day, Geoff and the baby mysteriously disappear, leaving Bunnie devastated. Years later, in the 1990s, Bunnie accepts help from Cassandra, a young woman who claims to be a clairvoyant, to find out what has become of her child. Cassandra brings the couple back together again to solve the mystery of what really happened.

Four main steps are recommended. One: empower yourself. This step is directed as managers/supervisors/team leaders; if managers behave like victims, externalising all their problems (i.e. blaming everyone and everything else) then staff will follow suit. Two: Demonstrate empowerment. For managers this means to accept responsibility for problems and go about fixing them your self. Three: give management guarantees that you (i.e. the employee) will implement suggestions.

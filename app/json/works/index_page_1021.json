The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

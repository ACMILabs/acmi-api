The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes from a trip around Phillip Island in South West Gippsland, Victoria. There are many views of the beaches, rolling waves, rocks, cliffs and sand dunes. Wallace captures people strolling along the beaches and fishing from the sand with long rods, koalas and seabirds. There are some farm scenes, of children helping throw hay to cows from the back of a &#8216;ute&#8217; vehicle.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:02:41:00 seabird snuggling in nest.<br />\n00:03:41:00 a koala up close and perched in a eucalypt tree.<br />\n00:05:26:00 visitors to the beach sitting for a chat<br />\n00:07:29:00 fishing from sand, framed by rocks<br />\n00:09:25:00 hay being distributed from a &#8216;ute&#8217; (utility vehicle)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 16]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, c. 1970s</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur cinematographer and filmmaker during the 1960s to the 1990s.

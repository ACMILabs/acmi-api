This documentary records the celebration of the first Aboriginal Arts in Perth 83 festival which attracted participants from all over Australia, including Maureen Watson, Jack Davis and Vic Hunter. Traditional dance, song and story-telling were a feature and interaction with the audience was encouraged - a way of sharing the Aboriginal culture with non-Aboriginal Australians. The film also documents Aboriginal community members from the Mowanjum Community in Derby, WA and the Warmun Community in Turkey Creek, WA, visiting schools in Perth, teaching the school-children about Aboriginal culture and traditions in an effort to improve race relations and bridge the gap of understanding between all Australians.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australian singers", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Attitudes", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Children", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Dances", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Education", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Rites and ceremonies", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social life and customs", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Urban residence", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Western Australia", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Art, Aboriginal Australian", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Songs, Aboriginal Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Festivals - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Painting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Aboriginal Australian", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Literature&nbsp;→ Davis, Jack, 1917-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australian singers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Dances", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Songs, Aboriginal Australian", "People&nbsp;→ Davis, Jack, 1917-", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1928647, "name": "David Noakes", "creator_id": 21557, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1928646, "name": "Bryan McLellan", "creator_id": 79759, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1928645, "name": "W A Filmworkers", "creator_id": 33475, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1928644, "name": "I F Productions", "creator_id": 33474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1928643, "name": "AFI [au]", "creator_id": 9711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49718", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [31778], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92284, "acmi_id": "315515", "title": "No problems", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "no-problems-a", "creator_credit": "Jackie McKimmie, Queensland Film Development Office and Australian Film Commission", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Mercy Steele remembers her childhood in Lowmead, Queensland in the 1920&#8217;s.

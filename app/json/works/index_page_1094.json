Moving from one brutal encounter to another, Alex eventually discovers the real killer leaving a body count and bloody trail behind him. Relentlessly and gratuitously violent, this is the third instalment in the million dollar Crow franchise that hit the big screen in 1994, directed by Alex Proyas and starring Brandon Lee in his ill fated last screen performance. Cast also includes William Atherton, Grant Shaud and Jodi Lyn O&#8217;Keefe.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963749, "name": "Bharat Nalluri", "creator_id": 36190, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963748, "name": "Jeff Most", "creator_id": 78353, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963747, "name": "Edward Pressman", "creator_id": 23171, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963746, "name": "IMF Internationale Medien und Film GmbH & Co.

Spoken in French with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>An upbeat and entertaining film from director Gerard Pires where the tale of charismatic and grandiose Daniel, a former pizza delivery boy turned taxi driver extraodinaire, is woven into the tragi-comic life of Emilien, an unsuccessful, down trodden policeman on a near hopeless search for illusive German bank robbers. The son of a rally car driver, with driving skills that seemingly defy the realms of possibility with his speed crazy efforts in a custom modified car brimming with gadgetry, Daniel unsuspectingly picks up Emilien from his mother&#8217;s house and inevitably sets out to give him a high-speed ride. Consequently, Daniel is forced to accept a deal as a driver and assistant detective for Emilien to avoid becoming a permanent pedestrian. So, from stages of ineptitude and absurdity the investigation into the German bank robbers continues but this time with Daniel uncomfortably placed on the other side of the law but nevertheless becoming a crucial mastermind along with Emilien in the pursuit of the bank robbers. With the help of a parade of pizza delivery boys, Daniel&#8217;s trusty taxi, the amiably long suffering women in both their lives and a little messing with envious egos the unlikely pair take the uncrackable case to its longed for conclusion. Cast includes Samy Naceri, Frederic Diefenthal, Marion Cotillard and Manuella Gourary.

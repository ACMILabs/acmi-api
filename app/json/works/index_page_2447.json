A successful but angst ridden German art critic, established in London, is contacted by a student friend from the 1960s to assassinate a Chilean military torturer. Approaching a comfortable middle age, he is unsettled by the disruption which forces him to confront his political convictions and choose between the activism of his youth or the complacency and security of his present life. Filmed on location in London and Hamburg.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Colin McCabe ; director, Andi Engel ; writer, Andi Engel, Lewis Rodia ; phototography, Denis Crossan ; editing, Christopher Roth ; music, Simon Fisher Turner.<br />\nCast: Jeroen Krabbe, Susannah York, Ulrich Wildgruber, Kate Hardie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Chile - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Students - Political activity", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Europe - Politics and government - 20th century"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889348, "name": "BFI", "creator_id": 68434, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889349, "name": "Colin MacCabe", "creator_id": 79646, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889350, "name": "Andi Engel", "creator_id": 82185, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146295", "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}, {"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [55152]}, {"id": 84910, "acmi_id": "306252", "title": "Mela's lunch", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "melas-lunch", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Penny Ritco, Wolf Koenig and Sugith Varughese", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1991", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Playing Fair&#8221;.<br />\nMela has just immigrated from India to Canada and is trying to settle into a new environment.

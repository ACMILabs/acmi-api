Travelling with Happy, they come across a strange fruit that Happy eats. Arktos&#8217; number one henchman James is also interested in the fruit and takes it back to his master. The next day, both Arktos and Happy suffer from a sleeping sickness. &#8220;The Big cloud&#8221; (story by Gregor Rottschalk, Heike Lage): Snowballs packed with a secret formula that turns them into thick, black clouds are assailing Greenland. Counteracting the power will require activating the molten lava in the volcano through the assistance of an army of special ants. &#8220;The Visitors who came in from the cold&#8221; (story by Gregor Rottschalk): Productivity is down at Arktos&#8217; sardine factory and there is a mass walkout by penguin staff, including their brethren working throughout the rest of Ice World.

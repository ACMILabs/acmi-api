Newly appointed as acting mayor of the Yingzhou city, Xiao announced that he would do ten good things for the city at his inauguration. He encouraged the local peasants to build a bridge through self-financing, and he lent his support to the director of Baiyun Pharmaceutical Factory in terms of promoting a blacklisted engineer, Li Huaxin. Xiao also helped Li Huaxin’s daughter, who was not allowed to go abroad to study because of her father’s background. As an acting mayor, Xiao made some achievements but also aroused controversy.

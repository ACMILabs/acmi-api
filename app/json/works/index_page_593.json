In 1996 was when we affiliated with the Omeo and District Football League. We ‘ad the Seniors an’ the Juniors, we ‘ad the Junior Netball all the way through to the Senior Netball for the girls, we drafted quite a few players from other Clubs around the East Gippie an’ the Omeo League as well…there were Kooris playing in but they wished to play for Lake Tyers. I coached the Juniors in ’96 to the Grand Final. The following year I coached the Seniors to the Grand Final as well. The moral of Lake Tyers lifted through sport, kids were attending school on a regular basis, the health issues at Lake Tyers lifted an’ the Elders had somewhere to go on Saturdays where they could sit there an’ watch the boys and girls play Netball an’ Football. During those two years some of our issues were some of the players we drafted from other areas became angry on the ground. It sort of sounded like as if they wanted to be black versus white. During my coaching of those years I tried to talk to players not to be like that, that it wasn’t a racial issue. The other thing was, there was only probably four to six people running a Football Club, which wasn’t enough numbers to run a Football Club.</p>\n<p>Got time…got time…Pass…pass…pass…play on…go…go…go…</p>\n<p>When we were asked to leave the Omeo League, the moral of Lake Tyers went backwards.

And go back yourself and just have a go.</p>\n<p>[PLAYER TALKING TO TEAM IN LOCKER ROOM]</p>\n<p>Basically doing the same things I was doing when I was 15 or 16. Just try and get in front and lead hard and try and get the ball. And you know, I can&#8217;t kick any further than 40 meters. I never could. And start in the 10-yard square, and soon as you see an opening, just go. And if they deliberately hit you on the chest, well and good. You&#8217;ll get it for yourself.</p>\n<p>BEV ALBERT: I have nagged at times. But my main worry is injury. I worry that he might have an injury that&#8217;s not going to get better. That&#8217;s my basic concern, really. It&#8217;s the only reason why I&#8217;d like him to stop. But still, he wants to keep going, so if that makes him happy, it makes me happy.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s getting the side out on the ground and just enjoying the game the footy. Helping one another out. That&#8217;s most of it, I think.</p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s a few blokes playing in the seconds that say, well, Slippery&#8217;s still playing? Well, I&#8217;ll keep playing meself.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re a long time retired.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

That&#8217;s the way I looked at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT: Fizz was always on the side of the bloke that hit second, because he thought the bloke that hit second had a reason to hit. So the bloke that hit first was always in trouble with Fizz. Never be the instigator, but it was OK to be the retaliater.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Fizz was one of the very first of the idea of just get the play going, you know? If there was biffo or something happening, Fizz wasn&#8217;t going to run in and try and be authoritarian. He&#8217;d just throw the ball up, or bounce the ball, and just get on with it, you know? And if there was 10 blokes belting the heebie-jeebies out of each other down the road, well, eventually they&#8217;d stop, because the footy&#8217;d come into their area. And that was a&#8212; and it was a great philosophy, and a lot of blokes sort of&#8212; I suppose he&#8217;s a pioneer in that area, of getting the game going.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  You&#8217;ve got to be fit. You&#8217;ve got to try very hard to make yourself fit. And I was happy to be ready to play. And you main thing, I&#8217;ve found, is to get in position. Make sure you&#8217;ve got in position. And make the effort to get in position would make it a lot easier. And the players, if you&#8217;ve done that, you&#8217;ve got a lot more respect back. That&#8217;s the way I look at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I enjoyed every bit of what I done. Use to just look for Saturday.

And I&#8217;m not being derogative to our boys, but we just haven&#8217;t got the overall talent and the numbers of talented players to win a flag.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>All Central Murray clubs would be spending, at the moment&#8212; the majority of them, anyway, the successful ones, say, 6 or 8 of the top 12, would spend in excess of $100,000 a year on players alone.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>GRAHAM &#8220;JOCK&#8221; CAMPBELL:  It&#8217;s not unreasonable to pay players, $700, $800, $900, or $1,000 a game to be competitive. I have contributed large sums of money. But we&#8217;ve certainly done our homework. We&#8217;ve gone around metro Melbourne and Mildura and hand-picked the players that we reckoned wood do the job.</p>\n<p>[PLAYERS SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>MERV NEAGLE:  I think after the &#8216;94 Premiership, this club won 14 games in 10 years. You know, I mean, and you get sick of it. You don&#8217;t want to go along and the players get sick of it. The all the supporters get sick of it.</p>\n<p>So when all of a sudden, they decided, OK let&#8217;s have another crack at it, it&#8217;s just like a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? OK, we&#8217;ve got a good side. We&#8217;re going to win. Let&#8217;s go to the footy.</p>\n<p>And the whole town on a Saturday when the team plays away&#8212; like we went to Tooleybuc on Saturday. You could have fired a gun up the Main Street of this town and you wouldn&#8217;t have hit anyone. There&#8217;s just a different hype around the place when your football side&#8217;s winning. That&#8217;s how important it is to the town, you know?</p>\n<p>So at the moment, all&#8217;s&#8212; well, we were runners-up last year. And hopefully we have a side good enough to go one step better this year.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>ROB BARRETT: A lot of people don&#8217;t like what we do. And I mean, that&#8217;s the jealousy thing comes into it. And yeah, each time that we&#8217;ve one a premiership, there&#8217;s been money involved. So you do tend to get that. Oh, well, they bought a premiership. Yeah, there&#8217;s a fair bit of feeling comes about. I mean, yeah, you talk about these country teams and country footy clubs, money&#8217;s a big thing.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration",

Mallee stump. The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling. It always has been. And yeah, always will be.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Because we didn&#8217;t have any social club rooms at the time to store any of our memorabilia, everything was stored at the pub. And as different publicans come and go, some don&#8217;t like the memorabilia that apparently collects dust, and so he decided he&#8217;d clean the place out. And I went past one day and he was heading out to the tip with all of this football memorabilia in the back of his Ute.</p>\n<p>And so I quickly went in and grabbed the lot. And I&#8217;ve still got a fair bit of it, but it&#8217;s all there for the football club, for the future. And it&#8217;s interesting how some people just don&#8217;t value these things that others really think are fairly precious.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I just think, mainly because of where we live, in the middle of the Mallee, it was called the Mallee Footy League, and we end up with a trophy made out of a Mallee stump, you can&#8217;t get much more significant than that. And to remember a premiership in the town for a standalone team at the time, I think it&#8217;s pretty magic, the way it&#8217;s been remembered.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The perfect Mallee trophy</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Malcolm McKinnon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>VIC/Australia, 2007</p>", "description": "<p>Underbool&#8217;s triumph in the 1975 Mallee Football League Grand Final is commemorated with a peculiar and truly unique trophy.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Chris Brown.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>CHRIS BROWN:  Given that we&#8217;re the Mallee Football League, the perfect thing to make any trophies out of would have to be the Mallee stump.

The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling.

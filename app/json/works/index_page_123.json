The film was carefully marketed as an &#8216;Australian&#8217; production, despite Powell&#8217;s presence as producer-director, his British director of photography, and a screenplay by his regular collaborator in England, Emeric Pressburger (using the pseudonym Richard Imrie). Based on the book by Nino Culotta (John O&#8217;Grady). Cast includes Walter Cohiari, Clare Dunne, Chips Rafferty, Ed Devereaux, John Meillion and Tony Bonner.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:41:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["G", "Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italians - Australia", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Italians - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1313502, "name": "Michael Powell", "creator_id": 21924, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1313501, "name": "Williamson-Powell Productions", "creator_id": 21923, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1313505, "name": "Tony Bonner", "creator_id": 76457, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1313504, "name": "Ed Devereaux", "creator_id": 76456, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1313503, "name": "Chips Rafferty", "creator_id": 75005, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1313500, "name": "Video Classroom", "creator_id": 20016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35224", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1966", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1966"}], "labels": [18902]}, {"id": 119720, "acmi_id": "324048", "title": "Mystery at castle house", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mystery-at-castle-house", "creator_credit": "Peter Maxwell, Brendon Lunney and Independent Productions (AU)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Spider, an adventurous 12 year old, takes his new friends, Ben and Kate, across the harbour to a deserted old mansion, Castle House.

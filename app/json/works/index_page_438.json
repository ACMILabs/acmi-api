Exploiting Melies&#8217; mastery of film magic, this early cinema classic explores a vast range of fantasy landscapes. The travellers breach space and time as they travel, using every imaginable means of transportation, from one space and place to another in the attempt to geographically explore the earth and the surrounding space. This extraordinary science fiction fantasy was only one of the many pioneering films made by Melies in the early 1900s and it, like his other films, combines whimsical humour with wild imaginative journeys.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travelers", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "History&nbsp;→ Adventure and adventurers", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - France"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2519608, "name": "Georges Melies", "creator_id": 7067, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034641", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2519607, "name": "Georges Melies", "creator_id": 7067, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034641", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114005, "acmi_id": "B2000294", "title": "Georges Melies compilation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "georges-melies-compilation", "creator_credit": "Georges Melies", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "1902-1907", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 603, "acmi_id": "B1001895", "title": "Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-trip-to-the-moon-le-voyage-dans-la-lune", "creator_credit": "Georges Melies", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1902", "video_links": [{"id": 3091, "name": "Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon)", "uri": "https://youtu.be/9I-xH84-M6A"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1902-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 114004, "acmi_id": "B1004320", "title": "L'Eclipse du Soleil en Pleine Lune", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "leclipse-du-soleil-en-pleine-lune", "creator_credit": "Georges Melies", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1907", "video_links": [{"id": 3100, "name": "L'Eclipse du Soleil en Pleine Lune", "uri": "https://youtu.be/b5dkLf0bGYI"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1907-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "795", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1904", "notes": "", "to_year": "1904"}], "labels": [53500]}, {"id": 122462, "acmi_id": "Z000207", "title": "Minyak Sawit Keluarga (Palm Oil Family)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "minyak-sawit-keluarga-palm-oil-family", "creator_credit": "Olivia Koh", "credit_line": "<p>Commissioned by Hyphenated Projects and ACMI</p>", "headline_credit": "2023", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 5", "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2023-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": true, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Minyak Sawit Keluarga (Palm Oil Family) by artist Olivia Koh, examines her paternal family’s history of farming practices in rural Southern Malaysia (Peninsula).

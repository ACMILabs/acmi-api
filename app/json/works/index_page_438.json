Under the guidance of Bagheera and the laid-back bear Baloo, Mowgli adventures through the jungle to discover friendship, loyalty and his place in the world, while meeting a fabulous cast of friends and foes.</p>\n<p><I>The Jungle Book</i> (1967), Walt Disney Animation Studio’s classic musical adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s beloved book, has been an animated favourite for over 50 years and features the voice talents of some of the biggest stars of the day, as well as gorgeous animation, classic characters and iconic music and songs from the Sherman Brothers and Terry Gilkyson. </p>\n<p>Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston supervised the animation for Mowgli and Baloo, who feature in the above sketch. The contrasting size and movements of the young boy and easy-going bear balance one another throughout the film. In the lively musical sequence the “Bare Necessities”, Mowgli appears clumsy and a little unsure while the wise Baloo dances gracefully to the rhythm of the accompanying jazz music, all the while showing Mowgli the ways of the jungle.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Disney Studio Artist </p>\n<p>Story Sketch </p>\n<p>Conte crayon, marker, and ink on paper</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Conte crayon, marker, and ink on paper"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 82336}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-jungle-book", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1986819, "name": "Wolfgang Reitherman", "creator_id": 75872, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986818, "name": "Walt Disney", "creator_id": 68785, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986817, "name": "Walt Disney Productions", "creator_id": 72131, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1986816, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38977", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [22561], "external_references": []}, {"id": 83066, "acmi_id": "304250", "title": "Death in Venice", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "death-in-venice", "creator_credit": "Luchino Visconti and Alfa Cinematografica", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Gustav Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is a distinguished man, a world-famous conductor who embodies all the civilised virtues of the European culture he represents.

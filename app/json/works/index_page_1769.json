The next patient is a delusional young girl (Charlotte Rampling) who has a split personality &#8216;Lucy&#8217; (Britt Ekland) upon who she blames the murder of her brother and nurse. The final patient used to be a doctor and makes creepy robot models that have fully functioning brains and murderous intentions. Scary fun stuff with appropriate orchestral music to make sure you know when something weird is about to happen and the final twist reveals just who is Dr Starr.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychologists", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychotherapy patients", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/asylum-1972-0", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2102275, "name": "Roy Baker", "creator_id": 16925, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q711178", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102272, "name": "Max J Rosenberg", "creator_id": 17156, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6795186", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102274, "name": "Milton Subotsky", "creator_id": 78117, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6861467", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102270, "name": "Amicus Productions", "creator_id": 34434, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q470851", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2102269, "name": "Harbour productions", "creator_id": 34888, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126447", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2102268, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53259", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [34703]}]}

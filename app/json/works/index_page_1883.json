Cheng Zhaoxun, You Zongshu use cinematography to construct Yi as a complex character. Shots of Yi’s face begin in close up to emphasise the emotion and then zoom out gradually to offer context.

Hua politely evades Ma’s advances and retreats behind a curtain to change. Ma peers through the curtain, telling her that he has paid and expects favours in return. When Hua’s husband Jin Lingtong tells Ma that they sell their art, but not their bodies, Ma redirects his derision, insisting that Jin must perform songs at his request.

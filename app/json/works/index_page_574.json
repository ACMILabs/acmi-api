Most films were shot by aspiring filmmaker John Christofi Pallaris, while some are credited to Reg Robinson.</p>\n<p>Moomba Festival held its inaugural event through the streets and parks of Melbourne on 12 March 1955. The festival was designed as a cultural public event for the city, incorporating a street parade, a carnival and an outdoor art show, among other festivities. Throughout the 1950s to 1970s the grand parade down Swanston Street was at its peak, attracting crowds of hundreds of thousands of people and featuring a stream of decorated floats on flat-bed trucks advertising businesses and community groups, accompanied by marching bands, celebrities, clowns, and performers on stilts. The crowning of Monarch royals who lead the parade has been a tradition since 1955.</p>\n<p>This 16mm film shows footage of the 1967 Moomba parade, filmed from the intersection of Victoria and Swanston Street at the top end of the city. The photographer captures stunning colour footage of the parade as it rounds the corner leading through the city to the Shrine of Remembrance, with crowds of onlookers lining the streets.</p>\n<p>The parade is led by a marching band, the inaugural King of Moomba Robert Morley, and the Queen of Moomba, Patsy Earp, on a large, swan-shaped float.

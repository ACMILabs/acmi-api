While her husband was still in good favour with the revolutionary army, she was the vice-director of the woman&#8217;s liberation group. As well as losing her husband, all her possessions had been confiscated and she is left to raise her eight year old son, Yang-Yang, in the poor outskirts of the city. The narrative is centred on the relationship between mother and son, who are faced with the hardships and poverty of life in China. Luo Li-Ping, a local postman, develops a close relationship with the mother and son; he quietly supports and takes care of them throughout the years (we see the passage of time through the maturation of Yang-Yang). Ten years later, after the death of Mao, Zhang Wei-Ming&#8217;s name is cleared; it is revealed that he was a victim of the &#8220;Gang of Four&#8221;. With that, Liang-Hui and Yang-Yang&#8217;s former rights and privileges are restored. The pair&#8217;s prosperity and social status convinces Luo that he is no longer needed, so he stays away. His absence is sorely felt by Liang-Hui, the distance makes her realise her love for him. Upon meeting again, each confesses their true feelings for the other, but they know that their love for each other will not be an easy one, many obstacles still lie ahead, for they are from vastly different social classes. Personal desires and social obligations are again at odds for the couple, what will they do?</p>\n<p>Historical Background:<br />\nChinese Civil War in 1949 The Chinese Civil War was fought between the Kuomintang (KMT or Chinese Nationalist Party) and the Communist Party of China (CPC). The war represented an ideological split between the Western-supported Nationalist KMT and the Soviet-supported Communist CPC. The civil war carried on intermittently until the Second Sino-Japanese War interrupted it, resulting in the two parties forming a Second United Front. Japan&#8217;s campaign was defeated in 1945, marking the end of World War II, and China&#8217;s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. After a further four years, 1950 saw a cessation of major hostilities—with the newly founded People&#8217;s Republic of China controlling mainland China, and the Republic of China&#8217;s jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan (and its surrounding islands). To this day, since no armistice has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.<br />\n&#8220;The Gang of Four&#8221; was the name given to a leftist political faction composed of four Chinese Communist Party officials who came into prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), and were subsequently charged with a series of treasonous crimes. The Gang of Four, together with disgraced Communist general Lin Biao, were labelled the two major &#8220;counter-revolutionary forces&#8221; of the Cultural Revolution and officially blamed for the worst excesses of the societal chaos that ensued during the ten years of turmoil. Their downfall in a coup d’état on October 6, 1976, a mere month after Mao&#8217;s death, brought about major celebrations on the streets of Beijing and marked the end of a turbulent political era in China.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nThe affective performances and the well constructed script give the narrative an extra dimension of complexity, effectively drawing out the emotions and internal conflicts faced by each of the characters, who are very much a product of a highly controlled and repressed society.<br />\nThe adult Yang-Yang asks his mother: &#8220;How did you and dad fall in love?&#8221;<br />\nLiang-Hui: &#8220;Love?

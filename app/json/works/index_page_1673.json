The film opens with Mona&#8217;s frozen body found lying in a ditch and proceeds to trace her story in a series of flashbacks to the point of her death. Bonnaire gives an impressive performance of the cold, and not completely likeable Mona, who remains distant to the people she meets and also the audience. Her distance intrigues on many levels. She talks of hoping to one day own a piece of land, and then later wishes to be the caretaker of a house.

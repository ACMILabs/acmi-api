This is a witty and inspiring story of inner strength and fortitude, John Hurt was named Best Actor of 1975 at the British Academy Awards for his performance, and Jack Gold won the Academy&#8217;s Desmond Davis Award for his creative contribution to television.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Crisp, Quentin", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783840, "name": "Jack Gold", "creator_id": 14953, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q543700", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1811786, "name": "Barry Hanson", "creator_id": 25256, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783838, "name": "Thames Television", "creator_id": 16565, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q541667", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 783837, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39838", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [23393]}, {"id": 97503, "acmi_id": "506386", "title": "The NABC's of basketball: the running game", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-nabcs-of-basketball-the-running-game", "creator_credit": "Sports Films and Talents", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1974", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Coach Bill Foster organises the break into four major areas: the rebound, outlet, filling the lanes and completion of the break.

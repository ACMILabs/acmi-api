An intricate drama of (f)lies, deceit and the just revenge of the cinematographer. One of Starewicz earlier films, possibly the very first cinematic treatment of insect fidelity. &#8216;Town Rat, Country Rat&#8217; (1926, 14 mins): Slapstick with undercurrent erotism, &#8216;The Country Rat&#8217; fondly reminisces about the sensual pleasures he experienced on his way to town. &#8216;The Mascot&#8217; (1934, 20 mins): The story revolves around a hand-made stuffed dog puppet who comes to life when the poor woman who is making him sews a teardrop inside his chest. She has a sick little girl who wants &#8220;an orange&#8221; more than anything- how times have changed. The dog goes through Hell to get the orange, fighting all sorts of weird demons, other puppets, and Satan himself! Finally winning in the end this small dose of vitamin C is all that is required to prevent a life dominated by an unrelenting bleak and threatening environment. &#8216;Love in Black and White&#8217; (1923-7, 22 mins): A curious racial rivalry between cupids and an exploration of promiscuity amongst vaudellians. Puppets are modelled on Charlie Chaplin, Tom Mix and Mary Pickford. &#8216;The Tale of the Fox&#8217; (1931, 65 mins): Starewicz&#8217; epic took over 10 years to finish. It is based on Goethe&#8217;s Reineke Fuchs, and film reviewers of the time said it was beyond any animated film ever attempted, in fact, it approached poetry.

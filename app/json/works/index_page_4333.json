Alice travels a bumpy road - no money, nowhere jobs and not much luck. She fights back with a spirited determination, which underscores this moving, often funny tale of one woman&#8217;s struggle for self-awareness and independence. With &#8216;Alice Doesn&#8217;t Live Here Anymore&#8217;, director Martin Scorsese shows that he is equally at home in semi-rural surroundings as he is in the asphalt jungle of &#8216;Taxi Driver&#8217;. The outstanding supporting cast includes Kris Kristofferson, Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952636, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "creator_id": 3485, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952635, "name": "Audrey Maas", "creator_id": 77657, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952634, "name": "David Susskind", "creator_id": 77656, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952633, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952632, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 17928, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/tKDz3LU132rof1PVonpPvRBLWtw.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Alice doesn't live here anymore (Martin Scorsese) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40529", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1974", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1974"}], "labels": [24064]}]}

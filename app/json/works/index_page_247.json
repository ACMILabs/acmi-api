With &#8220;Irreversible&#8221; (which includes a brief cameo from the lead character of &#8220;I stand alone&#8221;) Noe has upped the ante to an intense degree, making this one of the more distressing films you are likely to experience. Taking the very well used genre of the revenge film as a starting point, Noe defies expectations and delivers a remarkable aural and visual assault on the senses. Using mainly improvised dialogue, a disorientating camera style and depicting the film&#8217;s events backwards, &#8220;Irreversible&#8221; goes from an intense act of violence, to a horrendous rape (which plays out in excruciating real time) and finally to a quiet contemplative moment. The film&#8217;s peaceful coda leaves a bitter and devastating aftertaste as we are left to ponder the film&#8217;s final words, &#8216;time destroys everything&#8217;. Please note: contains scenes of violence which may disturb some viewers, and depicts explicit sexual relationships. Cast includes: Albert Dupontel, Jo Prestia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/irreversible", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999305, "name": "Gaspar Noe", "creator_id": 33480, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999304, "name": "Christophe Rossignon", "creator_id": 78491, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999303, "name": "Studio Canal", "creator_id": 31030, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999302, "name": "120 Films", "creator_id": 36331, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52278", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33877], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94370, "acmi_id": "318211", "title": "Divine intervention = Chronicle of love and pain [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "divine-intervention-chronicle-of-love-and-pain-dvd", "creator_credit": "Elia Suleiman, Joachim Ortmanns, Humbert Balsan, Lichtblick Filmproduktion, Soread 2M, Gimages, Arte France and Ognon Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Palestinian Territory, Occupied, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The winner of the International Critic&#8217;s Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, &#8220;Divine Intervention&#8221; is a black comedy that utilises absurdist and surrealistic conventions to represent the psychological and political consequences of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

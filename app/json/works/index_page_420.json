Director Alain Corneau cited Fritz Lang and American film noir as major influences for this film.

The soundtrack adds to the sense of realism, comprising the rumble of thunder and traffic, and incessant pop music from the radios which are found in almost every scene. Perec [the scriptwriter] has Frank speak a mixture of French backslang (le verlan) and street slang, combined with Anglicisms and spoonerisms.

Excess upstream water diversion and climate change have contributed to severe water scarcity and mass fish kills in recent years.</p>\n<p>In composing her shots of the river, Hirst references Australia’s beloved landscape painting tradition, and colonial-era artists like Eugene von Guérard, John Glover, Conrad Martens, Nicholas Chevalier, Ludwig Becker and of course, WC Piguenit. While their romantic paintings capture a sense of nature as awe inspiring, they also served the more material purpose of framing resources to be owned and exploited by European settlers, a visual expression of the concept of terra nullius.</p>\n<p>Darling Darling invites us to question the role played by Western visual art traditions in shaping the value systems that allow such an extreme environmental crisis to unfold right before our eyes.</p>\n<p>Gabriella Hirst (she/her) is an artist. She was born and grew up on Cammeraygal land (Australia) and is currently living between Berlin and London. She works primarily with moving image, performance, and with the garden as a site of critique and care.

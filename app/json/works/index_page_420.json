Reaffirming why he is considered &#8220;the best film actor of all time&#8221; (Chicago Sun-Times), Marlon Brando portrays a man torn apart by the suicide of his wife. His attempt to bury his grief in a sudden, purely carnal relationship with a strange girl (Maria Schneider) only twists the emotional noose tighter. In examining basic, conflicting human drives, director Bernardo Bertolucci lays bare the primal nature of man as no film has done before. &#8220;Last Tango in Paris&#8221; stands as one of Bertolucci&#8217;s finest achievements. Academy Award Nominations: Best Actor - Marlon Brando, Best Director - Bernardo Bertolucci.

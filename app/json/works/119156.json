Defending the attack, Israeli officials stated that Hamas was operating an intelligence cell out in the building yet AP executive editor Sally Buzbee has called for an independent inquiry into the strike stating that this attack destroyed the ability for news reporting in the territory vehemently fighting for the world’s right to know. “This is an important story and because of the actions yesterday, the world is going to know less.”</p>",

The game is played on a 72x84 hexagonal grid on which different units and squadrons, such as naval vessels and land based aircraft, are positioned. The player chooses actions for these units, the consequences for which are simulated by the computer. The game is quasi real-time, meaning that the game can be paused at any given moment at which time the player can give orders to the units. All interaction with the game is through a menu interface.

It is run entirely under the shadow of &#8220;Mother&#8221;, the family&#8217;s recently deceased matriarch who upheld stringency and regiment as the path to purity and well-being. Despite the contradictions, for example, that the patients never leave the hotel cured, the hotel&#8217;s staff run things as mother would have: Ronald, the son/chef, prepares food that resembles cardboard; Cora, the daughter/therapist, treats patients stringently; and Dezmond, the hotel&#8217;s manager and mummy&#8217;s dearest, ensures everyone follows suit. Director Terence Gross delights in the oddness of this enclosed world, creating a carnivalesque universe reminiscent of the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro.

As played by Charlton Heston (as the painter) and Rex Harrison (as the Pope), the men are both titanic egoists determined to leave eternity a unique vision of their love and faith for God. Though &#8220;the Agony and the Ecstasy&#8221; betrays an earlier era&#8217;s reluctance to deal with either Michelangelo&#8217;s ambivalent sexuality, or the Pope&#8217;s lustful material excesses, the emotionally violent duels between the men betray the deep extremes of hatred, jealousy and love which dominated their relationship. For a contemporary viewer it is the richly colourful cinematography and the epic reconstruction of Renaissance Rome which is the film&#8217;s long-lasting legacy. If the melodrama of the clashes between the tortured artist and the meglomaniac Pope now seem almost camp, the recreation of the feat of painting the vast Chapel still seems wondrous.

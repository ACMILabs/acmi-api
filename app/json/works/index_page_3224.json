Set in St Kilda, an groovy inner bayside suburb of Melbourne with its coffee set, quirky bars and cosmopolitan environs, the story revolves around eight &#8220;twenty-something&#8221; friends who live in the same apartment block sharing each other&#8217;s lives, loves, secrets and heartaches. Alex (Claudia Karvan) is struggling to get her life together, both in her career as a doctor and in her desire to find love whilst her flatmate Evan (Samuel Johnson) is a lovable, but frustrating would-be writer with a crazy sense of humour and who is not so much after love, but sex, in his life. Alex and Evan advertise for a new flatmate and into their lives enters Kelly (Deborah Mailman), the eternal optimist, childlike in her ways with a vulnerability almost begging to be exploited, but a personality neither Alex nor Evan can resist. Besides, Kelly is having trouble with her boyfriend/boss and she needs a place to live. Across the way there&#8217;s Will (Joel Edgerton), a down-to-earth scaffolder who shares a flat with Miranda (Abi Tucker) and Richie (Spencer McLaren), both actors and lovers in life and each with a particularly fragile ego. Upstairs live two aspiring lawyers, Gabrielle (Sibylla Budd), Alex&#8217;s best friend and swimming partner since they were eight year&#8217;s old, and Jason (Damian de Montemas), Gabrielle&#8217;s partner and husband-to-be. However, Alex and Gabrielle&#8217;s friendship is about to be blown apart when Gabrielle discovers &#8220;the unbelievable truth&#8221; between Alex and Jason. As for Will, love is not always easy to let go nor is the truth always easy to face, when girlfriend Leah asks him for a lend of a rather large sum of money. Whereas for Evan, the dichotomy is in how to get rid of a confronting demand for love and commitment by the obsessive Andrea - should he just tell her the truth? Kelly, being Kelly, opts for the truth and finally achieves her trifecta - a place to live, a job and a new love. Cast also includes David Tredinnick, Tasma Walton, Tempany Deckert, Jess Gower, Benjamin McNair and Catherine McClements.

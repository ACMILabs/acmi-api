The loss of childhood innocence is captured by powerful scenes of the boy hurling stones at the surrounding Israeli occupied territories following the death of his close friend by Israeli gunfire. Through Mohammed&#8217;s eyes are seen the crowding caused by illegal Israeli settlements, the use of neurological gas against civilians, the fallout caused by unexploded artillery, the constant influx of ambulance vehicles and hospital queues. Much of &#8220;Gaza Strip&#8221; unfolds through gripping and powerful images without the use of lengthy interviews or a political dialogue, but rather startling audiovisual bites of the daily struggle within Gaza. Perhaps the most moving and disturbing moment in &#8220;Gaza&#8221; is the admission of an infant child contemplating the life of a martyr. &#8220;Gaza Strip&#8221; is Longley&#8217;s first feature.

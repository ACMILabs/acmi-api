Von Werra was captured during the Battle of Britain when his Messerschmitt was shot down in the English countryside. The film is significant in that it was made during the period after World War 2 when the majority of British films paid homage to the heroism of British troops. Von Werra&#8217;s meticulous and determined bid for freedom took him across England, Canada, the United States, until he finally reached home. Screenplay by Howard Clewes from the book by Kendal Burt and James Leasor. Cast includes Hardy Kruger, Colin Gordon, Michael Goodliffe and Terence Alexander.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1991953, "name": "Roy Baker", "creator_id": 16925, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q711178", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991952, "name": "Julian Wintle", "creator_id": 17572, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991951, "name": "Rank Organisation Film Productions", "creator_id": 13546, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1991950, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44143", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [27141], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87646, "acmi_id": "309662", "title": "The Malta story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-malta-story", "creator_credit": "Brian Hurst, Peter de Sarigny and British Film-Makers Limited", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1953", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1953-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>RAF camera reconnaissance pilot Peter Ross (Alec Guinness) is trapped on the island of Malta when his plane is destroyed enroute to Egypt in a bombing raid.

In a nightclub on Broadway called the Pigeon Club a suicidal embezzler arrives, wet and hopeless. He is mistaken as a rich country hick ripe for hustling. An alcoholic playwright becomes involved and the plot unfolds. This film, written and directed by Ben Hecht who is famous for witty and sharp dialogue, is well acted with an impressive cast. The hustler and would-be gangster, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is teamed with the good-time girl Rita Hayworth. With a fine script of ironic and poetic dialogue this dark drama is compelling.

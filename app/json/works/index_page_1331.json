Looks at how the nutrient carrying currents and the varying power of the sun interact to control the distribution of life throughout the sea. Shows how the gravitational pull of the moon creates the daily advances and retreats of the tide and how many of the sea creatures take their cue from the moon to reproduce. Explains how seasonal changes transform water temperatures triggering the production of plankton which impacts on the the food chain. Episode 2. &#8216; The Deep&#8217; travels over 900 metres below the surface of the ocean in a submersible observation vessel to explore the creatures that live in these depths. Looks at features which aid an organism&#8217;s survival ensuring that it can detect other creatures without being detected. Movement detectors, camouflage techniques, body structure and sensitive eyes have developed to improve the chances for survival. Episode 3. &#8216;Open oceans&#8217; explores regions located miles away from land, home to the swiftest and most powerful ocean hunters. Creatures in these areas use sonar tracking, water vibrations and exploiting a highly developed sense of smell to detect food in remote areas away from their spawning grounds. Volcanic activity in the ocean creates new land masses and alter the ecology as currents deliver plankton which attracts fish to the new island.

Looks at how the nutrient carrying currents and the varying power of the sun interact to control the distribution of life throughout the sea. Shows how the gravitational pull of the moon creates the daily advances and retreats of the tide and how many of the sea creatures take their cue from the moon to reproduce. Explains how seasonal changes transform water temperatures triggering the production of plankton which impacts on the the food chain. Episode 2. &#8216; The Deep&#8217; travels over 900 metres below the surface of the ocean in a submersible observation vessel to explore the creatures that live in these depths. Looks at features which aid an organism&#8217;s survival ensuring that it can detect other creatures without being detected. Movement detectors, camouflage techniques, body structure and sensitive eyes have developed to improve the chances for survival. Episode 3. &#8216;Open oceans&#8217; explores regions located miles away from land, home to the swiftest and most powerful ocean hunters. Creatures in these areas use sonar tracking, water vibrations and exploiting a highly developed sense of smell to detect food in remote areas away from their spawning grounds.

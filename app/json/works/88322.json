William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is a struggling young playwright suddenly cursed with writer&#8217;s block. He lies to Phillip Henslowe the owner of the Rose Theatre, that his play &#8220;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirates Daughter&#8221; is ready. When the play is cast, William falls in love with the Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) who&#8217;s pretending to be a boy so she can be in the play. This love affair re-ignites Shakespeare&#8217;s passion to write and as the play unfolds during rehearsals it becomes &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221; and Shakespeare emerges as the great playwright that we now take for granted. &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; is a joyous comedy romance which celebrates the passion of words.

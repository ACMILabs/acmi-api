Cast includes: Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Ally Sheedy and Paul Gleason.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School discipline", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958578, "name": "John Hughes", "creator_id": 50775, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958577, "name": "John Hughes", "creator_id": 50775, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958576, "name": "Ned Tanen", "creator_id": 79215, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958575, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19162, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/c0bdxKVRevkw50LOnk6B8d3e4s.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Breakfast club (John Hughes) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46937", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [29258]}]}

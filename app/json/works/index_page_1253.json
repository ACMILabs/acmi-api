Cast also includes Alida Valli, Udo Kier, Stefania Casini, Joan Bennett, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bose, Barbara Magnolfi and Susanna Javicoli.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Germany", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Occultism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witchcraft", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Places&nbsp;→ Germany"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957747, "name": "Dario Argento", "creator_id": 1456, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957746, "name": "Claudio Argento", "creator_id": 1530, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957745, "name": "La Seda", "creator_id": 30848, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18975, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Suspiria  (Dario Argento) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45880", "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [28395]}, {"id": 85, "acmi_id": "tmdb-movie-361292", "title": "Suspiria (2018)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "suspiria-2018", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy and United States of America, 2018", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/dzWTnkert9EoiPWldWJ15dnfAFl.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2018-10-11T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the troupe&#8217;s artistic director, an ambitious young dancer and a grieving psychotherapist.

Jin Zhu, a single mother who lost her husband in a mining accident, must raise a son on her own while flirting with the possibility of remarrying to her brother-in-law. However, the complications which ensue draw out the unspoken realities of the life of country women.<br />\nIt&#8217;s mother Jin Zhu&#8217;s thirtieth birthday and the husband Dameng is expected home any minute to celebrate with his wife and child, Huanhuan. The mother tells a story about the river snail: There was once a small boy whose parents died when he was young, he was diligent and worked hard every day, cooking and cleaning form himself. One day he was eating left overs but found a beautiful meal readily cooked. He finds the next day the meal was prepared by a beautiful girl who was a river snail that fell in love with him for his diligence.</p>\n<p>The brother-in-law Ermeng arrives back. Then the Old Secretary arrives and explains Jin Zhu&#8217;s husband has died. Director Su comes to deliberate what should be done. They all listen to the story of the family, how he was a great dad and a loving husband. After his brother&#8217;s death, Ermeng becomes a train driver to support his sister-in-law and nephew. A palpable sense of tension gradually develops between the brother-in-law and Jin Zhu, made more complex by another girl who has feelings for Ermeng.

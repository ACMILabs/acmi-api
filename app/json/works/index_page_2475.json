The plot follows the various threads that connect the confused lives of two couples in their thirties. Theo, a projectionist in the local theatre, steals a car belonging to lovers Rebecca and Marco and takes it for a joyride. He collides with the car of a local farmer gravely injuring his daughter, but due to a short term memory loss, leaves the scene without helping the injured girl or her family. Later he becomes involved with Laura, a nurse, who has been taking care of the girl. Both couples are rootless and without ambition or drive, and Tywker uses the time allowed by his elliptical narrative to compare and contrast the two relationships on display. He deploys stylistic formalism to make connections between what are essentially shallow characters. Their incompatibilities are underpinned by the use of colour-coding, while the repeated use of lap dissolves sets up unexpected connections between them. Cast includes Floriane Daniel, Heino Ferch, Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem and Josef Bierbichler.

Pregnant and alone, Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) leaves her native home of Ireland in search of Johnny, father of her unborn child. Arriving in Birmingham with few clues as to his location, she meets factory canteen manager Mr Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), a seemingly benevolent gent who offers to help Felicia find lodgings and her love. Hilditchs&#8217; home is a time capsule of 1950&#8217;s homewear, and he spends his evenings watching footage of his mother, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), a successful television chef, and himself as a young child in the background. The relationship revealed throughout the footage is deliciously tinged with antagonism and pain, something that remains with Hilditch throughout his adult life and appears to have influenced his relationship with women. Felicia is not the first wayward soul assisted by Mr Hilditch, as it is revealed he has recorded the innermost thoughts of numerous other women he has picked up in his car - Felicia appears to be the next in line.

Returning from their life in East Africa, the Odene family have settled in Washington D.C. when their world is turned upside down by 5 year old son Lorenzo (Zack O&#8217;Malley Greenburg) who starts displaying &#8220;disturbing behaviour&#8221; at school. After a series of lengthy medical tests, it&#8217;s revealed that Lorenzo is suffering from Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a degenerative disease carried by mothers and passed on to sons. Doctors give Lorenzo a life expectancy of only 2 more years and a horrendous series of side affects until then. A relatively new disease, medical experts have little hope to offer in regards to treatment or cure. Unflagging against insurmountable odds, the Odenes set out researching the disease themselves and communicating with other families afflicted by ALD. Their search leads them to an experimental oil aimed at toning down the side effects of the disease but which also carries a fair amount of risk. A sentimental film that was relatively well received by critics, this is a medical drama of individual success against medical cynicism. Cast also includes Peter Ustinov, Laura Linney, Kathleen Wilhoite and Gerry Bamman. Nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay and Best Actress.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Lorenzo&#8217;s oil</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>George Miller, Doug Mitchell and Universal Pictures</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1992</p>", "description": "<p>Based on the true story of Augusto and Michaela Odene (Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte), &#8220;Lorenzo&#8217;s oil&#8221; dramatises the plight of two determined parents who set out to find treatment for their son against a wall of bureaucracy and medical indeterminancy.

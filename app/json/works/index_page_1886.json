Set in a hyper-corrupt Queensland on the verge of a right-wing coup, the films follows a boozy investigative journalist (Ray Barrett) who stumbles upon the coup plot while searching for a senator&#8217;s wayward daughter. Murray describes the film as a &#8216;very clever piece of controlled fabulation which bursts out of genre strictures into liberating anarchy. Having the absolute courage of its convictions, it takes ideas and boldly pushes them beyond the safe and into a poetic and powerful hyper-realism&#8217;.

The film ends in the girl&#8217;s boyfriend pushing a wheelchair for her, both full of hope for a new life together.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nThe screenwriter of the film, Shi Tiesheng, is a well-known writer in China and Shi is himself a disabled person and wheel-chair bound. The film was devoted to the UN Decade of Disabled Persons, 1983-1992.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Chinese government set up various role models, among which a most famous is a disabled lady, Zhang Haidi, to encourage people, particularly young people, to have firm belief in the socialist course. This film is produced in such a background and reflects the Chinese film authorities&#8217; view that a primary function of film is to educate people.</p>\n<p>Additional Information:<br />\nGood cinematography and editing.</p>\n<p>(3 stars - Yuxing Zhou; May 21, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Life change events", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cancer - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Life change events", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Terminally ill", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2181843, "name": "Lin Hongtong", "creator_id": 82536, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315566", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2181859, "name": "Zhao Qihua", "creator_id": 82754, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159995", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2181840, "name": "Beijing Film Academy", "creator_id": 32706, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126766", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2181867, "name": "Jiang Yunhui", "creator_id": 82756, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121057971", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2181863, "name": "Liu Qiong", "creator_id": 82755, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q15077981", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2181870, "name": "Zuo Ling", "creator_id": 82757, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079380", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2181856, "name": "Cao Zuobin", "creator_id": 82753, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126555", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2181848, "name": "Lin Hongtong", "creator_id": 82536, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315566", "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2181851, "name": "Shi Tiesheng", "creator_id": 82752, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146464", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Release", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [55310]}, {"id": 92005, "acmi_id": "315196", "title": "Deadlock", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "deadlock", "creator_credit": "Unjoo Moon and AFTRS", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The film starts when Anna (played by Kerry Fox) has called the police to arrest her defacto Serge (played by Raj Sidhu).

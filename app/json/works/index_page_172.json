Thus whilst interrogating notions of class and taste, this comedy of manners is also a humanistic and wry portrayal of modern relationships, mores and ways. In her debut feature Agnes Jaoui ably captures the idiosyncrasies and muddled desires of her protagonists, without stooping to bland characterisations or pat conclusions. A contender for Best Foreign Film at the Academy Awards, &#8220;The Taste of others&#8221; won four Cesars (including Best Film) and was nominated for a further five. Cast includes Jean-Pierre Bacri, Anne Alvaro, Agnes Jaoui, Gerard Lanvin, Alain Chabat, Brigitte Catillon, Christiane Millet and Vladimir Yordanoff.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999517, "name": "Agnes Jaoui", "creator_id": 36527, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q240521", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999516, "name": "Charles Gassot", "creator_id": 77206, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999515, "name": "Christian Berard", "creator_id": 80835, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1079125", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999514, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999513, "name": "Telema Productions", "creator_id": 36525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999512, "name": "France2 Cinema", "creator_id": 36524, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999511, "name": "Les Films A4", "creator_id": 36523, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999510, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52436", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34011], "external_references": []}, {"id": 100508, "acmi_id": "318376", "title": "I am Cuba = Soy Cuba = Ya Kuba [NTSC]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-am-cuba-soy-cuba-ya-kuba-ntsc", "creator_credit": "Mikhail Kalatozov, Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC) and Mosfilm", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Cuba, 1964", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A co-production between Cuba and the Soviet Union, Mikhail Kalatozov&#8217;s &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is by turns stirring, affecting, highly entertaining and quite often experimental in execution and structure.

The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas.

The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA). It is certainly florid and melodramatic but the propaganda is not hard to take - not when it is so sumptuously presented and not when, as the four narrative sequences make abundantly clear, the causes for revolution are ethically and economically justified.

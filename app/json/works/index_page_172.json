One woman&#8217;s death - perhaps murder - sparks a crisis in a series on interconnecting relationships. Leon is a policeman investigating the woman&#8217;s disappearance, who&#8217;s emotional stolidity is reflected in his violent dealings with clients; his aging wife Sonja seeks counselling for her desolate personal state; her therapist Valerie, is struggling to cope with the death of her teenage daughter and the deterioration of her marriage to John, an emotionally remote academic; Jane, a lonely and aimless woman, is estranged from her husband Pete and seeks sex with Leon. Miscommunication and secret trysts (real and imagined) leads characters to draw false conclusions. Several red herrings increase the intensity of the murder mystery, but the real concern of the film is the kaleidoscope of human failings and interactions, reflecting a complex interweaving of intent and desire. Paul Kelly&#8217;s score serves as an effective moody soundtrack to the film. Winner of eight AFI awards. Cinematography by Mandy Walker.

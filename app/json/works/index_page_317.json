Solomon keeps his Jewish heritage a secret from his new love, who becomes frustrated by his inability to settle down and marry, and for the unspoken secrets between them. They are forced to re-evaluate their relationship when Gaenor falls pregnant and tensions mount between striking Welsh miners and Jewish storeholders, placing Solomon&#8217;s family in the front line. Director Paul Morrison asserts that the film is principally about the universal notion that we hide aspects of ourselves from those we love.

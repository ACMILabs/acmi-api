Despite this, Xin Tianxi proceeds to purchase the brass set.<br />\nThey head to the Town Offices to ask the Town Leader for permission. At the offices, Xin Tianxi appears to be attracted to the Township Head Miss Li, and he requests her help in starting the band.

Filmed in 1944 and 45, the focus is on one year in the life of a rural French family, observing them through the seasons. The family, cousins of the director living in the farming community of Aveyron in South-central France, act out sequences that correspond to actual events unfurling in their lives. Ideas of modernisation are slowly introduced; the notion of installing electricity for example is debated heatedly among key family members whilst the manual labours of farming life are clearly displayed. A fine example of &#8216;cinema verite&#8217;, the cycle of the seasons is linked to the cycles of life &#8212; birth, death, renewal &#8212; providing a humanist view of nature and the intrinsic phases of rural life. Featuring beautiful time-lapse photography to display the coming of Spring, the film can be read as a paean to a bucolic life, observing the minutiae of nature as well as documenting the hardships of working the land. This fascinating work is highly regarded and won numerous awards including the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes, 1946.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Time lapse cinematography", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural families", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nature photography", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Cinema verite", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - France", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnology", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rural families", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Anthropology", "Places&nbsp;→ France"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929121, "name": "Films Etienne Lallier", "creator_id": 36556, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929122, "name": "Ecran Francais", "creator_id": 36557, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929123, "name": "Georges Rouquier", "creator_id": 17796, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52490", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1946", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1946"}], "labels": [34038]}, {"id": 67415, "acmi_id": "003581", "title": "Farnborough looks forward (1957)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "farnborough-looks-forward-1957", "creator_credit": "British Movietone News", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A survey of the aeroplanes on exhibition at the 1957 Farnborough Air Show featuring some of the latest developments in British aircraft design.

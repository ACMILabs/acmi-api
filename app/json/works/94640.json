Despite being mercilessly teased as a child, Harvek maintains interest in his surrounds, encouraged by his mother who assists him in collecting wonderful &#8216;fakts&#8217; about the world. One night Harvek&#8217;s life is irrevocably altered when WW2 breaks out and he migrates to a faraway land - Australia. In an attempt to assimilate Harvek changes his name to Harvie Krumpet and, in the suburb of Spotswood, begins a new life involving marriage, parenthood and finally, old age. With its melancholic, absurdist tone, &#8220;Harvie Krumpet&#8221; ably captures the peculiarities of this fringe-dwelling character whose desire for knowledge and love transcends the many trials and mixed fortunes of his life.

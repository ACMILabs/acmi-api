The projects were designed to give people who often go unheard a chance to tell their stories. From 1998 to 2004 over five hundred young people were asked to tell stories about when they felt &#8220;not at home&#8221;. The &#8220;Knot at Home&#8221; films present their stories using interviews, narratives, vignettes, songs, animations, dramatised scenes and memories. The young storytellers have made the films themselves, mentored by experienced filmmakers.

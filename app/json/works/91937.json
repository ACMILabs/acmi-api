We see the surfboard manufacturing industries that have emerged in coastal towns such as Torquay where surfer-craftsmen experiment in their eternal quest for the perfect board. The development of the Australian surfing subculture is shown, from the influential U.S. surfers who arrived at the 1956 Olympic Games with their Malibu boards, to the female surfers in the 60&#8217;s who were largely disregarded unless they were tandem surfing with male partners. This culture is not only embraced by groups of mates who tour beaches in their panel vans but increasingly by the professional surfers who move around the world touring circuits from the Seychelles to Bali, and take out world titles in Hawaii. Historic clashes surfers have had with authorities are presented, as well as music clips of Australian surfing songs from Little Pattie, Col Joye, The Delltones, Normie Rowe and Johnny O&#8217;Keefe.

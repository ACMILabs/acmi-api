Old Borgen&#8217;s family is further tested when his son, Johannes is driven mad by reading Kierkegarde and believes he is the risen Christ. Dreyer simply explores the notion of faith by illustrating the inadequacies of doctrines when pitted against people with profound needs. True faith is explored when the family turn in desperation to each other as Inger, the wife of Borgen&#8217;s older son Mikkel and light of the family unexpectedly dies. Dreyer reduces the sound in the film in a way that creates a meditative atmosphere heightening its religious theme.

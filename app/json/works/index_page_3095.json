Casselman, who becomes interested in modernist art and is drawn to the concepts of Zen Buddhism, is attracted to an independent Jewish girl, despite the anti-Semitic ranting of his over-affectionate mother. As a coming-of-age drama &#8220;Going all the way&#8221; plods a fairly predictable path but manages some impressive flourishes, in particular its 1950s aesthetic, ably captured by cinematographer Bobby Bukowsk, and the performances of Jeremy Davies (Secretary, The Million dollar hotel) and Ben Affleck (Pearl Harbour, Good Will Hunting), the latter emitting appropriate charm. Cast includes: Lesley Ann Warren, Rachel Weisz, Rose McGowan, Jill Clayburgh, Amy Locane.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Veterans", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/going-all-the-way", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963674, "name": "PolyGram Filmed Entertainment", "creator_id": 71467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963676, "name": "Lakeshore Entertainment", "creator_id": 31676, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963677, "name": "Tom Gorai", "creator_id": 31677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963679, "name": "Sigurjon Sighvatsson", "creator_id": 77639, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3482118", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963681, "name": "Tom Gorai", "creator_id": 31677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963683, "name": "Mark Pellington", "creator_id": 31678, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q662257", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963678, "name": "Tom Gorai", "creator_id": 31677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963680, "name": "Sigurjon Sighvatsson", "creator_id": 77639, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3482118", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963682, "name": "Tom Gorai", "creator_id": 31677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963684, "name": "Mark Pellington", "creator_id": 31678, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q662257", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963675, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52119", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33744], "external_references": [{"id": 2455, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4015678"}, {"id": 4290, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "118075"}]}, {"id": 77449, "acmi_id": "015704", "title": "Gogodala: a cultural revival", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gogodala-a-cultural-revival", "creator_credit": "Chris Owen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An edited version of a film by Chris Owen which examines the impact of Christianity upon the Gogodala Tribes of Western Papua New Guinea.

Films by great Japanese directors from Muzoguchi, Ozu, Kurosawa, &#8216;Beat&#8217; Takeshi Kitano, Manga films and Japanese documentary makers are all discussed. &#8216;The Cinema On The Road&#8217; is a wonderful documentary which uses the road movie genre as a device to explore the history and current contexts of Korean Cinema. With interesting footage of the Korean landscape and cities, as well as interviews with directors and excerpts and stills from films, this is a fascinating insight into a national cinema which is rarely seen. Both documentaries are in English with interviews and film excerpts in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Kurosawa, Akira, 1910-1998", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - Japan - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Ozu, Yasujiro, 1903-1963", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "People&nbsp;→ Kurosawa, Akira, 1910-1998", "People&nbsp;→ Ozu, Yasujiro, 1903-1963", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2794728, "name": "Jang Sun-Woo", "creator_id": 29180, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298952", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2794726, "name": "Nagisa Oshima", "creator_id": 22968, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55403", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2794721, "name": "Eiko Oshima", "creator_id": 78439, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222842", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2794723, "name": "Park Ki-Yong", "creator_id": 78440, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036310", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2794718, "name": "British Film Institute", "creator_id": 86051, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q260528", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115501, "acmi_id": "S01320", "title": "The Century of cinema", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-century-of-cinema", "creator_credit": "British Film Institute and Channel Four", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 87551, "acmi_id": "309522", "title": "2 x 50 Years of French cinema: night of the filmmakers: I am curious, film", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "2-x-50-years-of-french-cinema-night-of-the-filmmakers-i-am-curious-film", "creator_credit": "Anne-Marie Mieville, Edgar Reitz, Jean-Luc Godard, Stig Bjorkman, Lennart Dunner, Robert Busch, British Film Institute and Channel Four", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 89258, "acmi_id": "311950", "title": "The Century of cinema: Russia and Poland", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-century-of-cinema-russia-and-poland", "creator_credit": "British Film Institute", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 85936, "acmi_id": "307416", "title": "The Century of cinema.

The &#8216;Scooby gang&#8217; are all in the throes of relationship hell. Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara&#8217;s (Amber Benson) love for each other begins to erode as Willow falls deeper into the black arts (addiction metaphors abound in this season), while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Anya (Emma Caulfield) experience pre-wedding jitters with catastrophic consequences (Hell&#8217;s bells Eps. 116). Not to mention the fact that Buffy, the vampire slayer, starts this season dead and buried (Bargaining 1&amp;2 Eps. 101 &amp; 102). Considering how downbeat this season is, surprisingly it&#8217;s the one with the most light and comical villains, the nerdy three, Jonathan, Andrew and Warren (Flooded Eps. 104) - not to mention that they are mere mortals. It&#8217;s also the season that Buffy went musical (Once more with feeling Eps. 107), a Joss Whedon directed episode that proves once and for all how inventive and original this show can be. Buffy&#8217;s resurrection (you didn&#8217;t think she was going to stay dead did you!) proves to be the season&#8217;s overriding story arch as she grapples with being flesh once again and the dire consequences that entails.

Naturally with this new environment the dynamics change. No longer is Buffy the master of her own destiny as she discovers in the opening episode (ep. 45 The Freshman). In fact, university life proves to be a difficult adjustment for the slayer as band of campus vampires target the fragile Buffy and she misjudges the intentions of the campus lothario. Meanwhile, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) has come into her own, University proves to be an exciting challenge for the trainee wicca and the beginning of a new relationship with fellow campus witch, Tara (Amber Benson). There are some welcome returns (and not so welcome) to Sunnydale, notably Anya (Emma Caulfield), an ex-vengeance demon who decides to romantically pursue Xander. The other returning character is the indestructible vampire Spike (James Marsters) who returns with a new girlfriend in tow, the flaky Harmony (ep. 47 The Harsh light of day). The big season arc turns out to be the revelation that Sunnydale college also contains a secret initiative set up by the government to combat the demon problem (ep. 51 The Initiative). Buffy unwittingly becomes involved with the covert group when she falls for one of its soldiers, Riley Finn (Marc Blucas). Midway into the season the &#8216;big bad&#8217;, Adam, is revealed as being an &#8216;initiative&#8217; experiment gone wrong (shades of Frankenstein echo throughout the season).

Naturally with this new environment the dynamics change. No longer is Buffy the master of her own destiny as she discovers in the opening episode (ep, 45 The Freshman). In fact, university life proves to be a difficult adjustment for the slayer as a band of campus vampires target the fragile Buffy and she misjudges the intentions of the campus lothario. Meanwhile, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) has come into her own. University proves to be an exciting challenge for the trainee wicca and the beginning of a new relationship with fellow campus witch, Tara (Amber Benson). There are some welcome returns (and not so welcome) to Sunnydale, notably Anya (Emma Caulfield), an ex-vengeance demon who decides to romantically pursue Xander. The other returning character is the indestructible vampire Spike (James Marsters) who returns with a new girlfriend in tow, the flaky Harmony (ep. 47 The Harsh light of day). The big season arc turns out to be the revelation that Sunnydale college also contains a secret initiative set up by the government to combat the demon problem (ep. 51 The Initiative). Buffy unwittingly becomes involved with the covert group when she falls for one of its soldiers, Riley Finn (Marc Blucas). Midway into the season the &#8216;big bad&#8217; is revealed as being an &#8216;initiative&#8217; experiment gone wrong, Adam (shades of Frankenstein echo throughout the season). Considered one of the more difficult years by fans, Whedon and his band of writers fashioned a more mature season that saw the gang entering into more emotionally complex terrain, as the realities of college life and adulthood threatened to split their friendships apart. The season curiously ended with a stand alone episode which hinted at difficult times ahead for the slayer. (ep. 66 Restless).

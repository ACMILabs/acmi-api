When Hyo-shin commits suicide, her classmates regard Shi-eun with suspicion. &#8220;Memento mori&#8221; depicts in flashback the origins of the affair and the background to the contents of the diary. A third classmate - Min-ah - discovers the diary and is drawn into their web of intrigue. Reading the diary in the hope of unravelling its secrets, Min-ah starts to hear voices and experience supernatural incidents. Shifting narrative perspectives suggests that its deceased owner may haunt the keeper of the diary. Wild dreamscape visuals drive the film, which depicts the social environment of the school as ruthless and bitchy. Bored with their studies and stupefied by the heat, the girls form gossipy groups with shifting loyalties. As outsiders, Hyo-shin and Shi-eun are targets for cruelty and taunting.

Living with her father and a handful of servants in a large mansion, her mother having passed away, Ema assumes the role of the matriarch or feminine ideal from an early age.

He plays a burnt out Phoenix cop on an assignment to bring back from Las Vegas a &#8216;nothing witness for a nothing trial&#8217; (Locke) which seems just another meaningless task in a meaningless life. Until the fireworks start! Trapped by treachery on both sides of the law, the two are forced through a deadly obstacle course of raging gunfire, blazing cars, swooping helicopters, murderous ambushes, crazed bikers and crooked police. With non-stop action and special effects that will blast you to the back of your seat, including a ferocious finale in which an armoured bus is shot to smithereens with more than 8,000 bullets (8000 bullets and none hit the tyres!).

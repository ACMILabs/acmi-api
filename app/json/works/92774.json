The film is broken up into four separate tales which all intertwine and connect with each other. The first tale &#8220;Rutilio&#8221; introduces a middle-aged owner of a small bar in the town. Rutilio (Ernesto Gomez Cruz), estranged from his wife and family is about to embark on an affair, the consequences of which will have a devastating effect on his family particularly his son, Chava. The second tale &#8220;Alma&#8221; is about a young, beautiful and rather naive girl, Alma (Selma Hayek) who is patiently waiting for the return of her fiance Abel (Bruno Bichir) from the United States. Abel has gone to the States to make money so he can come back and marry Alma. Life however becomes complicated for Alma and feeling lonely and missing Abel, she finds herself attracted to the attentions of the suave but rather unsavoury Jose Luis (Daniel Gimenez Cacho). Her life is about to be changed forever. The third story &#8220;Susanita&#8221; tells of the spinster landlady of a small apartment block in the neighbourhood who longs for romance in her rather sad and lonely life. Susanita (Margarita Sanz) unwittingly and tragically ends up in a &#8220;sham&#8221; marriage. &#8220;El Regreso&#8221; (The Return), the fourth story, ties up all the plot threads of romance, deceit, human frailty, sadness and despair into one final act. Based on the novel by Egyptian writer and Nobel prize winner, Naguib Mahfuz, and winner of 45 international film awards, including Berlin and Chicago, this is a fine film with an excellent supporting cast including Maria Rojo, Delia Casanova, Claudio Obregon, Juan Manuel Bernal.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Midaq Alley = El Callejon de los Milagros</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Jorge Fons, Alfredo Ripstein Jr, Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia and Alameda Films</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Mexico, 1994</p>", "description": "<p>Set in a poor section of downtown Mexico City, &#8220;Midaq Alley&#8221; is a story of several characters, each with their own story to tell, and each bound together inextricably by their inhabitance of this rather rundown derelict neighbourhood.

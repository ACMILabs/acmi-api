The &#8220;Big Four&#8221; embarked on massive steam locomotive construction programs to replace the many different types inherited in 1923, although the Southern pursed electrification in order to eliminate steam. We visit familiar and not-so familiar locations to see steam at work, from the great main lines to the rural branches including Ireland which had 3 railways of its own and the Isle of Wight.

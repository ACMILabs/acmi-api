On the other side of the border lives 14 year-old Manar in the Dheisha refugee camp, Bethlehem, Palestine which is controlled by the Israelis. The film focuses on these two young girls, their daily life, their dreams, hopes and aspirations and their friendship which was born through the internet and letter-writing - activities which are made available for the children within the refugee camps. One of the most poignant moments in the film occurs when groups of children, including Mona and Manar, from both camps are able to meet at the Lebanese/Israeli border separated by fences of razor wire. The emotion, both of joy and of sadness, runs high. It is an extremely moving moment. Many of the children from both refugee camps share their hopes and fears to the camera but one always gets the feeling of the underlying tensions that exist even when at times they appear to be giggling and acting light-hearted as teenagers do the world over. However, the desire to return to their homes and their homeland is strong as witnessed by their music, poetry and writings, the longing of the Shatila children to touch the dirt of Palestine and to treasure gifts of Palestinian soil sent from the children of Dheisha. Award-winning Palestinian filmmaker Mai Masri (Children of fire, Children of Shatila, War generation: Beirut) once again has produced a film with sensitivity and a certain freedom of spirit by allowing the children to tell their stories in their own way.

are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film Les and Dorothy Nixon show off their first baby Karen (who features in the Nixon Collection until she is an adult herself) at their home in Herne Hill, Geelong, Victoria. There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking.

Forget ‘lifestyles of the rich and famous’, this family collection spanning over twenty one years is far more enlightening and endearing.</p>\n<p>This collection of home movies was donated to ACMI by Karen Corry.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The Nixon Family Home Movie Collection tells the story of a suburban family in 1960s–1980s Geelong, Victoria, with Mum (Dorothy) and Dad (Les) and the two kids, Karen and Stuart. Les and Dorothy lived at Herne Hill, Geelong, where the films show the two children growing up. Particularly Karen, from when she was a newborn baby up to her 21st birthday and first car.</p>\n<p>Captured over ten movies, initially on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, most of the footage was taken by Les but occasionally when he appears on screen, we know Dorothy was behind the camera.</p>\n<p>Through these family films we see the children grow up, the fun of beach holidays, fancy hats worn at family weddings, games played at birthdays and special holiday destinations. Some of the loveliest footage shows the simple pastimes of children: ‘dinking’ your baby brother around in the back of the tricycle at home, burying yourself up to the waist in the sand at the beach and jumping over a sprinkler on a hot day in the backyard by the ‘Hills Hoist’.</p>\n<p>The large extended family also feature in the films and they would often holiday at their cousin’s beach house at 8th Avenue, Point Roadknight, on the Surf Coast of Victoria. In 1966, the family also spent some time in the sandy yard of a home in Alice Springs, from where they visit Amoonguna, an indigenous community 15kms southwest of Alice.</p>\n<p>Visits from “Nana and Pop”, playing tennis, visiting a farm and family picnics also feature. Forget ‘lifestyles of the rich and famous’, this family collection spanning over twenty one years is far more enlightening and endearing.</p>\n<p>This collection of home movies was donated to ACMI by

Focussing on the Clarence River District and the towns of Grafton, Inverell, Coffs Harbour, Casino, Lismore, Tenterfield, Iluka, Glen Innes, Maclean and Moree, the program is segmented into decades allowing the viewer to see towns change and evolve over a 50 year period. Entertaining and informative, the video provides a social commentary of Australian lifestyle, industries and landscape, highlighting such events as the Grafton Jacaranda Festival, street parades at Inverell and Casino, the Annual Flower Show at Lismore, centenary celebrations for both Maclean and Coff&#8217;s Harbour and royal celebrations for Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s coronation. Also includes footage of some of the industries which have progressed and developed in the district and along the river - oyster farms, fishing, dairying, cane-cutting and timber.

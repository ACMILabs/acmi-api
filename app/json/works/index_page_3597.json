Later Alphonse&#8217;s wife is found murdered and her hapless murderer almost immediately confesses to Alphonse, but neither the husband, nor the police inspector seem to be shocked. The three sit down to enjoy a friendly drink when a man arrives and accuses Alphonse of the subway murder. &#8216;Buffet Froid&#8217; is a wonderfully absurd black comedy that cunningly reverses the conventions of the crime thriller to comment on the alienating and dehumanizing effects of contemporary urban life.

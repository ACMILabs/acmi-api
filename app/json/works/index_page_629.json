enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight.

One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking.

Born in Budapest, Hungary, Tibor lived in Melbourne, Victoria with his family. His wife Merna Koller was a frequent collaborator on these films, showing a shared interest in filmmaking.</p>\n<p>Tibor captured suburban family life in Melbourne, including family celebrations, urban scenes and regional holidays. Tibor was actively engaged in the lapidary society of Australia. Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller.

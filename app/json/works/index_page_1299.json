British matinee idol Ivor Novello plays Jonathan Drew, a quiet, secretive young man who rents a room in a London boarding house. Drew&#8217;s arrival coincides with the reign of terror orchestrated by Jack the Ripper. As the film progresses, circumstantial evidence begins to mount, pointing to Drew as the selfsame Ripper. In the original story by Mrs Belloc-Lownes, suspicions concerning Drew were confirmed; but Ivor Novello was a star of the first magnitude, and stars of the first magnitude just didn&#8217;t play murderers back in 1926.

The story revolves around Colin&#8217;s thwarted relationship with Suzette, who works for a chic couturier in Mayfair. Inspired by the artifice of Classic Hollywood musicals, director Julien Temple, who had previously made a name filming rock videos, gives this genre a visually inventive and energetic twist. The film features an impressive one-take opening sequence a la &#8216;Touch of Evil&#8217;, a string of dazzling production numbers set to a jazz inflected score by Gil Evans and a cast that includes David Bowie, Sade, Ray Davies, James Fox and Patsy Kensit.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Racism in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ London (England) - Social life and customs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cults", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959703, "name": "Palace Pictures", "creator_id": 24324, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959704, "name": "Virgin Films", "creator_id": 32779, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959705, "name": "Goldcrest Films", "creator_id": 21784, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959706, "name": "Stephen Woolley", "creator_id": 71841, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959707, "name": "Chris Brown", "creator_id": 61116, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959708, "name": "Julien Temple", "creator_id": 32780, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48544", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [30692]}, {"id": 98247, "acmi_id": "507786", "title": "Abseiling", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "abseiling", "creator_credit": "Explorer Films and Peter Halket", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>An instructional film on abseiling techniques.

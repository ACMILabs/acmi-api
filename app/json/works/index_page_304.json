Brandon&#8217;s promise of sexual assault become one of the many obstacles Dawn must deal with in her unrelenting journey through puberty, along with unsympathetic parents, a younger prissy sister that is unbearably wholesome, and a painful crush on the dreamy school rebel Steve (Eric Mabius). Cast also includes Daria Kalinina, Matthew Faber and Dimitri Iervolino.

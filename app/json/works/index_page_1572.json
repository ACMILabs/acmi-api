The story joins the Inter Dental Space Commander and his assistants, Honey and Rubbish, who are having a messy day at work when their spaceship comes under attack from the thuggish Redworm. The Dental Space Commander and his assistants escape with the prized artefact the Wave Twister, which came from the hip-hop planet Quasar 16.33.45.78. The band of heroes, with B-Boy Grandpa, go to the planet hoping to revive the lost arts of hip-hop (scratching, rapping, breakdancing, and graffiti) which has been outlawed by the tyrannical Lord Ook and enforced by his Octobots and the master turntablism of DJ QBert, D-Styles, and Yoga Frog. Full of references to the new (virus scanners, internet, music downloads), and old (muscle cars, old video games, and schlocky science fiction), &#8220;Wave twisters&#8221; is a film that is a must for hip-hop and animation fans alike.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "German", "Japanese", "Polish", "Russian", "Spanish", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ DJs (Disc jockeys)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap musicians", "Musicals", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924024, "name": "Eric Henry", "creator_id": 80164, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924023, "name": "Syd Garon", "creator_id": 80163, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924022, "name": "Yoga Frog", "creator_id": 34849, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924021, "name": "Thud Rumble Ltd", "creator_id": 34848, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50697", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32663]}, {"id": 74533, "acmi_id": "30268", "title": "Wave particle duality", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wave-particle-duality", "creator_credit": "British Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1974", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Introduces and discusses the dual nature of light and matter and traces the development of the theory of wave-particle duality.

Extremely well-crafted and well-scripted, &#8220;The Bank&#8221; is an engrossing, thoroughly entertaining corporate thriller. Shot entirely on location in Melbourne, it is an accomplished Australian genre film and its anti-bank, anti-corporate politics make it perfectly suited to contemporary audiences. Finally, &#8220;The Bank&#8221; is bolstered by flawless performances, including Anthony La Paglia as the evil O&#8217;Reilly and David Wenham as the sensitive, multi-layered Doyle, and a host of supporting actors including Sibylla Budd, Steve Rodgers, and Greg Stone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Money", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Money market", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Stock exchanges", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Stock exchanges - Economic aspects", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-bank", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1818936, "name": "John Maynard", "creator_id": 51466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961999, "name": "Arenafilm", "creator_id": 64646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962000, "name": "Showtime Australia", "creator_id": 69553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962002, "name": "Robert Connolly", "creator_id": 64647, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961998, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50838", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32798], "external_references": [{"id": 5628, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "15486"}]}, {"id": 81220, "acmi_id": "302290", "title": "The Band Wagon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-band-wagon", "creator_credit": "Arthur Freed, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Vincente Minnelli", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1953", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1953-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A has-been Hollywood dancer joins forces with a temperamental stage producer to put on a Broadway musical. &#8220;The Band Wagon&#8221; has a witty, original screenplay, with some of the most exciting musical numbers ever put on film.

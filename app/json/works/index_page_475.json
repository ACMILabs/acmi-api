This illuminating work features historical re-enactments, as well as interviews with contemporary scholars, to recall the ancient worlds depicted in the Bible. Episode 1. &#8220;By the rivers of Babylon&#8221;: In 586 BC, the Israelites were exiled in Babylon and seemed destined to disappear; but they fought back by writing a book using Judean stories to explain the present disastrous situations - the Bible. Episode 2. &#8220;The Book and the sword&#8221;: In 458 BC a scribe named Ezra arrived in Jerusalem from Babylon; gathering the mostly illiterate Judeans together he read the Bible to them. In the following years study of the Bible became an essential part of Jewish life. Episode 3. &#8220;The End of days&#8221;: When the Roman General Pompeii led his legions into the land of Judea in 63 BC it was the beginning of a clash of cultures that grew into one of the most brutal conflicts in history. Terrorism, political assassination, starvation and crucifixion dominated the landscape, ending with the Roman sack of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD. From the aftermath, two new religions rose: rabbinical Judaism and Christianity.

A former persecutor of Christians, Peter soon becomes an indomitable figure, uniting the group into a tight community of ardent believers.

Episode 2. &#8220;The Empire and the Kingdom&#8221; - Led by missionaries, Christian ideas continue to spread among Jews and non-Jews throughout the Empire; hostile locals, imperial forces and conflicting ideas threaten the future of the movement. Paul splits with his former allies, establishing churches in his image; in 70 AD, after decades of tensions, a four-year war erupts that destroys much of Jerusalem, but the communities established by Paul survive and grow.

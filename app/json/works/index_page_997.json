But with the growing force of the new bourgeois class and with Garibaldi&#8217;s move to unify the whole of the Italian people into one country, the age of royalty and aristocracy is coming to an end. The Prince knows too well that he is unable to resist the force of history: all he can do is ensure that he secures the best possible future for his family, including his opportunistic nephew, Tancredi (Alain Delon). Visconti, the Marxist Count, faithfully evokes Di Lampedusa&#8217;s lament for the dying, decadent class. But Visconti was also able to create a richly sumptuous work that conveys the architecture, morality, mores and manners of a past world. Rotunno&#8217;s justly acclaimed cinematography assist him in creating a series of lavish sequences set both in the rugged Sicilian countryside and inside the decaying mansions and palazzos belonging to the Prince. The film culminates at a ball in which Tancredi and his fiance (Claudia Cardinale) are to be introduced to the new Sicilian bourgeoisie (who have already turned against their liberator, Garibaldi, and are hoping to take on for themselves the privileges and lifestyle of the aristocrats). The Prince surveys this new world and is aware of his own approaching death, and through this awareness, the death of a culture, a class and a world. The ball is a beautifully choreographed ballet in which we see displays of dazzling wealth; it is also a cruel recognition of the ruthlessness of power.

Reuben, this Woody Allen classic answers some of the timeless (and tasteless) questions about society&#8217;s oldest taboo: sex. It consists of a series of vignettes, one of which has Gene Wilder experiencing a woolly love affair with a sheep, and another has Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds showing an unorthodox view of sex - from the inside out. Woody Allen once said about sex: &#8220;It&#8217;s the most fun I&#8217;ve ever had without laughing.&#8221; Allen&#8217;s confronting style may not sit well with all viewers - you may find yourself squirming uncomfortably in your seat at some of the scenes - and it may not be everything you always wanted to know about sex, but as a comedy it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;ve always known about Woody Allen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2614056, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25089", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2614055, "name": "Charles H.

While many of these films have been tragically lost, those that remain offer a rare glimpse into Australian life during this turbulent time.</p>\n<p>As the war began, filmmakers rushed to make features about Australia’s involvement. Alfred Rolfe’s &#8216;Hero of the Dardanelles&#8217; (1915) told the story of Gallipoli, complete with landing scenes shot at Tamarama Beach in Sydney.</p>\n<p>However, as the years progressed, war-weary audiences lost their taste for patriotic stories, and a new genre of home-grown comedies emerged featuring knockabout characters from the Australian bush. Throughout the war years, Hollywood dramas, serials, love stories and comedies were also staple attractions, and Charlie Chaplin was an international superstar.</p>\n<p>War Pictures offers a wide-ranging selection of local and international material, including a focus on Australia’s ‘lost films’.</p>\n<p>Specially commissioned introductions and musical accompaniment offer contemporary audiences a chance to step back time and experience cinema as it was enjoyed during the First World War.</p>\n<p>This work was shown at ACMI from 10 March to 26 July 2015 in the &#8216;War Pictures&#8217; exhibition.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:07:52:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Australia - History", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "History&nbsp;→ War - Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Social aspects - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1772189, "name": "ACMI", "creator_id": 6272, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1772190, "name": "National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "creator_id": 10175, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes422; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "188503", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2015", "notes": "Based on exhibition date", "to_year": "2015"}], "labels": [59659], "external_references": []}, {"id": 117830, "acmi_id": "B2003476", "title": "[Remix: ACMI Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "remix-acmi-collection", "creator_credit": "Field Carr and ACMI", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2017", "video_links": [{"id": 1155, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/voNSlwXyl7Q"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2017-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>&#8220;Some of the thousands of stories in our collection.&#8221;  This playful short film set to music, is a tribute to the gems in the ACMI Collection.

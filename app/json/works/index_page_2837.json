The basic materials derived from this process comprised hundreds of poignant, beautiful, cruel and comforting stories. Filmmakers Phillip Crawford and Matthew Priestly from youth arts organization BIG hART worked with the young people to create an AFI award winning film, &#8216;Hurt&#8217; in which fragmented, poetic and haunting stories of isolation and hardship are told through the words and images created by the young artists. In this new ACMI commissioned project filmmakers from BIG hART have turned the material into a multi-screen spatial installation that puts the viewer into the midst of this fragmented world of broken lives, beauty and bravery.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Youth - Australia", "Digital Art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Multi channel moving image installation"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1039346, "name": "Phillip Crawford", "creator_id": 6793, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039345, "name": "Phillip Crawford", "creator_id": 6793, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039344, "name": "BIG hART", "creator_id": 6792, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039343, "name": "BIG hART", "creator_id": 6792, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1039342, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1039341, "name": "Rhys Graham", "creator_id": 6398, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Preview Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "388", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "The project will move into production upon receiving Board approval.", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [47648]}, {"id": 93040, "acmi_id": "316400", "title": "Hurt", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hurt", "creator_credit": "Mathew Perry, Phillip Crawford, The Omni Group, BIG hART and Arts Northwest", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Initiated by BIG hART, a non profit organisation which pilots art projects for marginalised young people, this film allowed rural Australian youth to translate stories based on their personal experiences of familial violence onto film.

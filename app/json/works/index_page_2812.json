Because of the importance of this 2000 years old Irrigation system to the development of Sichuan and the Yangtze River region, Li Bing became a great Chinese cultural icon, hailed as a great civil administrator and Water conservation expert. In Chinese mythology, he is known as the vanquisher of the River God, whom the people believed to have caused all the turbulent rainfalls and flooding in the Sichuan region. When he arrived in Shu, Li Bing witnessed the sufferings of local people from frequent flooding of Minjiang River.

These films comprise an engrossing study of the city as it once was, the city as we know it now and the city as it may be if it survives the dangers which Mr. Mumford points out on the screen. Filmed in eleven countries, a master view is presented of the city, and the glories of city life with the achievements, failures and promises of our urban culture made plain. Throughout the films you feel the warm attachment to cities which underlies Mr. Mumford&#8217;s conviction that &#8220;the city is man&#8217;s most precious collective invention&#8221;. He asks and tries to answer: What has the city done to ennoble man in the past? What is it doing now to rob him of rewards that urban life should give him?

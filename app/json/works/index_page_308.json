Officer Ellen Ripley and the crew of the starship Nostromo encountered such a creature and she alone survived the massacre. After floating in space for years Ripley is rescued only to learn that she must return to the planet where her nightmare began. L.V. 426, the world where Ripley first encountered the Alien is now colonised. When communication is lost with the settlers, a team of battle hardened space marines is sent with Ripley and find not one creature, but thousands - the Alien is breeding. Cast includes Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn and Paul Reiser.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/aliens", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1992504, "name": "James Cameron", "creator_id": 66977, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992503, "name": "Gale Anne Hurd", "creator_id": 70414, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992502, "name": "Brandywine Productions", "creator_id": 71300, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1992501, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1992500, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45042", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [27633], "external_references": []}]}

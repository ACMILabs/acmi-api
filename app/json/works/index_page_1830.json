This classic opera set in 1904 on the outskirts of Nagasaki, tells the tragic story of Cio-Cio-San (Ying Huang), a 15 year-old Japanese girl who falls in love with an American sailor named Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton (Richard Troxell). Butterfly (Pinkerton&#8217;s name for Cio-Cio-San), blinded by passion marries Pinkerton, against her family&#8217;s wishes. However, Pinkerton&#8217;s intentions turn out to be not so honourable, returning to America without Butterfly, but promising he will be back soon. Butterfly is left heart-broken but always hopeful of his return. Three long years pass by before Pinkerton, after learning that Butterfly had given birth to a son fathered by him just before his return to America, decides to make the trip back to Japan. Only this time he has a wife in tow and the sole intention of taking his child back to America leaving Butterfly entirely alone. What follows is a most tragic and heart-breaking climax. Seeing opera presented in film as opposed to on stage has quite a powerful effect. Film through its cinematography (Phillipe Welt) opens up the boundaries of scope of outside landscapes and lush settings enhancing the period of costume, culture, mood and the beautiful music of Puccini and allowing a natural flow to the story. Superb performances by the leading singers with a great support performance by Ning Liang (Suzuki), Richard Cowen (Sharpless), Jing Ma Fan, Christopheren Nomura, Constance Hauman, Yo Kusakabe, Kamel Touati, Miki-Lou Pinard.

Unlike films such as &#8220;Longtime companion&#8221; which attempted to homogenise and de-radicalise the experience of living with AIDS, &#8220;The Living end&#8221; shocked many viewers by placing two unapologetic survivors, whose anger and hatred is not muted, at the centre of its narrative. Araki&#8217;s low-budget aesthetic, influenced by equal measures of love for both punk music and the cinema of the French Nouvelle Vague, allowed him to create a truly dynamic, rough but wickedly subversive comedy road movie. Its humour, and its emotional vitality, remain undiluted.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Comedy", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ AIDS (Disease) in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ AIDS (Disease)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ AIDS (Disease) in motion pictures", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-living-end", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997817, "name": "Gregg Araki", "creator_id": 29102, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997816, "name": "Jim Stark", "creator_id": 26183, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997815, "name": "Marcus Hu", "creator_id": 80300, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997814, "name": "Jon Gerrans", "creator_id": 80299, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997813, "name": "Desperate Pictures", "creator_id": 29100, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51044", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [32981]}, {"id": 93460, "acmi_id": "316902", "title": "To Kill a mockingbird [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "to-kill-a-mockingbird-dvd", "creator_credit": "Robert Mulligan, Alan Pakula, Brentwood and Pakula-Mulligan Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This is an atmospheric adaptation by Horton Foote of Harper Lee&#8217;s sensitive novel of the same name.

Eventually Albert discovers his wife&#8217;s infidelity and takes violent revenge, triggering a more unusual retaliation from her. This film is a parable about love, revenge and most of all greed, it is both funny and horrifying. Sacha Vierny&#8217;s cinematography and Greenaway&#8217;s use of colour are superb. Also stars Tim Roth, Richard Bohringer and Alan Howard.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-cook-the-thief-his-wife-and-her-lover", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2341056, "name": "Peter Greenaway", "creator_id": 51033, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55282", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2341055, "name": "Kees Kasander", "creator_id": 72935, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55688372", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2341047, "name": "Allarts Cook", "creator_id": 25173, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035963", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2341050, "name": "Erato FIlms", "creator_id": 25174, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299281", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2341052, "name": "Films Incorporated", "creator_id": 12008, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2341045, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38952", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [22538]}]}

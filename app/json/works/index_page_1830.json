Their initial exuberance gives way to panic when the owner returns for his crop. The group lock him into the basement while they figure out what to do. Starting as a light comedy, &#8220;Scarfies&#8221; shifts a gear and becomes increasingly black, resulting in a nightmarish thriller where the central characters&#8217; morale and logic having fallen apart give way to desperate behaviour. Cast includes: Willa O&#8217;Neill, Neill Rea, Ashleigh Seagar, Taika Cohen, Charlie Bleakley, John Brazier, Mark Neilson and Mark Dudfield.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social conditions", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students - Attitudes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs, Nonprescription"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2263421, "name": "Robert Sarkis", "creator_id": 34840, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263415, "name": "Lisa Chatfield", "creator_id": 34839, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299099", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263413, "name": "Nightmare Productions", "creator_id": 34838, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357756", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2263408, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50680", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32653]}, {"id": 89096, "acmi_id": "311743", "title": "SBS Insight: millennium bug", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sbs-insight-millennium-bug", "creator_credit": "Tatjana Djamin and Australia.

Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) heads the group of war weary men chosen to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been tragically killed in combat. Aside from the harrowing battle sequences (brilliantly shot by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) which fully realise the horrors and waste of war, Spielberg&#8217;s attempt at asking complex questions about human nature, is confused at times and morally simplistic at others. Cast includes Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Jeremy Davies, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Ted Danson and Dennis Farina (Awards: Winner of five 1998 Academy Awards including Best Director, Steven Spielberg, Best Cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, Best Film Editing, Michael Kahn)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Normandy (France)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Normandy (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/saving-private-ryan", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2263243, "name": "Steven Spielberg", "creator_id": 72103, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q8877", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263242, "name": "Gary Levinsohn", "creator_id": 71381, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1494906", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263239, "name": "Ian Bryce", "creator_id": 72288, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q536964", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263240, "name": "Mark Gordon", "creator_id": 72383, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2417149", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263237, "name": "Amblin Entertainment", "creator_id": 67925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263238, "name": "Mutual", "creator_id": 23389, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263227, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263232, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q159846", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2263225, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44823", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27576]}, {"id": 84914, "acmi_id": "306257", "title": "Schindler: the list of life", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "schindler-the-list-of-life", "creator_credit": "Ted Newsome, Ray Atherton and Wavelength Video Production", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Oskar Schindler was not the &#8220;stuff from which heroes are made&#8221;.

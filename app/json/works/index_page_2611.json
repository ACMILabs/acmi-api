Four years and one flop (&#8216;Welcome to Woop Woop&#8217;) later, Elliott is making &#8216;Eye of the beholder&#8217; a film with a twelve million dollar budget, and an impressive cast which includes Ewan McGregor, k.d. lang, Ashley Judd and Jason Priestley. The storyline promises action-adventure in nine American cities across four different seasons. The financing has been done outside the studio system - through a team of sales agents who want a profit - or else, adding undue pressure to the project. Enter Lizzy Gardiner. Academy Award-winning costume designer and friend of Elliott&#8217;s for more than twenty years. In addition to bringing her expertise as a costume designer, Gardina also brings a Sony 1000 DVC camera, and in a moment of insanity Elliott gives her permission to document the whole process.

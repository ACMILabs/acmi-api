However, they may have gotten more than they bargained for, as these friends journey to revitalise the cultural traditions of post-Cultural Revolution China threatens to tear them apart.</p>\n<p>A bunch of foreigners enter a packed theatre to enjoy a performance of Classical Chinese Orchestral music. Featured amongst the instruments is a reproduction of the 2400-year-old massive chime bells (Bian Zhong) and Drums from the Chu Dynasty. The singing is accompanied with a beautiful chorus of bells struck by sticks. The songs are interluded with the applause and positive comments made by foreigners, reminiscences of the woman who organised the performance.</p>\n<p>After this musical introduction the film gradually recounts the trials and tribulations associated with staging this massive production, breaking up the rather strained narrative with beautifully composed interpretations of these classical tunes.</p>\n<p>The orchestra has a broad repertory, performing songs about wartime, dance, poetry and, last but not least, the unification of the country to achieve ultimate prosperity. The film is extremely self-conscious as a foreign export of propaganda for the wonders of traditional Chinese music.</p>\n<p>We are introduced to the Bian Zhong (编钟) as the “eighth wonder of the world.” Its 55 different sized bells, with the biggest weighing 203 kg and the smallest at 2.4 kg. The bells are inscribed with 2400 characters listing the different scales, whose seven note scale system is the same as the contemporary system.</p>\n<p>Despite these revelations, many of the younger Chinese people call it  &#8220;junk&#8221; and &#8220;useless relics&#8221;. The daughter of the historian introducing the Bian Zhong expresses her dissallusionment with contemporary Chinese attitudes toward their own culture. &#8220;The Bian Zhong is a symbol of our ancient culture. I don&#8217;t understand how they would think things like that&#8221;, she whines.</p>\n<p>Presumably speaking out as the mouthpiece of the state, the father blames these negative attitudes to Chinese culture on the Cultural Revolution. &#8220;The ten years of chaos caused a great gap in peoples education.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These direct English translation comes across rather stale. For example, during this conversation between daughter and father, Xia ying says:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hey, father, I was thinking we could invent some new music for the Bian Zhong.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Hey, that sounds like a very good idea! Why don&#8217;t you tell me about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This eventually leads them to incorporate contemporary methods into the musical tradition of the Bian Zhong in order to draw popular attention to traditional Chinese music.

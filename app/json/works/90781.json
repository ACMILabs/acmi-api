The hunt for the Son of Sam is merged with the story of two couples: Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Diona (Mira Sorvino), a married Italo-American couple whose relationship is threatened by Vinny&#8217;s guilt-stricken affairs; and Ritchie (Aidrien Brody) and Gloria (Jennifer Esposito), two outcasts - he because he refuses to fit the macho stereotypes of the Italian culture, she because of her &#8220;slutty&#8221; past - who both find acceptance in the growing punk scene of downtown New York. By focussing his camera on the world of working-class Italo-Americans, Spike Lee is not abandoning his commitment to examining American racism.

Being a Spike Lee joint, the film is also a wonderful celebration of music, both disco and punk, as well as a sophisticated examination of love and marriage, and bisexuality. Fast-paced, with excellent art design and a superb score, &#8220;Summer of Sam&#8221; emerges as a bittersweet love poem to the city of New York: its clubs and its porn theatres, its residents black and white, its uptown charms and its downtown sleaze.

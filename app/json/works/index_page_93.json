discusses the history and legends of the Celtic people of Early Europe through to the year 2000. Using paintings, historical locations, buildings and re-enactments, this episode spans the 8th century through to the 17th century, recounting the wars, invasions, and the blood spilt in the name of the Church and a &#8220;United Kingdom&#8221;. The story begins with the Viking invasion in 793 AD on the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne where the complex web of Celtic Churches were savagely attacked and destroyed. This invasion, occupation and settlement, continued on through the years to 1066 and the Battle of Hastings when William, Duke of Normandy, defeated Harold II, and took the English throne heralding the beginning of a mass takeover by the Normans. Over time, the Celtic culture was almost absorbed and reality and truth lost its way as in the legend of King Arthur - the myth lives on even today. The continual assault on the Celtic communities by the English led to turmoil and revolt during the 1300s, with Scotland seemingly the only one to retain its independence through the emergence of William Wallace and then Robert Bruce. By 1532 AD, Brittany was defeated and absorbed into France, and in 1536 Wales became part of England. Under the reign of Elizabeth I (1550-1600 AD), Ireland fell fully under English rule and so began the &#8220;Irish problem&#8221;. From 1608 onwards, &#8220;plantations&#8221; began in Ireland whereby Protestant English and Scottish were encouraged to settle in Ireland and try and rid Ireland of its Catholic population.

At the same time the emergence of Christianity in Ireland is investigated in the program, with a discussion of the establishment of a veneer of the Roman Church over the already existing religious beliefs in the Celtic world and the eventual ruin of the true Celtic Church this caused.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Celts", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and religion", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholic Church", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religions", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Celts", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Ireland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Celtic", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Church history - Anglo Saxon period, 449-1066", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - Anglo Saxon period, 449-1066", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Middle Ages", "History&nbsp;→ Religions", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "History&nbsp;→ Rome - History - Empire - 30BC-476AD", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3082670, "name": "Caryl Ebenezer", "creator_id": 80006, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086170", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082672, "name": "J Williams", "creator_id": 80007, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082668, "name": "Comataldh Craolaidh Gaidhlig", "creator_id": 34537, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223393", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082662, "name": "Opus Television", "creator_id": 34535, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159895", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082666, "name": "S4C International", "creator_id": 34536, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271396", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082664, "name": "Sianel 4 Cymru (S4C) (Channel 4 Wales)", "creator_id": 25343, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143646", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 3082660, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115568, "acmi_id": "S01404", "title": "The Celts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-celts", "creator_credit": "Caryl Ebenezer, J Williams, Opus Television and SBS-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93034, "acmi_id": "316394", "title": "A Dead song?

A study of rock art and archaeological findings of jewellery and various artefacts opens the program with a discussion of their symbolism that has remained relatively unknown for centuries save for their significance to key events and rituals inherent in the Celtic civilisation and their stylistic originality now known as &#8216;Celtic Art&#8217;. The program then traces the breakdown of Celtic society in the fifth century BC as a mass movement South of the Celtic population on the continent led to clashes with Rome and Delphi and a distribution of Celtic peoples to unexpected corners of the globe with a discussion of the great many theories that seek to explain this. The Celts in Britain are then examined in detail, with explanation of the ancient history associated with their presence there and the powerful farming, artistic and warrior traditions of their society. In tandem, the growth of the threat of the new Roman Empire to the Celts and the invasion of Celt&#8217;s new developing urban centres throughout the continent is detailed where despite the emergence of revolutionary leaders the strength of the Celts was no match for the discipline and well informed warfare techniques of the Roman soldiers.

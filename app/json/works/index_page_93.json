It was donated to ACMI by Daryl Annett.</p>\n<p>This film is a snap shot of suburban life in Melbourne. There are wonderful examples of fashion, inner-Melbourne street scenes, architecture and cars of the time. We see a children’s birthday party and backyard games under the Hills Hoist as well as neighbours chatting over the fence to passers-by in the street. Men in Australian Army and Air Force uniforms pose and smile for the camera, and there are scenes of a road trip to regional Victoria. We see a fire truck display, horse and harness riding as well as woodchopping displays at the Royal Melbourne Show. There are candid images of a horse event competitor in the stables area of the Royal Melbourne Show, as well as St Kilda Road buses and trams as they travel down the road.

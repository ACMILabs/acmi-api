The story depicts a struggle to create an Australian democracy which occurred as a result of the federation of Australian colonies in 1901. It does not glorify events or characters or avoid the more sensitive or troublesome facts of our past. It faces the hard issues of who was excluded from the rights and privileges of Australian citizenship, and thus includes the voices of women and Indigenous people who were largely ignored at the time. The tale is one of victory and loss, success, resistance and debate, and of the struggle not just to make an Australian nation, but to create a democracy. Written by Sue Castrique and narrated by John Doyle (Roy Slaven). The story is presented in 3 episodes: The Land, The People, The Nation, although each episode can stand alone.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The story of Federation is an epic tale of Australia.

Jack&#8217;s life is turned upside down when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to the &#8220;fight club&#8221;, a secret society of men who meet in underground clubs to beat the pulp out of each other. Before long Jack, under the influence of the magnetic Tyler Durden, finds himself commandeering a terrorist organisation committed to smashing the American corporate state. Based on Chuck Palahniuk&#8217;s cult novel, director David Fincher deploys a swirling, kinetic and audacious mise-en-scene to represent the fragmented and hyper-alienated psychology of contemporary American society. Though the violence in the film is extreme, &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; is a highly satirical commentary on machismo and masculine insecurity.

So this is a virulently anti-Capitalist movie financed by one of the world&#8217;s largest media multinationals; this is a feminist film that exalts in masculine aggression; this is a film that postulates that materialism has gone too far while utilising every state-of-the-art digital special effect available. It is always, however, exhilarating and provocative. Cast includes Meat Loaf, Jared Leto and Helena Bonham Carter (terrific as Jack&#8217;s resilient chain-smoking s ometimes-girlfriend, Marla).

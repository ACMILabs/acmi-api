The Beast becomes another poetic figure in Cocteau&#8217;s personal mythology, while his enchanted castle is evoked by some of the most startling imagery in cinema history - worthy of comparison with Murnau&#8217;s haunting &#8220;Nosferatu&#8221;. Cocteau&#8217;s fairytale set standards in fantasy which few other filmmakers have reached. The sequences in the enchanted castle are pure magic. Cast includes Josette Day and Jean Marais.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1804515, "name": "Andre Paulve", "creator_id": 22886, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2652721", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 773235, "name": "Jean Cocteau", "creator_id": 7140, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q83158", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36637", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1946", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1946"}], "labels": [20300], "external_references": [{"id": 1922, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q927048"}]}, {"id": 83065, "acmi_id": "304249", "title": "Beauty and the beast (Disney)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "beauty-and-the-beast-disney", "creator_credit": "Don Hahn, Walt Disney Pictures, Silver Screen Partners IV, Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1991", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This animated &#8220;tale as old as time&#8221; follows the adventures of Belle, a bright young woman imprisoned in the castle of a mysterious beast.

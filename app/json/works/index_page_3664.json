The story unfolds in the slums of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s &#8220;City of God&#8221;, a housing project built in the 1960s that becomes by the &#8216;80s a city engulfed by gang warfare. Based on a true story and a novel by Paulo Lins, young Busca-Pe (aka Rocket) grows up amongst this violence and we learn the history of the gangs through a series of stories told in flashback style with him as narrator. Rocket, through all of the horror, decides his own fate by becoming a photographer and his ability is his way out of the &#8216;City&#8217;. Gangsters, guns and violence are so accepted that they become the norm to a new and much younger generation happy to perpetuate the lifestyle learned from birth, reinforced by poverty. Nominated for four Academy Awards. In Portuguese with English subtitles.

The various parts of inner city Melbourne were originally shot on black and white negative in three colour separation, then printed on Eastmancolor film. The results are static shots of the city, where the movement of people and vehicles have a quality that is colour saturated and ghostly. This is complemented with a sountrack both urban and discordant in tone.<br />\nThis is one of a series of films made by the Cantrills that experiment with dramatic distortions of colour through three-colour separation processes. The original inspiration for this project (as the filmmakers report in the final edition of Cantrills Filmnotes) came back in the mid-1970s when Kodak stopped making the Cantrills&#8217; preferred 16mm reversal colour film stocks.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:16:01:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Social life and customs", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1169592, "name": "Corinne Cantrill", "creator_id": 11443, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1169591, "name": "Arthur Cantrill", "creator_id": 11442, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "CD-R; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film, CD-R; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "14387", "production_places": [{"id": 40, "name": "VIC/Australia", "slug": "vicaustralia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [50107]}, {"id": 66140, "acmi_id": "320380", "title": "City limits", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "city-limits", "creator_credit": "Laurence Hyde, David Bairstow and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1971", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Forthright, critical analysis of the problems of North American cities by Jane Jacobs, authority and author of books and articles on the subject.

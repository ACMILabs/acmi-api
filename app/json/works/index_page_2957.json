After terrorists try to destroy the city, special SWAT teams are called in to try and neutralise the situation. Terrorist AJ Sebastian manages to escape from police custody by murdering an officer. Horrified by what has occurred, police offider Dunan Nats and her cyborg partner, Buliaros Hekatonecles, transfer to investigations in order to hunt down and arrest him, before he has the chance to destroy Olympus. A fast-paced anime, filled with heavy weaponry, fascinating mecha, and enough references to characters and places in Greek mythology for the viewer to get a clear sense of the underlying concerns of this animation. This film is based on an original story by Masamune Shirow, who published the first book in the Appleseed series &#8220;The Promethean Challenge&#8221;, in 1985. In 1986, the Appleseed books won him the Galaxy Award for the best sci-fi manga. In general, Shirow&#8217;s inspiration derives from reading extensively, particularly in the areas of science, medicine, the supernatural, military strategy, biology, nanotechnology, and mythology, which is particularly apparent in Appleseed.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:08:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Manga", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Manga", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Literature&nbsp;→ Japanese literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Cyborgs", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2098514, "name": "Kazuyoshi Katayama", "creator_id": 32579, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6381790", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098508, "name": "Atsushi Sugita", "creator_id": 79461, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036198", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098512, "name": "Masaki Sawanobori", "creator_id": 77984, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079466", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098506, "name": "Taro Maki", "creator_id": 79460, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036559", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098505, "name": "Manga Entertainment", "creator_id": 27485, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4902765", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2098500, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48290", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [30460]}, {"id": 94078, "acmi_id": "317850", "title": "Antz [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "antz-dvd", "creator_credit": "Eric Darnell, Tim Johnson, Aron Warner, Brad Lewis, Patty Wooton, NBCUniversal and PDI Group", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 48434, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q610502"}], "brief_description": "<p>This dazzling computer animated comedy uses with great comic effect the neurotic persona of Woody Allen in order to tell the story of Z (Allen), a down trodden worker ant struggling to assert his individuality amongst the conformity of the ant colony.

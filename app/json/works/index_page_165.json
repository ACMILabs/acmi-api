Not long after, Stu Pickles receives an emergency call to travel to Europetarland, France, to repair a faulty Raptor and pacify rampaging theme park director, Coco LaBouche. He&#8217;s invited to bring family and friends for company and the Rugrats find themselves in Paris. In an effort to gain a promotion and become company president, the child hating Coco makes a play for Chuckie&#8217;s hapless father Chas in a desperate attempt to win favour with the outgoing President. Only Angelica knows of Coco&#8217;s cunning plan and it&#8217;s up to the Rugrats to save Chas, imperilling a few famous landmarks along the way.

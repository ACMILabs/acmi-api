With ambitious battle scenes and stupendous set pieces, this grand and masterful cinematic spectacle kept most viewers utterly enthralled, whilst earning Jackson almost universal praise for capturing Tolkien&#8217;s mythopoeic narrative and elegiac tone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Battles", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 73}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/lord-of-the-rings-i-the-fellowship-of-the-ring", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1976064, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976063, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976062, "name": "Fran Walsh", "creator_id": 72165, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976061, "name": "Tim Sanders", "creator_id": 59572, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976060, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976059, "name": "Wingnut Films", "creator_id": 31880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1976058, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51773", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33425], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93885, "acmi_id": "317639", "title": "Casino royale", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "casino-royale", "creator_credit": "Robert Parrish, Joseph McGrath, Ken Hughes, Val Guest, John Huston, Jerry Bresler, Charles K.

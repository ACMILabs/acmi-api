Clips from films and television programs are used as illustrations. &#8220;From Lucian to Jules Verne&#8221; traces the beginnings of science fiction in social satire and criticism with the works of Lucian, Thomas More and Swift until Jules Verne revived the genre by tapping into scientific possibilities. &#8220;From H. G. Wells to George Orwell&#8221; shows how H. G. Wells linked the old and the new science fiction writers, who developed the space opera, magazines, and the science fiction film, culminating in Orwell&#8217;s grim visions of the future. &#8220;From Isaac Asimov to Arthur C. Clarke&#8221; documents the influences of outside factors such as World War II, the cold war, Vietnam and the hippy experience of the 60&#8217;s in the works of Asimov, Heinlein, Herbert and Clarke.

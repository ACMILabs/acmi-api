But despite these settler interventions, the beauty and grandeur of Country prospers, captured through wide vistas and intimate close-ups of the landscape. Both Sen and Collins won an AACTA award for Best Director and Best Cinematography respectively.</p>\n<p>Beneath Clouds and other narrative titles are juxtaposed with archival historical films about Australian road building. These Government-made promotional films of the 1950s and 60s were used to build support for ‘nation building’ and were released during the same period First Peoples gained the right to vote in 1962. These are included in Beneath Roads to highlight the lack of awareness of centuries-old Indigenous navigation and travel routes upon which many modern roads were built.</p>\n<p>Beneath Roads further counters this lack of awareness by including footage of the Southern Warriors, a Victorian Aboriginal motorcycle club. On Survival Day in 2024, the Southern Warriors rode to Coranderrk mission to honour Wurundjeri activist William Barak’s historic protest walks from Coranderrk to Melbourne, during which Barak advocated for the mission and his people’s rights. Historically First Peoples’ ability to travel was restricted by systemic racism and discriminatory government policies that pervaded Australia until the 1970s. The Southern Warriors stand in stark contrast to this history, representing a sense of freedom, safety and pride for Indigenous communities. Impossible to ignore, the self-described ‘warriors’ travel the state Black, loud and proud.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:09:07:00"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["9 min 7 sec"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Digital"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["mutli-channel video with sound"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2590822, "name": "Jenna Warwick", "creator_id": 87594, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2590824, "name": "Rah Dakota", "creator_id": 87595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2590823, "name": "Field Carr", "creator_id": 10805, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "196019", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2024", "notes": "", "to_year": "2024"}], "labels": [62073]}, {"id": 125196, "acmi_id": "", "title": "What is solarpunk?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "solarpunk-what-is-it", "creator_credit": "Dami Lee", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "NOV 2023", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Screen recording of @damileearch's TikTok stream", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This viral TikTok video is one of the best crash courses on solarpunk out there.

It marks the beginning of Vorhaus&#8217; association with Twickenham Studios. The film announces to the world a director with ideas of his own by kicking off with what may well be the first-ever pre-credit sequence. And it does exactly what a good pre-credit sequence should do: sets up the premise of the film, establishes the mood and piques our curiosity. It is worth recalling that 1933 audiences would most likely have had no advance knowledge of what they were about to see. Few people would trouble to enquire about the supporting feature beforehand, and might not even notice the title. By boldly setting up the mystery in this way, Vorhaus hoped to hold his audience&#8217;s attention through an hour or so of Fowler Mear&#8217;s lumbering banter. Cast includes Henry Kendall, Ida Lupino and John Mills.

No risible Hornby-Double-O model shots, either: the trains are very much for real.

During its runaway course, the train twice barrels at full lick through a station where it is supposed to stop, to the alarm of the passengers and railway official alike.

This violent film, typical of Peckinpah, relentlessly depicts ruthless robbery and murder, not to mention adultery, kidnapping, bribery, extortion and general mayhem. No-one in this film is honourable or attractive, and yet the viewer finds themself actually hoping that McQueen and MacGraw, thieves though they are, will get away. Cast includes: Steve McQueen, Ali MacGraw, Ben Johnson, Sally Struthers, Al Lettieri and Slim Pickens.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Extortion", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956657, "name": "First Artists", "creator_id": 29870, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956658, "name": "David Foster", "creator_id": 70796, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956659, "name": "Mitchell Brower", "creator_id": 78673, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956660, "name": "Sam Peckinpah", "creator_id": 26583, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956656, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44427", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [27324]}]}

Charles works hard but fails his exams, Paul doesn&#8217;t but passes and gets Charles&#8217;s girl. Chabrol&#8217;s second feature film re-unites Jean-Claude Brialy and Gerard Blain, the two lead actors from his debut feature, &#8216;Le Beau Serge&#8217;. Paul (Brialy) is a hedonistic and confident Parisian student living in his uncle&#8217;s fashionable inner city flat. He spends his time drinking, carousing, sleeping with a variety of female friends and playing the role of matchmaker for his friends, arranging trysts in an ongoing merry go round of bed partners. He is an emotionally remote and decadent man, adhering to a dubious moral code, who approaches his friends love lives with devilish detachment. Charles (Blain) is his naive country cousin, a dedicated student, who stays with Paul whilst studying for his law exams. When Charles is introduced to Paul&#8217;s swinging set, he instantaneously falls for Florence, a beautiful woman who is intrigued by Charles&#8217; innocence. Paul is perturbed as he observes the attraction between the two and the respect that Charles displays for Florence. A clash is inevitable as the rivalry for Florences affection grows. The contrast between the two main characters morality is acute, especially in their attitudes toward women. A dramatic study of class conflict and personal responsibility &#8216;Les Cousins&#8217; is a riveting and perverse study of decadent Parisian student life.

Rather than being a sweeping epic, this film examines the fight of a small group of Protestants for survival in the mountainous Cevennes region. Some of the story is told using excerpts from the diary kept by an actual participant in the conflict. The movie is notable for its period authenticity and historical accuracy.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Rene Allio ; writers, Jean Jourdheuil, Rene Allio ; photography, Denys Clairval ; music, Philippe Arthuys.<br />\nCast: Francois Marthouret, Dominique Labourier, Rufus, Isabelle Sadoyan, Jacques Debary, Genevieve Mnich, Maurice Benichou, Suzy Rambaud, Jean Benguigui, Christine Laurent.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890676, "name": "Rene Allio", "creator_id": 82966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146784", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [55554]}, {"id": 116239, "acmi_id": "X000441", "title": "Les Bonnes Femmes = the Good Girls", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "les-bonnes-femmes-the-good-girls", "creator_credit": "Robert Hakim, Raymond Hakim and Claude Chabrol", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Four shop girls long to escape the monotony of their existence: Ginette sings in a tatty music-hall; Rita drifts into a bourgeois marriage; Jane simply wants a good time; Jacqueline yearns for romantic love but is strangled by a maniac.

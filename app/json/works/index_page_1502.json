With the help of a plastic surgeon and a psychoanalyst, he is &#8216;restored&#8217; to an identity that was never his, Vincent&#8217;s. As Clay, now Vincent, begins to enjoy a new lease on life and new identity, he realises that he is suspected of murder. What may seem like a standard thriller is given a subversive spin by having Clay played by a black actor and Vincent by a white actor and having no-one during the course of the film commenting on it. The film explores the concept of personal and racial identity as well as that of social construct with a great sense of irony. Stephen Soderbergh was the film&#8217;s executive producer. Cast includes Dennis Haysbert, Michael Harris, Mel Harris, Sab Shimono and Dina Merrill.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sundance Film Festival - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amnesia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Twins"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962886, "name": "Kino-Korsakoff", "creator_id": 35561, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962887, "name": "Scott McGehee", "creator_id": 80430, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962888, "name": "David Siegel", "creator_id": 80431, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962885, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51357", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [33201]}]}

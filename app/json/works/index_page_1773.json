The girls go about ruining the imposed decision that they merge with the boys at St Ambrose by sabotaging the school dance and becoming politically active, much to the pleasure of the strict but approachable headmistress (Lynn Redgrave). At Miss Godard&#8217;s School for Girls this coming-of-age tale is full of sass and toe-tapping fun. Written and directed by Sarah Kernochan. Cast includes: Kirsten Dunst, Gaby Hoffman, Rachel Leigh Cook, Vincent Kartheiser, Monica Keena, Heather Matarazzo, and Merritt Wever.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Boarding schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School discipline", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Women - Education", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Conduct of life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Eating disorders", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Conduct of life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Girls - Societies and clubs"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2353557, "name": "Sarah Kernochan", "creator_id": 81189, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2224404", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353550, "name": "Ira Deutchman", "creator_id": 81188, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086039", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353554, "name": "Peter Newman", "creator_id": 78164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079003", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353541, "name": "Alliance Communications", "creator_id": 26863, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357577", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2353544, "name": "Redeemable Features", "creator_id": 30495, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315569", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2353537, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53167", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [34611]}, {"id": 95104, "acmi_id": "319151", "title": "Sample people", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sample-people-dvd", "creator_credit": "Clinton Smith, Barton Smith, Emile Sherman, Living Motion Pictures and South Australian Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46147, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2586958"}], "brief_description": "<p>Phil&#8217;s falafel shop is where it all goes down - some peoples&#8217; lives culminate in a single defining moment and how they all get to that point over a forty-eight hour period is the storyline.

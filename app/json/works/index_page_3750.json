When his best friend dies of leukemia, Jim&#8217;s life suddenly becomes much more than adolescent angst, with him making the dark descent into the hell of heroin addiction and hustling. Jim&#8217;s poetry is the only thing he has left when he is found, literally on the street, by a tough ex-junkie, who undertakes his rehabilitation.

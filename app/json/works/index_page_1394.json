She can hardly take off on her broomstick. She can&#8217;t say spells in a scary voice. She can&#8217;t even cackle. Worst of all, she is afraid of witches - older, bossy, mean witches like her two older sisters. Always feeling left out, afraid of the dark, afraid of witches, Wendy goes to bed at night hugging her broomstick, which at least gives her a little witch power&#8230;until the day before Halloween, when she loses it! Now she has no witch power at all. Left alone on Halloween night, Wendy meets a friend and magically discovers special powers that she has always desired. At first, she uses the spells to seek revenge, but soon she realises her folly, takes off the spells, and earns the sought-after respect and love of her sisters. Based on book by Alice Low. Narrated by Kathryn Walker. Voices by Denise Lute, Diane Salinger, Eliot Noyes.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The youngest witch in her family, Wendy has the weakest witch power.

As the wheel turned, the reflections of the pictures appeared stationary. This Praxinoscope theatre was a development of Reynaud’s earlier Praxinoscope. This version had a glass viewing screen which reflected one of a range of printed scenes placed below the viewing aperture on the inside of the lid. Looking through this aperture, the viewer sees the moving figure reflected on the mirror drum which appears to be superimposed on the printed scene.&#8221;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Praxinoscope Théâtre</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>France, c. 1889-1900</p>", "description": "<p>AEO177313 Praxinoscope Theatre contained within a hinged wooden box, when opened box forms the base for theatres installation through: a wooden spindle screwed into the base, a spinning cylinder (inner area lined with mirrors) inserted into spindle and a candle holder with a paper shade on top inserted into cylinder.

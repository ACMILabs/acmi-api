By placing actors such as Caine, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings in a film about aging, death and grief, Schepisi also creates a loving memorial to the golden age of British cinema - the tough working class films of the early sixties which smashed the genteel pretensions of an earlier British cinema (though gentility was to arise again in the period dramas which now form the backbone of British television). &#8220;Last Orders&#8221; is based on the award winning novel by Graham Swift.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Effortlessly moving between World War II and contemporary London, &#8220;Last Orders&#8221; is a film about friendship, honour and familial ties.

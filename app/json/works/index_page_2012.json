Despite the best efforts of the oppressed poor to rebel, the aristocratic Tang family have colluded yet again with foreign devils to sell its people like cattle. But after being forced aboard a vessel bound for Sydney, the soon-to-be slaves finally recognise they must put aside their differences and work together to liberate themselves from foreign oppression.</p>\n<p>It is the 1850s, they have struck gold in Australia, and Chinese corpses are floating in the sea. Qichang&#8217;s boat is out looking for survivors. But a huge steamboat commanded by devilish foreigners storms over them, destroying their boat. The foreign vessel is captained by a certain Lord William (played by a Chinese actor), who has arrived in China on the orders of his superior to recruit workers for the mines in Australia, where they are digging it up in chunks. Lord William needs 500 coolies to go to Sydney, and has only 15 days to do it in.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the sole survivor of the junk boat is Yankun, the clerk from the Shengji Company. He seems to have been traumatised and when an old man starts lighting his pipe the survivor totally freaks out, exclaiming &#8220;We were all burned alive!&#8221; From then on he runs out of the house and begins raving down the streets. Eventually he is recognised by his wife and daughter. Yankun&#8217;s wife goes for help but is weylaid by two rascals and saved just in the nick of time by the film&#8217;s hero, Jinlong. In doing this benevolent deed, however, Jinlong earns the wrath of the local heavies.</p>\n<p>Pan Rufei is called in to the office of the foreigners.Meanwhile Pan Rufei is introduced to foreigners. They discuss their plans.Fly Shark anchored in Xiamen, Pan explains theyve already sent 6000 coolies, impossible to get 500 in such a short period.</p>\n<p>The working classes can stand no more and sentiments of rebellion have begun to ferment. They make the ritual sacrifice of cock&#8217;s blood in alcohol and all drink to rise up against the Tang aristocrats. However the Tang businessmen have recruited a gang of ninjas, who rock up to the workers&#8217; secret meeting and abduct everyone. Within seconds, hundreds of ninjas have converged on the household. But all is not lost yet, as our hero Jinlong arrives on the scene and single-handedly fights them all off.</p>\n<p>He tries to avenge those abducted but is saved by a girl named Shichun who loves him for the hero that he is. She tells the tragic story of her life: A young fisherman&#8217;s daughter who is sold to a brothel at 15. After one day finding a man to marry he immediately dies, leaving her all alone without anyone in the world. Though she &#8220;forces herself to smile every day, she must swallow her tears every night&#8221;.

Xiaoxia fell in love with a handsome actor, Song Danping, a few years ago but the proposed marriage was strongly opposed by Xiaoxia&#8217;s father, who asked Xiaoxia&#8217;s cousin, Tang to murder Xiaoxia&#8217;s lover, Song. Song escaped Tang&#8217;s murder but was disfigured by vitriol. Song committed suicide by drowning himself in a river and everybody believed he was dead. Song&#8217;s death drove Xiaoxia mad, but in fact Song didn&#8217;t die. Xiao&#8217;ou felt so sorrowful for the couple and one day he ran across Song, who passed him a script, asking Xiao&#8217;ou to sing the opera for him and save Xiaoxia. Xiao&#8217;ou singing awakes Xiaoxia, who learns that Song is still alive. Song refuses to see Xiaoxia as his face is completely distorted and covered by a mask. Xiaoxia blinds her eyes in order to be with Song. Now Xiaoxia is blind, Tang wants to get Xiao&#8217;ou&#8217;s girlfriend, Lü Die. However, Tang killed Lü Die accidentally before Song turns up to save her. Tang escaped and incited the crowds to kill the &#8220;ghost&#8221;, Song.

Where the parents&#8217; generation have many children, they have all dispersed to the far reaches of their China for work and study. As each member arrives for the ritual homecoming in order to pass the Spring Festival, we are invited to relive the same dramas and encounters that take place each year at this time.</p>\n<p>The films starts in the snow at a new year market, bustling with life and a general festive mood. An old lady carefully unfolds money from handkerchief to buy an article from one of the many stands selling sweets, balloons, lanterns and all manner of cards with foods and treats. The old woman is accosted by two friendly performers of Xiangsheng (comedians that use wordplay) wanting money. She has to pay them off to get past and they give her a Zitie (calligraphy of sayings that are stuck around the door around New Years).</p>\n<p>Money is very scarce for her family, but she is very happy to see her husband, an old man who sleds down a snowy hill on his rocking chair. Though it is the tradition, neither one expects their children to return home to pay their respects and pass the days celebrating. In fact, they don&#8217;t seem to mind when they remember all the havoc that eventuates around this time of the year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re better off without them&#8221;, they say, but we can tell that they are sad to hear themselves say such things.</p>\n<p>When they are back home, the old man gives his wife a shock by pulling down his pants and unsheathing a huge pile of cash. When he gives it all to her she begins to weep, crying &#8220;I haven&#8217;t suffered you in vain!&#8221;</p>\n<p>The old man jokes: &#8220;You cry if you&#8217;re poor, you cry if you&#8217;re rich!&#8221; All they have is each other, and they envision a quiet and peaceful Spring Festival. The man performs moxibustion on the old woman, buys fireworks and prepares the dumplings.</p>\n<p>However, it isn&#8217;t long before their entire family and their spouses arrive. It turns out that all their children are preparing to marry powerful families and need plenty of money to organise weddings, go on study tours and bail themselves out of assorted mischief. Everything manages to pass without major conflict until that night.</p>\n<p>While a simple list would not do the film true justice, we gain an extremely realistic view of the average northern Chinese family. We watch the intricate dynamics play out as the family is forced to deal with all the issues which are often tabooed to those outside the inner circle of immediate relatives.

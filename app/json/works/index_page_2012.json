With the most economic of means, Ramsay immediately immerses the audience in the textures and sounds of 1970s Glasgow. Most importantly, without didactism, without bombast, she eloquently gives voice to the immensity of suffering bought on by poverty; and moves us with a poignant testament to the dignity of human struggle.

Discovered and threatened with destruction, Remy teams up with the hapless garbage-boy, Linguini, to create the best food in Paris (and therefore, of course, the best food in the world!).

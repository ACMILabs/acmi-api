When a hunting accident occurs in his township, Wade suspects murder and sees an opportunity to make a hero of himself and finally receive the respect of both his daughter and his father.

The bleakness of Wade&#8217;s life is rooted in the history of his parent&#8217;s relationship and even the counseling of his sympathetic girlfriend (Sissy Spacek), and his estranged brother (Willem Dafoe) cannot offer him any hope.

Director Spike Jonze, whose background is in music video&#8217;s (Beastie Boy&#8217;s &#8220;Sabotage&#8221; and Fat Boy Slim&#8217;s &#8220;Praise You&#8221; just to name a few) has opted to treat the film&#8217;s insane subject matter in the most matter of fact way. The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman explores every possibility that this existential conundrum evokes, at turns managing to be hilarious, weird and melancholy. Cast also includes Mary Kay Place, Charlie Sheen and Orson Bean.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "German", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Puppet making", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Puppet theater", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Puppeteers"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/being-john-malkovich", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2111092, "name": "Spike Jonze", "creator_id": 79824, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q259913", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111087, "name": "Michael Stipe", "creator_id": 79821, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q215182", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111088, "name": "Sandy Stern", "creator_id": 79822, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7417486", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111090, "name": "Steve Golin", "creator_id": 68280, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7612676", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111091, "name": "Vincent Landay", "creator_id": 79823, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7931899", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111084, "name": "PolyGram", "creator_id": 26548, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111086, "name": "Propaganda Films", "creator_id": 4061, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2111081, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49925", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [31945]}, {"id": 92453, "acmi_id": "315733", "title": "L.A. confidential [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-confidential-dvd", "creator_credit": "Curtis Hanson, Arnon Milchan, Michael Nathanson and Regency Enterprises", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45056, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q339876"}], "brief_description": "<p>Based on a James Ellroy novel, &#8216;L.A.

In fact, it was conceived well before the beginning of the war and has a short story by Leo Tolstoy, &#8216;Prisoner of the Caucasus&#8217;, as its basis. As the war rages in the Caucasus, young recruit Vania (Sergei Bodrov, Jr.) is sent off to the front, where he befriends a wily and experienced soldier, Sasha (Oleg Menshikov). During an ambush, the pair is captured by Muslims forces and taken prisoner to a mountain village. The leader - Abdel Murat (Djemal Sikharulidze), intends to use the soldiers as exchange currency against his son, held prisoner by the Russian army. As their stay in the village extends, a mutual understanding develops between Vania and Abdel Murat as well as a tender friendship with his daughter. However, Sasha plots to use this new found understanding as a means for achieving freedom. &#8216;Prisoner of the Mountains&#8217; is a powerful anti-war fable exploring the universal themes of human friendship overcoming, for a luminous moment, the barriers of language, religion, culture and other physical and mental borders. Filmed on location in Daghestan, &#8216;Prisoner of the Mountains&#8217; was cast mostly with local villager. This visual feast set among stunning mountainous landscape garnered a scoop of awards and nominations, including Best Foreign Film Oscar Nomination (1996) and the Cannes Film Festival Award (1996).

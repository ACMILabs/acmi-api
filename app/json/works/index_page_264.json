Cast also includes Gareth Hunt, Don Warrington, John Fortune, Sheila Steafel, John Stephen Hill, Cleo Rocos and Graham Stark.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Parody", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mass murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Satanism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/bloodbath-at-the-house-of-death", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960999, "name": "Wildwood Productions", "creator_id": 34344, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961000, "name": "Ray Cameron", "creator_id": 79927, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960998, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50173", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [32169], "external_references": [{"id": 2180, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4733"}, {"id": 3659, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "52528"}]}]}

Overwhelmed by the chance of success, he overlooks critical factors looming in the wings, including a player who can&#8217;t act, a leading lady wanting to steal the spotlight, a leading man who is a compulsive eater and the gangster&#8217;s bodygaurd who wants to rewrite the play. Set in the 1920&#8217;s, Woody Allen&#8217;s film is enhanced by an excellent atmospheric soundtrack. The cast includes John Cusack, Mary-Louise Parker, Jennifer Tilly, Tracey Ullman, and Academy Award winner Dianne Wiest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/bullets-over-broadway", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954417, "name": "Magnolia Productions", "creator_id": 27594, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954418, "name": "Sweetland Films BV", "creator_id": 27595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954419, "name": "Robert Greenhut", "creator_id": 46855, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954420, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954416, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41583", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [25076], "external_references": [{"id": 484, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1004531"}, {"id": 3724, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11382"}]}, {"id": 86880, "acmi_id": "308592", "title": "Bull Durham", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bull-durham", "creator_credit": "Mount Company, Thom Mount, Mark Burg and Ron Shelton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins turn in seriously sexy performances in this sensational baseball comedy.

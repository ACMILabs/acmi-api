The Hitchcock template for this film is &#8220;Rear window&#8221; and &#8220;Vertigo&#8221;, perversely reworked into a lurid, violent thriller which proudly wears all it&#8217;s sleazy excesses on its sleeve. Craig Wassen plays Jake, a down on his luck actor who has just been fired from a shlock Z-grade vampire film due to his claustrophobia, a problem considering he spends several scenes inside a coffin. Dumped by his girlfriend and evicted from his flat, Jake finds himself homeless until a fellow actor (Gregg Henry) suggests he temporarily house-sit a rich record producer&#8217;s house.

The young boy, Shepard (Songololo to his grandmother), who likes to do things slowly, is enlisted by his grandmother Gogo to assist her on a shopping trip to the city. She is an old woman, not quite in step with modern technology, no longer moving quickly. Love, respect and humour flow between the two. The boy&#8217;s hand-me-down sneakers are worn out and although he doesn&#8217;t ask for them, Songololo&#8217;s desire for a new pair is evident by his dreamy-eyed window-shopping. Gogo, after observing his behaviour and the condition of his sneakers, makes this day very special by buying him a bright red pair.

It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to Bangkok, Thailand visiting temples and then on to Burma (Myanmar) showing the grandeur of Shwedagon Pagoda, Rangoon (Yangon). He also visits Singapore and Calcutta Madras.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:04:00 passengers enjoying the sun, sitting on deckchairs drinking tea or coffee on board ship<br />\n00:00:02:00 a sunset scene<br />\n00:00:50:00 a bay setting with views of a village, temples, spires and bells<br />\n00:02:30:00 close ups of dramatic looking spires<br />\n00:03:07:00 pagodas, rooftops, a river and temples<br />\n00:03:45:00 a lone monk looking at the camera<br />\n00:04:10:00 a monk poses outside a temple and walks toward the camera<br />\n00:04:30:00 river scenes including a lovely walk bridge<br />\n00:04:55:00 views of a public garden<br />\n00:04:59:00 airplane on the tarmac<br />\n00:05:05:00 clouds being filmed from inside a plane<br />\n00:05:17:00 camera films scenes looking down at houses from a plane<br />\n00:05:47:00 busy street scene<br />\n00:05:50:00 views of the grand Shwedagon Pagoda in Myanmar (Burma) from different angles<br />\n00:06:54:00 a white, colonial style government building with a statue of a military person mounted on a horse<br />\n00:07:25:00 steam train<br />\n00:07:34:00 beach scenes<br />\n00:07:50:00 views of the countryside<br />\n00:07:55:00 a clocktower<br />\n00:08:17:00 a &#8216;dhow&#8217; sailboat with a wonderful large sail<br />\n00:08:36:00 a long, large traditional boat on the sand at a beach<br />\n00:09:34:00 riverbank scenes<br />\n00:09:38:00 passenger ship and military ships in a bay as well as a carrier with a helicopter taking off from the deck<br />\n00:10:20:00 tourist buses<br />\n00:10:30:00 cars in city streets and shady trees in the street<br />\n00:10:47:00 large cathedral<br />\n00:10:55:00 great view of ship between buildings at the end of a street.<br />\n00:11:06:00 passenger ship in a dock area<br />\n00:11:43:00 views taken from a deck on board ship whilst coming into dock.

It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia.

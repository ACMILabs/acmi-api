Archival &#8216;evidence&#8217; of its damaging effects is provided from &#8220;dope&#8221; flicks such as &#8220;High on the range &#8221; and &#8220;Reefer madness&#8221;, police training films, newsreel footage, Movietone News and media campaigns.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nixon, Richard M.

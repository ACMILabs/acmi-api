Using Leo&#8217;s (Kevin McKidd) 30th birthday bash as a basis, the film traces Leo&#8217;s relationship to the guests; gay room mate Darren (Tom Hollander) and his real estate agent boyfriend (Hugo Weaving) with a penchant for using the bedrooms of the houses he&#8217;s selling for their trysts; straight and single friend Angie (Julie Graham); new Age guru and leader of Leo&#8217;s men&#8217;s group, Keith (Simon Callow); Leo&#8217;s previous boyfriend, Brendan (James Purefoy) and Brendan&#8217;s current girlfriend, Sally (Jennifer Ehle), who also happens to be Leo&#8217;s high school sweetheart. Central to the film are the gatherings of the men&#8217;s group for masculine assertiveness and when Leo admits his attraction to seemingly straight, Irishman Brendan, it opens the floodgates for other members of the group with surprising results.

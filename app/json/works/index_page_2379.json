Watching &#8220;Punch-drunk love&#8221; you find a mix of dark humour and seedy characters, coupled with violent behaviour and social dysfunction - but it&#8217;s also a romance with colour, mood and music that carries you along and makes you hope for a happy ending. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, winner of Best Director 2002 Cannes Film Festival for this disquieting film. Cast includes Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "English", "English", "English", "Hungarian", "Russian", "Russian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Extortion", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Telephone sex", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964713, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964714, "name": "Revolution Studios", "creator_id": 72141, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964715, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964716, "name": "Joanne Sellar", "creator_id": 80205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964717, "name": "Daniel Lupi", "creator_id": 43834, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964718, "name": "Paul Thomas Anderson", "creator_id": 43829, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964719, "name": "Paul Thomas Anderson", "creator_id": 43829, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964712, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52931", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34386]}, {"id": 86482, "acmi_id": "308163", "title": "Pumping iron", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "pumping-iron", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Witness the movie that brought attention to Arnold Schwarzenegger.

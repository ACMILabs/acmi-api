Enlisting performances that essentially carry the narrative, Ozon&#8217;s preference for films dealing with psychological manipulation is evident with this film. Sarah Morton (Rampling) is an English crime writer who jaded by her monetary success and fame seeks out her publisher John Bosload (Charles Dance) and a morning whiskey to help cheer her up. He suggests she uses his holiday house in France for a break and possibly some inspiration for her next novel in a detective series she has been writing. Her time in France seems to be just what she needs, until a visit by Bosload&#8217;s estranged daughter Julie (Sagnier) throws her staid and orderly self into disarray. Sexually provocative and physically beautiful, Julie becomes her new fascination and the two women form a bond when murder and muse become intertwined in their summer idyll by the swimming pool.

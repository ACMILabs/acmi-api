The details of his artistic interests in natural history made strange, that is, the confusion of disparate beings and objects in nature through mind and poetic associations, are discussed in terms of his public work as well as that undertaken in more personal spaces such as murals in friends houses and sculptures and exterior murals adorning his own various residences.

In the 1950s, his return to Europe was met with little recognition, but following the receipt of the Grand Prix of Venice in 1954, his acclaim saw an establishment of his freedom to experiment with his progression of interests in painting and sculpture once again. The program closes with an analysis of his work at this stage where his final settlement in the &#8216;Garden of France&#8217; with Dorothea is discussed with reference to the hopeful nuances of his later series of paintings that studied the idea of the cage, and most symbolically, an empty cage from which a bird had escaped.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Max Ernst</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Peter Schamoni, RM Arts and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Germany, 1991</p>", "description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Phaidon art collection&#8221;.<br />\nTraces the history of renowned painter and sculptor, Max Ernst, his personal life as well as artistic career.

At the commencement of the war, a trying era began for Ernst of imprisonments at various stages in France for his German citizenship and as a result of false accusations, spending a few months in a concentration camp, which led to his subsequent difficult, but finally successful move to America with the help of colleague and third wife Peggy Guggenheim and the New York art scene. Here the program details his first Surrealist Exhibition in New York and his invention of what is now known as action painting, all received with great critical acclaim, and his following career in New York, during which time he married the painter, Dorothea Tanning. Their move to Arizona, to live and work in a &#8216;landscape of the minds eye&#8217; signalled a time of detachment from many of his peers and a fascination with Native American culture and crafts and the rythms of the landscape that he had painted before seeing and that manifested a great influence in his works of the time. In the 1950s, his return to Europe was met with little recognition, but following the receipt of the Grand Prix of Venice in 1954, his acclaim saw an establishment of his freedom to experiment with his progression of interests in painting and sculpture once again. The program closes with an analysis of his work at this stage where his final settlement in the &#8216;Garden of France&#8217; with Dorothea is discussed with reference to the hopeful nuances of his later series of paintings that studied the idea of the cage, and most symbolically, an empty cage from which a bird had escaped.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration",

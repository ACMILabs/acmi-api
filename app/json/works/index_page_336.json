The libretto for Voss has been distilled by David Malouf from Patrick White&#8217;s great craggy novel of 1957. The result is a long dramatic poem which captures to perfection the essence of the novel. It has inspired in Richard Meale, music which reaches passionate and elemental power. Features: Geoffrey Chaird, Marilyn Richardson, The Australian Opera Chorus and the State Orchestra of Victoria conducted by Stuart Challender.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Opera  -  Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 898992, "name": "Peter Butler", "creator_id": 21966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898993, "name": "Jim Sharman", "creator_id": 76469, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 898991, "name": "Video Classroom", "creator_id": 20016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35281", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [18959], "external_references": []}]}

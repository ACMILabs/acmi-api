He gets a new lease on life, however, when he meets and falls in love with Sarah (Louise Goodall), a healthcare worker.

Loach&#8217;s film combines a razor-sharp portrayal of unemployed and working-class life in Glasgow with strong doses of melodrama. Clearly &#8216;leftist&#8217; in his concerns, Loach reveals the limited options available to those living in a world dominated by a closed circuit of unemployment, substance abuse and crime. The possibility of breaking free of this circuit lies in the character, Joe, whose redemption however comes at a high price. In a manner reminiscent of Nicholas Ray, Loach dramatises the intense rhapsody and sheer desperation of gaining and losing a sense of humanity. &#8220;My Name is Joe&#8221; is both poignant melodrama and stirring political realism.

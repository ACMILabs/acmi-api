Writer and sociologist Terry Williams befriended the group, provided them with notebooks and video cameras and sent them out to make an autobiography of the city of Harlem and its community through their eyes and in their words. Each person views their life and Harlem from a different perspective providing the positive as well as the negative such as 18 year-old Jermaine (architect student) who is concerned about the thousands of abandoned buildings, turning his anger and frustration into determination and positive action; 12 year-old Amir (actor), star of theatre, commercials and TV soapies, brought up in a privileged environment but still managing to keep his feet on the ground; 17 year-old Barr Elliot &#8220;Star Dragon&#8221; (hip-hop singer) who directed his &#8220;kill or be killed&#8221; mentality into music and the dream of being successful one day; and 18 year-old Nikki Matos (teenage mother) who, surrounded by the ethos of violence and killing among young black males, is determined to create a better life for her young son. Most of the group come from single parent families, some from violent backgrounds, but their resilience and determination to overcome their circumstances is truly inspiring. Gritty and at times disturbing, revealing the dark world of drugs, poverty and violence, &#8220;Harlem diary&#8221; also engenders a sense of dignity, humour, passion and hope by these nine thoughtful young people.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Harlem (New York, N.Y.)", "Biographical", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environment - Social aspects", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Drug abuse - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Environment - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Minorities - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social justice", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social problems", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social values", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Sociology, Urban", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alienation (Social psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse - Social aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "History&nbsp;→ African Americans - History", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Places&nbsp;→ Harlem (New York, N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 916118, "name": "Discovery Channel", "creator_id": 46799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916119, "name": "Gabriel Films", "creator_id": 80885, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916120, "name": "Jonathan Stack", "creator_id": 80886, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916121, "name": "Terry Williams", "creator_id": 80887, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916122, "name": "Mary Beth Mann", "creator_id": 80888, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916123, "name": "Jonathan Stack", "creator_id": 80886, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916124, "name": "Spencer Style", "creator_id": 78484, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

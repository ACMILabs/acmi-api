He hands her a kebab and she leaves. During their lunch break, Xiao Biao asks Haizi if he likes Dongjia.

Xiao Biao encourages him to ask her out.</p>\n<p>Haizi is sent to deliver a package to the mysterious woman, Wu Xuejie. When she acts arrogantly, Haizi leaves in embarrassment. He asks Xiao Biao to deliver the package instead, but he refuses, admitting how nervous he feels in her presence. Xiao explains to Haizi that Wu Xuejie tried to kill herself after a lover used her for her father&#8217;s money and connections. Meanwhile, Dongjia befriends Haizi&#8217;s sister.</p>\n<p>Haizi confronts his father about his new job working at the kebab store and admits he wants to quit his job as a postman.

When Wu Xiujie was admitted into university and Xiao Biao was not, he was ashamed of his failure and never saw her again. They vow to reunite the couple. They write at letter to Wu Xiujie, begging her forgiveness.</p>\n<p>When Haizi delivers mail to Wu Xiujie&#8217;s apartment some time later, she approaches him, apologises for her rudeness on his first visit, and invites him inside for a drink.

Exhausted by the stress, Haizi&#8217;s father comes to Xiao Biao&#8217;s house, begging him to return his son. Observing the effect of his friendship with Haizi on his family, Xiao Biao forces Haizi to return home and reunite with his family.</p>\n<p>Days later, Xiao Biao and Dongjia sit down to their last meal together, Xiao Biao having finally been accepted into college. As they wait for Haizi, Dongjia she has feelings for him and asks her brother for advice. She convinces her brother to find Wu Xiujie and tell her that he has finally been accepted into college.</p>\n<p>Xiao Biao writes a letter to Wu Xiujie, explaining everything. Dongjia finds Haizi, reassuring him that despite failures he is a good man. They vow to love and care for one another, kiss, and (literally) walk off into the sunset together.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>Peking Kebabs is a great example of 1980s modern Chinese cinema. It has mainstream appeal, strengthened by its dubbed English dialogue with thick American accents. The story, which follows a group of young and ambitious locals, would have struck a chord with the country&#8217;s youth population. The use of contemporary Peking as the backdrop to the story further conveys the film&#8217;s desire to situate itself within the modern world.<br />\n(4 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 11, 2012)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Beijing kebabs = Hei ko men erh!</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Changchun Film Studio and Wang Fengkui</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1987</p>", "description": "<p>In bustling Peking, Haizi is berated by his parents for his failure to pass his university entrance exam three consecutive times.

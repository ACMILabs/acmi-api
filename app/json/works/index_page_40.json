We see the family drive across the bridge to Phillip Island and enjoy swimming and canoeing at the beach there. The reel also includes scenes of caravan camping, koalas and a trip to the war memorial at Mount Macedon. The family enjoy games of tennis, ball games and swings and roundabouts at a playground. The film includes good examples of fashion, Austin cars and recreational activities of the time.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List (time codes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:01:37:00 children with their dad in the water at the beach (good example of bathing fashion)<br />\n00:02:58:00 tennis match between mum and dad<br />\n00:04:29:00 car with caravan and family in bush camp setting<br />\n00:05:14:00 Austin car with family standing at the front talking and combing hair<br />\n00:05:58:00 children being pushed on swings in a park by their mother (good fashion and sunglasses references)<br />\n00:7:30:00 close-up of little girl&#8217;s face as she blows out her birthday candles and looks to camera<br />\n00:07:41:00 family in front of war memorial at Mount Macedon<br />\n00:08:36:00 steam train travelling on a country rail line<br />\n00:08:46:00 family looking out from a ferry window<br />\n00:08:52:00 kids on a roundabout at a playground<br />\n00:09:00:00 grandmother, mother and children sitting on a playground wall – the grandmother is shooting a water pistol.<br />\n00:09:08:00 children on playground roundabout and dad jumps on to join them<br />\n00:09:32:00 a koala sitting in a tree climbs to the top and looks down<br />\n00:09:45:00 family and friends stand in front of a picket fence (good example of family groups and fashion from the time)<br />\n00:10:01:00 wide shot as cars travel across the bridge to Phillip Island</p>\n<p>00:10:14:00 POV from inside car as it drives over the Phillip Island bridge</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:17:19:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Koala", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mount Macedon (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Phillip Island (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Description and travel", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroad trains", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Fashion - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fashion", "Places&nbsp;→ Mount Macedon (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Phillip Island (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1850341, "name": "Charles Hayes", "creator_id": 84293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 2931, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/UmXTnuFmWlA"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "9.5mm film;

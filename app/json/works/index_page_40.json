In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>The collection is filmed on 16mm and 9.5mm film and the films can sometimes be a bit damaged and shaky.</p>\n<p>This 9.5mm example is from excerpts of Reels 4 and 5, showing scenes of Jack’s family and friends enjoying their scrambler motor bikes in muddy conditions at Korweinguboora, near Ballarat, Victoria. A group of friends are then shown travelling around the Victorian countryside on motorcycles (motorbikes). Motorcycles have been filmed from a vehicle travelling alongside. The bike riders gather for the camera at the &#8216;Atlantic Garage&#8217; possibly in Ballarat and then head off for a ride down a dusty country road.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:01:54:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motor vehicles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motorcycles", "Excerpt", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Leisure - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Motorcycle racing", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387493, "name": "Jesse Taylorsmith", "creator_id": 82090, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144108", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2387492, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

We see some examples of vintage cars as they were at the time. One of the residents is a young Ron Barassi of Australian Rules Football fame, and Victorian of the Year in 2009, who lived in Heathmont from 1957 to the late 1970s when he moved to St Kilda in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Indoor scenes of the family home show family members with some of their many pets a highlight of which is a game of table tennis with their pet cockatoo and cat.</p>\n<p>The film includes a trip to the beach with some some great examples of vintage bathing suits.</p>\n<p>Also seen in the film are the Gas and Fuel Corporation buildings on Flinders St which were built in 1967 and demolished in 1997 to make way for the current Federation Square in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Another glimpse of Melbourne&#8217;s history flashes across the family television screen - the logo for ‘Channel O’ which was the precursor to the current Channel 10 television station.</p>\n<p>There is also a segment showing a small or home based packaging business for what appears to be health food products.

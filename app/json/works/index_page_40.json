The gallery was run by John Reed, and was a precursor to the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Bulleen. The series of paintings had been commissioned by USP Benson to decorate the company’s new headquarters in South Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Later that year, Eidlitz received a Winston Churchill Fellowship and travelled to the United States, with the intention of studying with influential Hungarian-American artist Gyorgy Kepes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge. Eidlitz spent 1966 living between MIT and New York.</p>\n<p>This collection of films was made during Eidlitz&#8217;s time in the US and contains his experiments with light, movement and technology. Informed by his interests in kinetic and optical art, these early film experiments mark a shift in Eidlitz’s work, incorporating science and technology into his perceptual abstractions.</p>\n<p>The film reels in this collection contain offcuts and experiments, as well as completed projects including &#8216;Raga Doll&#8217; and &#8216;Calder&#8217;, both of which were screened in Melbourne and Sydney upon Eidlitz’s return to Australia in 1967. Inspired by his introduction to new technology and experimental uses of photography and film in the US, as well as the teachings of Kepes, Eidlitz was one of the first artists to use computer graphics as a medium in Australia during the 1970s. Following his fellowship in the US, Eidlitz held exhibitions throughout Australia, in Europe and in New York.</p>\n<p>The Frank Eidlitz Collection was generously donated to ACMI by the Eidlitz family.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Lighting", "Crafts &

When his French wife divorces him he is left without money or possessions, except for a suitcase full of diplomas, a comb and a paper. A compatriot smuggles him home and his luck improves. Things have changed in the new democratic Poland. Janos becomes a successful businessman but must still resolve his relationship with his wife. Stars Zbigniew Zamachowski and Julie Delpy.

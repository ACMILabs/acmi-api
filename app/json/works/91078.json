It is 1645, and England is in the grip of civil war. As law and order collapses, and unrest plagues the populace, cries of witchcraft begin to echo across the land. Soldier Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) finally gains permission from John Lowes, the priest of Branderston, to marry his niece, Sara (Hilary Dwyer), as long as he promises to take her away to another village. As Richard returns to his regiment, Matthew Hopkins (Vincent Price) and his sadistic assistant, John Stearne, ride into town, seeking a priest who allegedly worships Satan.

In exchange for her uncle&#8217;s life, Sara agrees, and all is well until one night Stearne follows Hopkins to her home and learns why the priest has received a reprieve. While Hopkins is away on business in the neighbouring town, Stearne corners Sara and rapes her. One of the men who accused John Lowes of idolatry misinterprets the nature of this attack and tells Hopkins, who, in a fit of jealousy, orders the torture and death of her uncle.

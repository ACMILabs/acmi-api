The Zulu chief is played by the real-life Chief Buthelezzi.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>One of the most popular British films of the 1960&#8217;s, &#8220;Zulu&#8221; is based on the true story of the defence of Rorke&#8217;s Drift in 1879. In this battle, 1200 men of the South Wales Borderers confronted four thousand attacking Zulu warriors. A stunning, historically accurate, battle picture starring the great British actors Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins and Michael Caine in his first screen role. A movie of &#8220;epic&#8221; proportions, the long and bloody battle is depicted in meticulous detail. The Zulus, who had never seen a motion picture, were shown an old Roy Rogers western to assist their performance. The Zulu chief is played by the real-life Chief Buthelezzi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Colonies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Foreign relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Africa - History", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Colonies", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - 19th century"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/zulu-1964", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2291885, "name": "Cy Endfield", "creator_id": 77700, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q673315", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2291881, "name": "Cy Endfield", "creator_id": 77700, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q673315", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2291880, "name": "Sir Stanley Baker", "creator_id": 77699, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1306352", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2291879, "name": "Diamond Films", "creator_id": 77698, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271256", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2291877, "name": "Joseph E.

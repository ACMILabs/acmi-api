Her classmate Yao Xiaohe, who comes from a provincial background, is described as more like the leaping carp of Chinese folk-tale, who epitomises the ambitious and persevering attitude of those who give everything they’ve got to achieve their dreams. At the same time, Yao Xiaohe is overwhelmed by the dog-eat-dog nature of society. While at a boxing match, she attempts to reconcile the lofty teachings and ideals of her education with the rough nature of competition.<br />\nMeanwhile, the break-up of Mimi’s parents leaves her disillusioned by the practical strains on commitments and love within a society.

While Kitano&#8217;s deadpan comic character with a tendency to extreme and sudden violence is familiar from his earlier work, &#8216;Kikujiro&#8217; marks a departure from the milieu of the criminal underworld to focus on the unlikely bond that gradually develops between the man and boy. The film evokes Chaplin&#8217;s &#8216;The Kid&#8217;, both in Kitano&#8217;s trademark use of visual gags and in its sentimental bittersweet tone. In Japanese with English subtitles. Cast includes Takeshi Kitano, Yusuke Sekiguchi and Kayoko Kishimoto.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children of divorced parents", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959512, "name": "Office Kitano", "creator_id": 30312, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959513, "name": "Bandai Visual Company", "creator_id": 30358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959514, "name": "Nippon Herald Films", "creator_id": 32482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959515, "name": "Masayuki Mori", "creator_id": 78820, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q302456", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959516, "name": "Takio Yoshida", "creator_id": 78822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959517, "name": "Takeshi Kitano", "creator_id": 7712, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q26372", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48055", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [30269], "external_references": [{"id": 552, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1091097"}]}, {"id": 90802, "acmi_id": "313828", "title": "Kiko the kangaroo: red hot rhythm", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kiko-the-kangaroo-red-hot-rhythm", "creator_credit": "Paul Terry and Castle Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1936", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Animated film presenting Kiko the kangaroo.

L.I.E., which stands for Long Island Expressway, is a symbolic reminder to 15 year-old Howie (Paul Franklin Dano) who has recently lost his mother through a car accident on the L.I.E. and is struggling to cope emotionally with her loss. His father Marty (Bruce Altman) who finds solace in a shallow based-on-sex relationship with his new girlfriend is also on the run from the law through his corrupt business practices and barely has time for his lonely grieving son. Disillusioned and confused, Howie forms a bond with three rather rebellious and streetwise dysfunctionals who spend more time out of school than in, robbing local houses to finance their habits. The relationship between Howie, and Gary (Billy Kay), who unbeknownst to Howie sometimes works as a male prostitute, evolves into something beyond friendship, causing Howie to reflect on his sexuality and his feelings towards Gary. But the issue of Howie&#8217;s sexuality soon takes another path when through one of his robbery escapades with Gary, he meets middle-aged ex-marine &#8220;Big John&#8221; Harrigan (Brian Cox) - a regular customer of Gary&#8217;s who has a penchant for boys in their early teens. When Gary runs off to California, and his father is arrested by the FBI, Howie finds an unexpected degree of emotional support in his relationship with the rather curious and compassionate paedophile who seemingly understands Howie&#8217;s tenuous and helpless situation.

The charm of the narrative is that it presents from a child&#8217;s perspective with uncomplicated views on life, unsullied by conjecture and misguided beliefs. The African village where this whimsical tale is set is abundant with colour, humour, culture and magic, with animation inspired by the earth colours and myths of Africa and imbued with a rich palette reminiscent of 19th century French painter Henri Rousseau. Music scored by Senegalese musician Youssou N&#8217;dour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Africa, West", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - Africa", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - France", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Africa", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Myth", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fables", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Literature&nbsp;→ Myth", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa", "Places&nbsp;→ Africa, West"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/kirikou-and-the-sorceress", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999649, "name": "Michel Ocelot", "creator_id": 62138, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999648, "name": "Jacques Vercruyssen", "creator_id": 80910, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999647, "name": "Paul Thiltges", "creator_id": 80909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999646, "name": "Didier Brunner", "creator_id": 80908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999645, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999644, "name": "Monipoly Productions", "creator_id": 36673, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999643, "name": "Odec Kid Cartoons", "creator_id": 36672, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999642, "name": "Les Armateurs", "creator_id": 36671, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52614", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [34115], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94596, "acmi_id": "318522", "title": "Intimacy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "intimacy-dvd-e", "creator_credit": "Patrice Chereau, Patrick Cassavetti, Jacques Hinstin, Canal+, Azor Films and Arte France", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The opening moments of &#8220;Intimacy&#8221; set the scene perfectly for this erotic drama, that is also an examination of an quite ordinary marriage: two people, in a grotty, shambolic London house, engage in urgent and silent sex, communicating nothing other than their instinct for lust and pleasure.

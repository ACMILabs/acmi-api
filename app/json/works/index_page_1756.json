In Danish with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Adapted from a long-forgotten play by Hjalmar Soderberg written during the early years of the 20th century, Dreyer&#8217;s controversial last film centres on a proud, stubborn woman who demands total commitment in love and forsakes both her husband and a former lover for a young musician who is relatively indifferent to her. The film moves at a slow, theatrical pace with long takes recorded mainly in direct sound (though shot principally in a studio), and deserves to be ranked along with &#8216;The Magnificent Ambersons, &#8216;Lola Montes&#8217;, and &#8216;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#8217; as one of the great haunted-memory films. Its meaning hinges partially on the refusal or inability to compromise and what this implies over the range of an entire life (in this case Dreyer&#8217;s as well as his heroine&#8217;s). The heroine may be regarded as a monster, a sublime and saintly martyr, or most likely an impossible fusion of the two. Dreyer&#8217;s film has a similarly dialectical and contradictory effect&#8212;at once narrative and (in the figure of Gertrud herself) nonnarrative, static and flowing, a tribute to free will and a positing of the unconscious as tragic destiny.

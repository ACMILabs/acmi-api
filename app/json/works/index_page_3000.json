As well as attempting to delve into the psyches of Cobain and Love (aka Frances Farmer), Broomfield looks at the various theories surrounding Cobain&#8217;s death, which was shrouded in mystery and which instantly became part of the long list of conspiracy theories which our society finds so compelling. Broomfield&#8217;s documentary is in no way objective, but it is fascinating to watch, as the director pointedly incorporates his own battle to get his film made with Courtney Love vehemently attempting to stop the film. With home footage of Cobain and interviews with people who knew Cobain and Love, this is a must see for Nirvana fans (although due to legal constraints Broomfield could not use any music by Nirvana in the film).

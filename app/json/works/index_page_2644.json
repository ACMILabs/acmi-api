The grainy black-and-white images and intertitles refer to early silent movies. Of its filmic qualities, curator Michael Connor wrote of the work, &#8220;the work adapts cinematic montage to the web &#8230; separate frames are joined together by HTML code and the browser itself and experienced in both space and in time, employing what Lev Manovich has characterized as spatial and temporal montage.&#8221; - Wikipedia</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 21}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": null, "source_identifier": null, "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [721]}, {"id": 70715, "acmi_id": "007404", "title": "My big chance", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "my-big-chance", "creator_credit": "Swinburne Institute of Technology.

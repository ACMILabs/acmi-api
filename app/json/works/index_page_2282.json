Lukas, Mikes best friend and Kaja, another young addict, encourage Lukas to continue using. The three of them are unable to forge an existence beyond the realms of petty crime, perpetual scoring and getting high. Filmed on digital, &#8220;Angel exit&#8221; utilises the style of cinema verite, and has a pallid colour scheme that reflects the futility of its angry and abusive protagonists. &#8220;Sekala has to die&#8221; is a World War II period drama, set in a rural Czech village where two interlopers - Sekala and Zaprdek, threaten the local community. Sekala is the half brother of Oberva, a highly regarded member of the town, who is respected by their father. When Sekala&#8217;s demands press the tolerance of the locals a young blacksmith is chosen to execute Sekala and rid them of his menace. Beautifully photographed, &#8220;Sekala has to die&#8221; is a moral tale, seeped in the typical golden tones of European art house cinema.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Czech", "English", "Polish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Czech Republic", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Czech Republic", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Europe", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Czech Republic", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs - Psychological aspects", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Czech literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Czech Republic"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2400473, "name": "Vladimir Michalek", "creator_id": 33425, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2400472, "name": "Jaroslav Boucek", "creator_id": 33424, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2400471, "name": "BUC Film", "creator_id": 33423, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49675", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 49, "name": "Czech Republic", "slug": "czech-republic"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998-2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998-2000"}], "labels": [31736]}, {"id": 96286, "acmi_id": "503504", "title": "And they named it Holland", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "and-they-named-it-holland", "creator_credit": "Gerard J.

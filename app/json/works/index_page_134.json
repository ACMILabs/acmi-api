Cast includes: Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess and Thomas Mitchell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Air pilots", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/only-angels-have-wings", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956392, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956393, "name": "Howard Hawks", "creator_id": 57225, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956391, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44149", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1939", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1939"}], "labels": [27147], "external_references": [{"id": 674, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1501765"}, {"id": 5063, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "43832"}]}, {"id": 89135, "acmi_id": "311787", "title": "Onegin [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "onegin-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Baby Productions, Onegin Productions, Ileen Maisel, Simon Bosanquet and Martha Fiennes", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1998", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Jaded aristocrat, Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes), gladly abandons the decadent opulence of St. Petersburg&#8217;s high society after unexpectedly inheriting his uncle&#8217;s country estate.

The aesthetic of the film overflows with lurid colour, in particular the elaborate setting of Floop&#8217;s castle with his peculiar army of plasticine-like figures and thumb-men. The film marks a shift in genre for director Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Desperado, From dusk till dawn) whose previous efforts have been films of a more violent and bloody nature. Also starring Terri Hatcher, Robert Patrick and Tony Shaloub.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:07:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962798, "name": "Dimension Films", "creator_id": 71422, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962799, "name": "Troublemaker Studios", "creator_id": 71421, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962800, "name": "Elizabeth Avellan", "creator_id": 71424, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962801, "name": "Robert Rodriguez", "creator_id": 71423, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962797, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51274", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33149]}, {"id": 95468, "acmi_id": "319619", "title": "Spy hard", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "spy-hard", "creator_credit": "Hollywood Pictures, Rick Friedberg, Doug Draizin and Jeffrey Konvitz", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1996", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) aka Agent WD-40, is brought out of retirement to save the world from destruction and annihilation by the hands of the notorious General Rancor (Andy Griffith) who has a hidden missile at a secret base.

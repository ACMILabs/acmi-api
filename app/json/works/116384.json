The cinema remains the favorite distraction of a population looking mostly for entertainment and escapism. The first films to start production in Paris were not the work of French companies, but of a new German organisation, Continental-Films. The Vichy Government created a new ruling body (COIC), which introduced a sounder financial framework, box-office control, a boost to short film production and a new film school (IDHEC). With the absence of the great names of the pre-war period who are either in exile or in hiding, many young actors and film-makers are given their first chance.

The situation was very different for a Guy de Carmoy, an active supporter of the Resistance, than for a Marcel Carne, who at much less risk gave jobs to old friends in defiance of the ban on Jewish filmmakers.

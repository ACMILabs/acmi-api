knitting mills of the district.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Dorothy Briggs and Irene Malone.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[PEOPLE SHOUTING] DOROTHY BRIGGS:    That must&#8217;ve been the team, because they were all there and had their photo taken. We all worked here at the Holmes&#8217; Mill. We were weavers and all those sorts of thing.</p>\n<p>We got together and we&#8212; we did a bit of training. And they went up to the park and trained, just like the footballers do, and then played this team from over the big mill. My gosh, there were some big girls amongst them, of course.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The first team that played Daylesford, nobody wanted to walk out first. And I had number 9, so they turned around and said I had to go first. So they gave me number 1 and pushed me at the door to go through, yeah. Because once one went out, then the rest followed, of course.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>I was brought up with five brothers, so you learned to kick the football. It was a lot of fun. Put it that way. A lot of fun. It was&#8212; some of the girls had never been in a pair of shorts, and &#8230; As you can imagine what it was like when they got out on the&#8212; and some of them had never kicked a football, so you could imagine what that was like..</p>\n<p>[PEOPLE SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The first time we played, there must&#8217;ve been some footballers up in Daylesford at the time. And I remember them taking up a collection. And I got half the money and June Jeffries&#8212; I think it was June Jeffries&#8212; got the other half, because they reckoned we were the best on the ground.</p>\n<p>And it was surprising was in the people would go to see&#8212; well, I think most of the men just went to see the girls in their shorts, I think, and see how they&#8217;d kick a football.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[PEOPLE SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>They were all good friends. Oh, a jovial lot. When you look at that now, I can count up the ones that&#8217;s not there, that&#8217;s not with us anymore. It&#8217;s sad, really, that there&#8217;s so many of &#8216;ems gone. But then when you look at it now and see the girls that&#8217;s out kicking football on the ground, there&#8217;s just as many as there is boys.</p>\n<p>And some of the girls can kick. Over at Newland last week, there was a little tot, and she was left-footed. And she could kick that ball. Oh, I watched her and watched her.

We used to get dressed in the Spargo hotel. Had to wade across through the creek, which you can see down the bottom there, get our feet nice and wet. If you were up there playing fullback or full-forward, and the ball was down this end, you could not see which side had the ball.</p>\n<p>There was a big hump in the middle of the ground, and the only way you could fathom it out was which direction the ball was travelling. And on one wing, we used to have to wade through ferns to get the ball.</p>\n<p>There was rabbits all around the area at those times, and it was often when we were crossing the creek, there&#8217;d be rabbits running around everywhere. [LAUGHS] And well, as you can see, the ground has not changed.</p>\n<p>[SHEEP BLEATING]</p>\n<p>There were a lot of grounds that were in pretty ordinary condition in those days.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I remember on the Chewton football ground in the Castlemaine league, that electric light was running through the ground about the center half forward position. And often the ball would hit that, and if you were standing on the wire, you were surprised when you found yourself you had the ball.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>DON DUUS: I don&#8217;t know whether the Chewton fullback knew he could hit the lines, but he hit them very, very regular. And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on. And of course, if the umpire told us that we could play on if the power lines were hit, we used to play on and kick goals, much to the annoyance of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The Harcourt was pretty bad. It had a big creek running down one side of it. And many a player&#8217;s disappeared down the creek. Kyneton was a little bit difficult. You would always walk off the Kyneton ground four to six inches taller, because the black turfy ground from here used to build up on your boots.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Trenton and Woodend weren&#8217;t too bad when we played out with them. But the biggest trouble there was the snow. We played on Woodend, I think it was, at one stage on about 6 inches of snow.</p>\n<p>And I remember one of the players, real tough, hard player, come out.

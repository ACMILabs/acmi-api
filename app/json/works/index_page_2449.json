She has a sick little girl who wants &#8220;an orange&#8221; more than anything- how times have changed. The dog goes through Hell to get the orange, fighting all sorts of weird demons, other puppets, and Satan himself! Finally winning in the end this small dose of vitamin C is all that is required to prevent a life dominated by an unrelenting bleak and threatening environment. &#8216;Love in Black and White&#8217; (1923-7, 22 mins): A curious racial rivalry between cupids and an exploration of promiscuity amongst vaudellians. Puppets are modelled on Charlie Chaplin, Tom Mix and Mary Pickford. &#8216;The Tale of the Fox&#8217; (1931, 65 mins): Starewicz&#8217; epic took over 10 years to finish. It is based on Goethe&#8217;s Reineke Fuchs, and film reviewers of the time said it was beyond any animated film ever attempted, in fact, it approached poetry.

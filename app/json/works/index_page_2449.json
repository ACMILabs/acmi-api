The notion of preconceived ideas of Aboriginal art is discussed as well as the non-stereotypical aboriginality represented in the urban artist&#8217;s work where mythical, cultural and environmental heritage is referred to, but situated politically as a confrontation of past and present issues effecting indigenous Australians.

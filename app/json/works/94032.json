Bali is renowned for having some of the best waves in the world and through a program of surfing contests (attracting the international media), surfing magazines and an organization called Wave of Change, the focus is now on the next generation, who also surf, to be environmental ambassadors and promote the message for preservation of the marine environment and a policy of sustainable development in Bali and throughout the Indonesian islands.

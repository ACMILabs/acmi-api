The placement proves a success, although it eventually leads to a crisis. After a decade in televison, Pialat made his directorial debut with a New Wave style drama of adolescence featuring a cast of non-professional players. Such films, ten years after the arrival of the &#8216;nouvelle vague&#8217;, had become a kind of recognized genre unto themselves rather than a striking gesture of independence from established norms, and it is not surprising that Pialat&#8217;s work often led him in other directions.

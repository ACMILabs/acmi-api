Vaslav Nijinski was a dynamic force in ballet, wanting to broaden the possibilities of dance - perhaps ahead of his time. Imagery from the natural world mixed with interpretations of ballets, historical documents and re-creations of the people and times of his life, are all lead by rich voice of Derek Jacobi, who narrates as Nijinsky reading directly from the dancer&#8217;s diaries. Thoughts on his career, his sexuality, his mental health and general place in the world reveal some of the inner turmoil of the man and his artistic temperament. His career was short lived as Nijinsky became mentally ill, remaining in an institution until his death in 1950. Directed and edited by Paul Cox &#8220;The Diaries&#8221; is a work that demonstrates the filmmaker&#8217;s passion for the dancer and writer that was Nijinsky.

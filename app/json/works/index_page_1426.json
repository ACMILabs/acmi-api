The Bunyip Newsletter is hand-delivered across the wider Greta area by six committed volunteers. We meet Noeleen Lloyd and Allan Porker as well as local historian Joan Ellis and hear about the importance of having a local newsletter. &#8216;The Bunyip&#8217; was born out of a demand from the locals to be better informed and more connected to their community and surrounds. Over 300 newsletters are distributed every two months containing articles of historical, sporting and community importance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:09:29:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Community newspapers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Newspaper publishing - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Written communication", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Digital Storytelling", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communication - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community education", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community organization", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Country life - Psychological aspects", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia", "Travelogue"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2659650, "name": "Csilla Csongvay", "creator_id": 81964, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357843", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659654, "name": "David Withers", "creator_id": 83567, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659647, "name": "ACMI Content Development", "creator_id": 10904, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357855", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659649, "name": "Shelley Matulick", "creator_id": 83993, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337423", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2659643, "name": "ACMI", "creator_id": 6272, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2659651, "name": "Evan Munro-Smith", "creator_id": 83734, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361080", "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659652, "name": "Jim Arneman", "creator_id": 81966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659648, "name": "Kim Montgomery", "creator_id": 8660, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659644, "name": "Arts Victoria", "creator_id": 11250, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "partner", "role_id": 575, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659645, "name": "Rural City of Wangaratta", "creator_id": 83992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "partner", "role_id": 575, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659646, "name": "ACMI Media Studio", "creator_id": 9250, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035971", "role": "production facilities", "role_id": 442, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2659653, "name": "Matt Blackwood", "creator_id": 83599, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271459", "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file H264;

Contains footage of the infamous World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil and examines the after effects on the black players - who were blamed squarely for the loss. The arrival of Pele (aged 17) brought black pride back to many Brazilians and saw the rise of one of the world&#8217;s greatest, and most beloved, players. Another great player, Garincha (a contemporary of Pele&#8217;s) also became a figure of Brazilian pride. Current problems for football in Brazil are addressed here - poverty, elitism, corruption and the exiting of players to Europe.

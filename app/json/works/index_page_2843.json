The year is 2026 and the inhabitants of the world are divided into two classes: an elite &#8216;ruling&#8217; class who spend their time in futile pursuits, living in luxury on the planet&#8217;s surface, and the working class, who toil below ground, doomed to serve from birth to death as slaves to the monstrous machines they tend. When the son of the ruler of the great city of &#8220;Metropolis&#8221; falls in love with a woman of the lower class, the stage is set for an earth shaking confrontation.

More than a teenage flick, director Alexander Payne has satirized the popular genre to investigate notions of political and moral corruption. In a clever piece of casting, Matthew Broderick exchanges his Ferris Bueller persona for the devoted and concerned teacher who is slightly burned out from years of teaching. Add to this the disillusionment of a dull marriage and the shameful dismissal of McAllister&#8217;s best friend and colleague, and the esteemed civic teacher&#8217;s sense of democracy is put to the test. Brilliant performances, subtle humour and an excellent screenplay (an Oscar nomination for Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor). Surprisingly, this film was a box office sleeper. Based on the novel by Tom Perrotta.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Students - Political activity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women in politics", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/election-1999", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960684, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960685, "name": "MTV Films", "creator_id": 60813, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960686, "name": "Bona Fide Productions", "creator_id": 79846, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960687, "name": "Albert Berger", "creator_id": 77653, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960688, "name": "Ron Yerxa", "creator_id": 77655, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960689, "name": "David Gale", "creator_id": 79847, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960690, "name": "Keith Samples", "creator_id": 79848, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6384982", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960691, "name": "Alexander Payne", "creator_id": 79849, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q313566", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960683, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49957", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [31973], "external_references": [{"id": 2912, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1206261"}, {"id": 4061, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "9451"}]}, {"id": 67062, "acmi_id": "320607", "title": "Elder citizen", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "elder-citizen", "creator_credit": "Grant McLean, ONF | NFB and Don Haldane", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1956", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1956-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Cut off from the life in which they once took an active part, many of Canada&#8217;s senior citizens find themselves without companionship or security in their declining years.

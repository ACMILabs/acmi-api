Accidentally separated from his family, Remy coincidentally arrives at the former restaurant of his chef hero, Gusteau, and seizes an opportunity to secretly create a soup that is a menu hit. Discovered and threatened with destruction, Remy teams up with the hapless garbage-boy, Linguini, to create the best food in Paris (and therefore, of course, the best food in the world!). While Linguini takes credit for the culinary art they produce, it is actually Remy exercising creative control (sitting under Linguini&#8217;s chef&#8217;s hat and steering his actions by pulling on his hair).

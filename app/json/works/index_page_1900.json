Here he meets &#8216;Juicy Judy&#8217; (Judy Marte) and he decides to pursue her. Living in a small apartment with his strict Grandmother, sister and piano-playing younger brother Nino (Rasuk&#8217;s real-life brother Silvestre), Victor finds life as a teenager challenging when he gets the blame for having a bad influence on his siblings. Coming-of-age is tough (and sometimes comical) for Victor as he finds real love, gets a glimpse of what manhood is about and asserts his place within the family. Based on the short film &#8220;Five Feet High and Rising&#8221; by its writer/director Peter Sollett. Cast also includes Kevin Rivera, Altagracia Guzman, Melonie Diaz.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.) - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social workers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Urban poor - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Dating (Social customs)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal relations in adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Peer pressure", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Conduct of life", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming pools", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Piano"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964759, "name": "Studio Canal", "creator_id": 31030, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964760, "name": "Alain de la Mata", "creator_id": 81042, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964761, "name": "Peter Sollett", "creator_id": 36984, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964762, "name": "Robin O'hara", "creator_id": 79659, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964763, "name": "Scott Macaulay", "creator_id": 6916, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964764, "name": "Peter Sollett", "creator_id": 36984, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964758, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52951", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34406]}, {"id": 72049, "acmi_id": "008942", "title": "Raising the standard", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "raising-the-standard", "creator_credit": "World Wide, British Productivity Council, James Carr and John Spencer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1954", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1954-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Discusses the British standard of living and relates it to productivity and ways in which both may be improved.

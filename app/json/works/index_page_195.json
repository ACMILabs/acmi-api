This classic opera set in 1904 on the outskirts of Nagasaki, tells the tragic story of Cio-Cio-San (Ying Huang), a 15 year-old Japanese girl who falls in love with an American sailor named Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton (Richard Troxell). Butterfly (Pinkerton&#8217;s name for Cio-Cio-San), blinded by passion marries Pinkerton, against her family&#8217;s wishes. However, Pinkerton&#8217;s intentions turn out to be not so honourable, returning to America without Butterfly, but promising he will be back soon. Butterfly is left heart-broken but always hopeful of his return. Three long years pass by before Pinkerton, after learning that Butterfly had given birth to a son fathered by him just before his return to America, decides to make the trip back to Japan. Only this time he has a wife in tow and the sole intention of taking his child back to America leaving Butterfly entirely alone. What follows is a most tragic and heart-breaking climax. Seeing opera presented in film as opposed to on stage has quite a powerful effect. Film through its cinematography (Phillipe Welt) opens up the boundaries of scope of outside landscapes and lush settings enhancing the period of costume, culture, mood and the beautiful music of Puccini and allowing a natural flow to the story. Superb performances by the leading singers with a great support performance by Ning Liang (Suzuki), Richard Cowen (Sharpless), Jing Ma Fan, Christopheren Nomura, Constance Hauman, Yo Kusakabe, Kamel Touati, Miki-Lou Pinard.

Julia sets out determinedly to find Carmelo, following a trail of clues to Vera Cruz where she encounters an eclectic mix of new friends including a motherly hotel manager with an acerbic tongue, a prostitute with a young baby, and a transvestite named Susy (Tito Vasconcelos). This journey of self-discovery, of old loves and new loves, twists and turns gently to the tune of the rhythmic Mexican music and the sensually tantalising dancing of the danzon. Maria Novaro (Lola, 1989) is one of Mexico&#8217;s most successful women film directors and is not only renowned for her feminist approach but is also considered an &#8220;expressionist&#8221; director for the use of colors as an important feature in her filmmaking. &#8220;Danzon&#8221; appeared in the Cannes Film Festival Official Selection for 1991.

Mexico in fact celebrated the 100th anniversary of the danzon in the 1990s. Sensual and seductive, danzon expresses the unspoken relationship which exists between the dancing partners, where &#8220;the man commands and the woman obeys; the man seduces and the woman shines&#8221; and for Julia, when Carmelo (Daniel Rergis), her suave and elegant dancing partner of ten years, mysteriously disappears one night, life suddenly becomes meaningless. Julia sets out determinedly to find Carmelo, following a trail of clues to Vera Cruz where she encounters an eclectic mix of new friends including a motherly hotel manager with an acerbic tongue, a prostitute with a young baby, and a transvestite named Susy (Tito Vasconcelos). This journey of self-discovery, of old loves and new loves, twists and turns gently to the tune of the rhythmic Mexican music and the sensually tantalising dancing of the danzon. Maria Novaro (Lola, 1989) is one of Mexico&#8217;s most successful women film directors and is not only renowned for her feminist approach but is also considered an &#8220;expressionist&#8221; director for the use of colors as an important feature in her filmmaking. &#8220;Danzon&#8221; appeared in the Cannes Film Festival Official Selection for 1991. Cast also includes Carmen Salinas, Margarita Isabel, Victor Carpinteiro, Cheli Godinez. Original music by Agustin Lara, Pepe Luis, Felipe Perez, Consuelo Velazquez.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A light-hearted romantic tale about thirty-something Julia (Maria Rojo), a telephone operator and single mother of a 15-year-old daughter living in Mexico City whose passion is dancing the &#8220;danzon&#8221;, a ballroom dance with its origins in Haiti and which spread across to Cuba during the mid-1800s, finally finding its way to Mexico several years later.

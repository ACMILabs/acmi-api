Hong Kong was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking. This was followed by numerous costly rebellions (in terms of human lives and economics), biggest being the Taiping Rebellion (1851–1864), Punti-Hakka Clan Wars, and the Boxer Rebellion.

The significance of the film lies in its commemoration of the forgotten heroes of China during the end of the Qing&#8217;s reign; it effectively illustrates the feeling of insignificance and powerlessness felt by the troops.

Based on the 1968 children&#8217;s story &#8220;Iron man&#8221; by British poet laureate Ted Hughes, the film&#8217;s archetypal story of fear and prejudice depicts the unusual friendship between a nine year old boy called Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) and a giant robot that mysteriously lands in small town Maine circa 1958. The town&#8217;s suspicious adults greet the enigmatic visitor with open hostility, pushing the young boy into a protective role with the misunderstood giant. When nosy government agents descend upon the town in search of the robot, Hogarth begins to find hiding the car-eating giant a challenging task. Brad Bird laces this wonderful children&#8217;s fantasy with a strong political parable about the cold war fear that permeated every aspect of American society and includes a hilarious cartoon version of the now infamous educational film &#8220;Duck and cover&#8221;. Cast includes: Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick JR, Vin Diesel, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, M. Emmet Walsh, Christopher McDonald.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A loving homage to fifties science fiction movies, Brad Bird&#8217;s animated &#8220;The Iron giant&#8221; has a strong sense of that era&#8217;s unerring innocence mixed with the looming paranoia of the unfamiliar &#8216;other&#8217;.

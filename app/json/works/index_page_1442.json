Voted second best film ever made by a &#8220;Sight and Sound&#8221; international poll in 1992.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>After the international success of &#8220;La Dolce Vita&#8221; Fellini found himself in the position of an &#8220;overnight sensation&#8221;, with critics, audiences and cinema producers expecting his next film to be even more of a success. His predicament caused him to experience a self-doubting of his intellect and creativity, a self-doubt that he managed to commit to screen in this wonderful film. For &#8220;8 1/2&#8221; is about the struggle to create cinema; about the financial, creative, physical and mental exertions needed to produce a film. Marcello Mastroianni plays a film director, Guido Anselmi, who is beset by adoring fans, angry mistresses, nervous financial backers and hostile critics while in the process of directing his current film. Mixing autobiography, fantastical dream sequences, imaginative sets and starkly photographed childhood memories, &#8220;8 1/2&#8221; is the most entertaining and stimulating film ever made about film-making. Cast includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee and Barbara Steele. Music score by Nino Rota. Voted second best film ever made by a &#8220;Sight and Sound&#8221; international poll in 1992.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Creative ability", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 21}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 67939, "name": "Angelo Rizzoli", "creator_id": 60744, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 67940, "name": "Federico Fellini", "creator_id": 60737, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 67937, "name": "Cineriz", "creator_id": 60689, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 67938, "name": "Francinex", "creator_id": 60690, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 6, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/8%C2%BD_1963.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 470, "height": 653, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38962", "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1962", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1962"}], "labels": [90]}, {"id": 88321, "acmi_id": "45245", "title": "The Truman show", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-truman-show", "creator_credit": "Peter Weir, Adam Schroeder, Edward S.

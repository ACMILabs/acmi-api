The sensuous, quasi-dominatrix, Cristal, is attracted to Nomi and impressed by her dancing skills. Eventually, Nomi is accepted into the exclusive dance show and is able to strut her stuff. We get to witness the level of bitchiness behind the stage in the dressing room where the fiercest is between Nomi and Cristal.

Written by one of Hollywood&#8217;s highest paid screenwriters and regular Verhoeven collaborator, Joe Eszterhas, &#8220;Showgirls&#8221; is filled with lowly, tawdry behaviour, cliches and plot points: bitchiness, infantile power games, old-fashioned representations of gender and sex, naked ambition, sexist machismo, and even an odd value system which sees Nomi making claims to artistry and objecting to charges of being a whore whilst at the same time climbing the ladder via sleeping with her boss and giving audiences all the body they can muster. But like all good B-grade, exploitation cinema, Verhoeven indulges in genre cinema and lowly attitudes of sex and gender in a highly energised, dazzling mode in order to give them a new spin.

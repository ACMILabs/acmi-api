Featuring over 6,000 competitors, this prestigious event is the second largest sporting event in number of athletes only to the Olympics. &#8216;Bronzed Aussie Gods&#8217; follows three groups of men and women in training as lifesavers, performing real life rescues, enjoying their work, and vying for title glory. Interspersed with their plight is a trip down memory lane courtesy of archival footage capturing the changing customs and costumes that celebrate Australia&#8217;s unique relationship with the beach. This results in a film which celebrates Australian beach culture and maps the evolution of a strong aspect of Australian identity.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Group identity", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Group identity", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Aquatic sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surf lifesaving - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Surfing", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2125656, "name": "Michael Murray", "creator_id": 78753, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091123", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2125649, "name": "Michael Murray", "creator_id": 78753, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091123", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2125652, "name": "Nick Bleszinski", "creator_id": 78754, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126622", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2125641, "name": "Light Source Films", "creator_id": 30098, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034471", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2125638, "name": "Wild Releasing", "creator_id": 28011, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270760", "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44798", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [27552]}, {"id": 87230, "acmi_id": "309155", "title": "Bronski Beat: the first chapter", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bronski-beat-the-first-chapter", "creator_credit": "PolyGram Records and PolyGram Video", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1985", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Openly gay, the Bronskis became cover darlings of the British music press in 1984 after the U.K. success of their first two singles, &#8220;Why&#8221; and &#8220;Smalltown Boy&#8221; (the latter producing one of the best music videos of all time).

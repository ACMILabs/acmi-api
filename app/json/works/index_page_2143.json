This film made by fifth form students of Bairnsdale Technical School, was an experiment to find the shortest film that could be made without crippling the educational worth of the project, which was completed in a month, with minimum expense. Eight periods of class time were spent out of doors in actual filming. For the other three weeks, students wrote the script and edited the film under normal classroom conditions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Student films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2464570, "name": "Kevin Murray", "creator_id": 75142, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360633", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2464569, "name": "Bairnsdale Technical School", "creator_id": 17026, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "26714", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [10534]}, {"id": 87715, "acmi_id": "309785", "title": "Oasis in space: what price progress?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "oasis-in-space-what-price-progress", "creator_credit": "Andrew W Sott, Philippe Cousteau, Andrew Solt Productions and Costeau Society Production", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1976", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Affects of pollution (asbestos) on drinking water in area of Silver bay in US.

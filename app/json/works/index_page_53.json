A young boy escorts the men around his home and the engineer becomes familiar with both the landscape and personages of this small rural community. Kiarostami&#8217;s films utilise realist conventions - non-actors, real sound and location - to create highly personal and philosophical works that examine the broad existential and theological questions of human life. Whereas the urban men at the beginning of the film are cynical and disparaging of the traditional lifestyle and values of the villagers, what the engineer discovers is that the timeless ethical codes of the village are well suited to dealing with the fundamental issues of life and death. He also discovers that beneath the veneer of stability and order in the village, chaos and change also have their place. Enriched by Mahaoud Kalar&#8217;s ravishing cinematography, &#8220;The Wind Will Carry Us&#8221; is an important addition to Kiarostami&#8217;s oeuvre as one of the foremost spiritual and philosophical of contemporary directors. In Farsi with English subtitles.

However, when she loses the money her mother has given her, young Razieh and her brother seek their fortunes in modern day Tehran. This visually ravishing contemporary retelling of &#8220;The Red Balloon&#8221;, reveals much about the culture of the Muslim world. By filming through a child&#8217;s eyes, director Jafar Panahi reveals a world of incidental cruelty, a world which often rushes by too fast to listen to the desires of children. There is a darkness in &#8220;The White Balloon&#8221;, not explicit, but a sadness about the opportunities adults lose in understanding the world of their child. As in all the best fairy-tales, this is a profoundly humane story. The screenplay is by acclaimed director Abbas Kiarostami. Winner of the Camera D&#8217;Or at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Arabic"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Iran", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-white-balloon", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954282, "name": "CMI", "creator_id": 27480, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954283, "name": "Dendy Films", "creator_id": 27284, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954284, "name": "Ferdos Films", "creator_id": 27481, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954285, "name": "Ferdos Films", "creator_id": 27481, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954286, "name": "Jafar Panahi", "creator_id": 64306, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954281, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 954287, "name": "Abbas Kiarostami", "creator_id": 71903, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "screenwriter", "role_id": 601, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41484", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 189, "name": "Iran, Islamic Republic of", "slug": "iran-islamic-republic-of"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [24975], "external_references": [{"id": 2464, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2355570"}, {"id": 6362, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "46785"}]}]}

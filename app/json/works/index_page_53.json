He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This film shows Dr Raymond Penington’s girls in the late 1930s and brief scenes of other members of the family.</p>\n<p>While the film is focused around his three daughters the main theme throughout is the youngest daughter, Jocelyn Penington.</p>\n<p>The film is located mainly in two places, the back yard at home and the beach, though there is a brief scene in the snow. It covers a short period as the girls grow up.</p>\n<p>While a very personal film, of interest for a general viewer includes fashion of the time which includes all generations.</p>\n<p>There is a scene which appears to be a birthday party where games of the time are being played such as statues.</p>\n<p>Also seen is an old tricycle and scooter.</p>\n<p>The film finishes as it started, with the family at the beach.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Edith Penington and daughter Jocelyn at the beach<br />\n00:01:21:00 Jocelyn Penington shuffling on her bottom in the yard at

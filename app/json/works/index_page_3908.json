Despite these and other difficulties, social groups thrived in the suburb, where people shared life, food, religion and a common experience. Local residents from the period, many recalling their childhood, discuss a marvellously rich and joyous, if impoverished, family life; others talk about the racism suffered at school and in the street; several recount the pain of being a Holocaust survivor and the trials of assimilation. Includes archival footage from the era interspersed with recreations and a slew of interviews that include: Pinchus Ringelblum, Hilary Rubinstein, Bernard Rechter, Solomon Pose, Victor Smorgon, Arnord Zable, Jean Holkner, June Factor, Freydi Mrocki, Sam Lipski, Amirah Inglis, Rachel Levita and Miriam Kuna. Features some marvellous Yiddish songs and several interviewees discuss their parents yearning to sustain the use of Yiddish language.

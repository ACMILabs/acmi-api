In many respects &#8216;Eyes wide shut&#8217; can be read as a road movie where instead of taking us through geographical space and time, Kubrick involves us in a journey across the human psyche and imagination. The film itself heavily divided audiences on its release. By attaching his cool distanced filmmaking techniques to a torrid psychoanalytic phantasm about marriage and sex, Kubrick has created something unique in cinema history: a melodrama which is in fact an anti-love story, a Sirkean study of love as re-imagined by Ingmar Bergman. Whatever one&#8217;s opinion about &#8216;Eyes wide shut&#8217;, what is undeniable is the supreme confidence of Kubrick&#8217;s filmmaking, both visually and in terms of the rich, mesmerising soundtrack. The film stars the then real-life married couple, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Literature&nbsp;→ Austrian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "People&nbsp;→ Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2224448, "name": "Stanley Kubrick", "creator_id": 66943, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2001", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2224440, "name": "Hobby Films", "creator_id": 66909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2224441, "name": "Pole Star", "creator_id": 66907, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2224442, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2224437, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50312", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32294]}, {"id": 92802, "acmi_id": "316132", "title": "Lolita [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "lolita-dvd", "creator_credit": "Stanley Kubrick, James B.

During a ball given by Charles, Lord Chateauneuf, a member of Louis XI&#8217;s party, tries to rape Jeanne. This causes a rupture between the King and the Duke and a war between France and Burgundy. Robert and Jeanne are separated. When Jeanne, carrying a secret letter from the King to Burgundy, is pursued by Chateauneuf, she benefits from the protection of a pack of wolves. This story was originally filmed by Raymond Bernard in 1924.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Paul Cadeac, Rene Bezard ; director, Andre Hunebelle ; writers, Jean Halain, Pierre Foucaud, Andre Hunebelle ; photography, Marcel Grignon ; music, Jean Marion.<br />\nCast: Jean Marais, Rossana Schiaffino, Roger Hanin, Jean-Louis Barrault, Louis Arbessier.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 891062, "name": "Paul Cadeac", "creator_id": 83001, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 891063, "name": "Andre Hunebelle", "creator_id": 83002, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146999", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [55761], "external_references": [{"id": 1589, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2558836"}]}, {"id": 116083, "acmi_id": "X000265", "title": "Le Million", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "le-million", "creator_credit": "Frank Clifford and Rene Clair", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1931", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1931-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>&#8220;The plot of &#8216;Le million&#8217; comes straight out of the great tradition of silent film comedy: a winning lottery ticket left in a tattered coat gives rise to a series of cinematic chases and comic misunderstandings.

Separating his story into twelve scenes which follow the classic structure of the nineteenth century novel (&#8220;Vivre Sa Vie&#8221; is a very loose adaptation of the Emile Zola classic &#8220;Nana&#8221;) Jean-Luc Godard constructs a film that is as much an essay on sexual exchange, and a study of Anna Karina&#8217;s beautiful face, as it is a straightforward narrative of a young woman destroyed by exploitative men. &#8220;Vivre Sa Vie&#8221; was a breakthrough film for Godard, one which saw him not only experimenting formally with manipulation of sound and image, but also beginning to fracture narrative and developing his unique approach to using the film medium for philosophical exploration. What startles now on revisiting the film is how neither his techniques nor his speculations have dated. If anything, the film&#8217;s contemplation and examination of prostitution, linking the exchange in bodies to both consumerism and to male oppression, can be seen as a precursor to the explorations and analyses of second-wave feminism. The film also explores how the very apparatus of cinema can be utilised to commodify and abstract the female into object. But in one emotionally stunning scene, where a dejected Nana, no money in her pocket, contemplates the suffering of Falconetti as Joan of Arc in Carl Dreyer&#8217;s classic silent film, &#8220;Vivre Sa Vie&#8221; asks us to consider the transcendent possibilities of art to transform culture and economies. The luminous black and white photography is by Raoul Coutard and the simple, elegant music by Michel Legrand.

So, amongst the cheap gun play and B-movie eroticism, there are quotes from Shakespeare and from Le Figaro&#8217;s analysis of the massacres in Rwanda; a character&#8217;s father is Arthur Rimbaud and Anna Karina&#8217;s face becomes the catalyst for some of cinema&#8217;s most romantic enthusings on beauty and on love. &#8220;Bande A Part&#8221; saw a young Godard begin to explore both the philosophical and plastic possibilities of cinema, and to begin his playful experimentation with sound and vision which was to make him the world&#8217;s most influential film director. His influence can still be seen in the recurrent use of moments and scenes from &#8220;Band A Part&#8221; in contemporary film-making: Hal Hartley punkishly re-invented the dance sequence from this movie in his &#8220;Simple Men&#8221;; Quentin Tarantino named his production company A Band Apart. The crisp black and white cinematography is by Raoul Coutard, the elegant music by Michel Legrand. Alongside Karina, the film stars Sami Frey and Claude Brasseur. Decades may have passed since it was first made, but seeing this movie still feels like drinking from the elixir of youth.

Dee Wallace plays Karen White, a feisty reporter on the trail of a serial killer (Robert Picardo). After a frightening confrontation with the killer which leaves him dead and her traumatized, Karen&#8217;s doctor (Patrick Macnee) recommends her to take some time off. Under his advice Karen heads off to the &#8216;The Colony&#8217;, a secluded hideaway full of very strange residents harboring a terrifying secret. Joe Dante peppers the film with plenty of horror film references (many of the characters are named after Werewolf movie directors) and includes a slew of sly cameos like John Sayles and B-movie mogul Roger Corman.

In a unique approach, the battle is presented from both sides, rejecting traditional notions of one-sided jingoistic storytelling, typical of many war films from the 50s and 60s. For the Japanese section directors Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku pay close attention to the military manoeuvring and blunders of the campaign as well as the infighting and personal clashes within the high command. For the American section, the army is depicted as unsuspecting of an attack of this scale, hampered by limited technology and a lack of foresight. Exciting battle sequences and detailed inner-sanctum decision making within both sides of the battle make &#8220;Tora! Tora! Tora!&#8221; an interesting war movie that is not simplistic in its politics and is effective in its recreation of a historically significant event. Cast includes Martin Balsam, So Yamamura, Joseph Cotton, Tatsuya Mihashi, E.G. Marshall, James Whitemore, Takahiro Tamura, Eijiro Tono, Jason Robards.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Air warfare", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Pearl Harbor (Hawaii), Attack on, 1941", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Atrocities - Drama", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Japan", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Historical films", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/tora-tora-tora", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2293132, "name": "Kinji Fukasaku", "creator_id": 34268, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q470779", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2293126, "name": "Richard Fleischer", "creator_id": 63814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262735", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2293127, "name": "Toshio Masuda", "creator_id": 79894, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3177199", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2293125, "name": "Elmo Williams", "creator_id": 34266, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q717147", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2293118, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2293113, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50103", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [32109]}, {"id": 92618, "acmi_id": "315921", "title": "The Poseidon adventure", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-poseidon-adventure-dvd", "creator_credit": "Ronald Neame, Irwin Allen and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1972", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44707, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q874496"}], "brief_description": "<p>One of the finest disaster/adventure movies of the 1970s, &#8220;The Poseidon adventure&#8221; is set on an ocean liner, capsized by a ninety-foot tidal wave one New Year&#8217;s Eve.

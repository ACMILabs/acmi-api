Forming the basis for Stephen Sondheim&#8217;s musical &#8216; A Little night music&#8217;, this is the story of a middle-aged lawyer, his inexperienced young wife and her step-so, who are all invited to spend the weekend at the country mansion of a beautiful actress, the lawyer&#8217;s ex-mistress. During the course of the weekend three couples meet, exchange partners and provide some lively comedic action, illustrating Bergman&#8217;s sardonic attitude towards the vagaries of love. Behind the scintillating and witty approach to this charming period comedy of manners lie the illusions and pretensions of the haute bourgeois which Bergman cleverly illistrates with his collection of fickle husbands and scheming women.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Sweden"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954889, "name": "Ingmar Bergman", "creator_id": 10138, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954888, "name": "Svensk Filmindustri", "creator_id": 12124, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954887, "name": "Tartan Video", "creator_id": 78172, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18373, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FX6sDBGqLZY4bK29S5AFqIMNJE.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Smiles of a summer night (Ingmar Bergman) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42320", "production_places": [{"id": 43, "name": "Sweden", "slug": "sweden"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1955", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1955"}], "labels": [25609]}, {"id": 72913, "acmi_id": "28629", "title": "Smile of Buddha", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "smile-of-buddha", "creator_credit": "Yves Gautier, UNICEF and Office de Radiodiffusion Television Francais", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1970", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>The sparrows of Saigon of the opening song refer to the thousands of homeless and injured children of this city, who are both victims of the war or whose already miserable condition the war has worsened.

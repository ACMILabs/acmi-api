Tian Geng promised to turn in an annual profit of 50 million yuan, if the State Council would approve his reform plans based on the contractual agreement. Tian Geng’s proposal was approved, but his decision to appoint Lan Yumeng as the deputy manager was opposed by the Party Secretary, because Lan had an affair with an engineer, Feng Lu. Tian Geng tried to persuade Feng Lu to stay away from Lan but in vain. Tian Geng devoted himself wholeheartedly to his work and neglected his family. Burdened with the pressure of work and family, Tian Geng had to finance 800 million yuan for the second phase of a project. Tian Geng overrode all objections and made a difficult decision to borrow the money from an international bank.

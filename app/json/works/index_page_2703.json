Documenting some quite spectacular scenery, Palin meets many hospitable and intriguing people from diverse cultural backgrounds - he is even granted an interview with the Dalai Lama. We learn in a pre-trip interview that at sixty years of age Palin is somewhat nervous at the prospect of this adventure but still excited by the idea of discovering new places, none of which he has been to before - quite a feat as this is his sixth televised international journey. A six part television series complete on three DVDs, the set contains over 90 minutes of extra footage.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["06:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Adventure and adventurers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Afghanistan - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Pakistan", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tibet - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travelers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Voyages and travels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Closed captioning", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhist monasteries - Tibet", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Village communities", "History&nbsp;→ Adventure and adventurers", "People&nbsp;→ Dalai Lama XIV, 1935-", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Places&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Places&nbsp;→ Nepal", "Places&nbsp;→ Pakistan", "Places&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929574, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929575, "name": "John Paul Davidson", "creator_id": 80543, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929576, "name": "Roger Mills", "creator_id": 14805, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 929573, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52981", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [34429]}, {"id": 88229, "acmi_id": "310781", "title": "Michael Palin's Hemingway adventure", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "michael-palins-hemingway-adventure", "creator_credit": "BBC, Martha Wailes and David F.

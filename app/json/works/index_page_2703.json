Cao Cao was frightened and enraged by this proposition, since no such surgery had ever been performed before, he was convinced that Hua Tuo was making an attempt to assassinate him and sentenced the physician to death.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nThe film&#8217;s account of the relationship between Hua Tuo and Cao Cao is one that is focused on the innate character differences between the two; both brilliant in their respective fields, highly idealistic, each with their own set of philosophies: Cao Cao&#8217;s sole ambition was to dominate and conquer others, while Hua Tuo believed in peace, universal rights and equality. There is continuous dialogue between the two men with regards to the notion of humanity, morality as well as the importance and inevitability of war. The contrast between the two men is well demonstrated in the narrative.<br />\n(3.5 stars - Mary Chen; May 22, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine, Chinese", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine, Experimental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Public health - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889921, "name": "Shanghai Film Studios", "creator_id": 21146, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889922, "name": "Zhumo Huang", "creator_id": 82525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889923, "name": "Yuan Tao", "creator_id": 82526, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889924, "name": "Fung Do", "creator_id": 82527, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889925, "name": "Rongshen Mao", "creator_id": 82528, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889926, "name": "Heng Xiao", "creator_id": 82529, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889927, "name": "Ganlong Zheng", "creator_id": 82530, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889928, "name": "Gong Xue", "creator_id": 82502, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889929, "name": "Zhumo Huang", "creator_id": 82525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889930, "name": "Hongsheng Wang", "creator_id": 82425, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146428", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [55276], "external_references": []}, {"id": 79476, "acmi_id": "300426", "title": "HSC English: Essay Writing-Text", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hsc-english-essay-writing-text", "creator_credit": "Video Classroom", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1984", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this program, Geoff Shaw, HSC English teacher, provides a strategy for writing English essays on single literature texts.

Hodgkin, one of the world&#8217;s leading painters whose art is admired by both critics and the public, labours over his work for lengthy periods, characteristically producing richly coloured, and sumptuous compositions that spill over into the frame. His work straddles abstraction and representation whilst displaying an awareness of history and the potential for art. Larger scale work such as &#8220;Americana&#8221; and &#8220;After Vuillard&#8221;, demonstrate his concern to engage the viewer in new and challenging ways.

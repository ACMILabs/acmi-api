Set in early 18th century London, this is not a conventional opera with elaborate Italian arias. Gay has instead satirized the idea of classical opera with light popular tunes and characters of common or criminal background, poking fun throughout at the moral standards of politicians and upper classes of society London in general. The singers include Laurence Olivier, Adele Leigh, Jennifer Vyvyan, Edith Coates, Joan Cross, John Cameron, Bruce Boyne and Stanley Holloway. First performed in 1728 at Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields Theatre, the film, director Peter Brook&#8217;s first feature, when first premiered in 1953, received a luke-warm reception. Audiences were not used to operas being adapted and &#8220;tampered&#8221; with to suit a cinematic format. However today it is seen as an entertaining musical film, with adventure and romance laced with a good dash of satire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964114, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964115, "name": "Laurence Olivier", "creator_id": 74595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964116, "name": "Herbert Wilcox", "creator_id": 36466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964117, "name": "Peter Brook", "creator_id": 23071, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964113, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

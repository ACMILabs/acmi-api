In &#8220;Rabid&#8221; a seriously injured victim of a motor cycle accident (Marilyn Chambers), develops a rare form of rabies after undergoing experimental skin graft treatment. As a result she grows a phallic spike in her armpit that triggers a ravenous thirst for human blood. Her infected victims soon become rabid themselves, contaminating others until a whole city is consumed with panic as the population is rapidly devastated. Cronenberg&#8217;s trademark visceral visual effects are less lurid and more creepy than in &#8220;Shivers&#8221;, treading the line between shock and parody without descending into farce.

Spanning 15 years, the film begins with Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier and moves on to concentrate primarily on the original seven Mercury astronauts. The film relates the perils and frustrations of the astronauts, their arduous training and complex personal lives, and the absurd lengths to which they must go to satisfy the public&#8217;s demand for real heroes. Cast includes Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Fred Ward and Barbara Hershey.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Historical films", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Astronauts - United States", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Manned space flight", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Space flight - History", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-right-stuff", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995465, "name": "Philip Kaufman", "creator_id": 24130, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q176126", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995464, "name": "Robert Chartoff", "creator_id": 61932, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q721027", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995463, "name": "Irwin Winkler", "creator_id": 57099, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q950428", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995462, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995461, "name": "The Ladd Company", "creator_id": 68287, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1995460, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49033", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [31141], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91650, "acmi_id": "314798", "title": "For whom the bell tolls", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "for-whom-the-bell-tolls", "creator_credit": "Sam Wood and Paramount Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1943", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1943-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A romantic drama set in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War.

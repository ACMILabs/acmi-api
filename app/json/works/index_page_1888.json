Bernhard is a sardonic and biting comedian who in a series of inspired personas exposes the hypocrisy and shallowness that dominate contemporary American culture. Whether sending up her suburban Jewish upbringing or the excesses of Hollywood stardom, Bernhard&#8217;s stand-up routines reclaim the transgressive bitchiness of camp. &#8220;Without You I&#8217;m Nothing&#8221; achieves much of its power from the sheer force of Bernhard&#8217;s personality. Whether performing a lesbian-tinted &#8220;Me and Mrs Jones&#8221; or stripping to &#8220;Do You Want To Funk?&#8221;, her energy is explosive and exhilarating to watch.

Guy, a bachelor in his thirties is despairing the fact that he cannot meet the perfect woman. Fate intervenes when he meets Lizzie - a beautiful doctor, while he is running around the neighbourhood with a pregnant cat about to give birth. Lizzie isn&#8217;t the cat&#8217;s owner Guy is looking for, but she does take them both in, and together they witness the birth of a litter of kittens. This marks the beginning of a whirlwind romance and the two are soon engaged, much to the delight of their respective families who feared their children would be single forever. There are some pre wedding jitters about Lizzie&#8217;s mother interfering with the wedding plans, however it&#8217;s a teapot that provides the first inkling that their relationship is not the picture of perfection. The majority of the film takes place at Guy and Lizzie&#8217;s wedding day, a day in which Guy is plagued by memories of his previous girlfriend, Jenny (Frances O&#8217;Connor).

Upon the arrival of an Englishman, Anthony Bowles (Charles Dance), who claims to be an archaeologist, he is quick to offer his services as an interpreter and negotiates a temporary lease on an area of land on the island. Pascali&#8217;s second mistake is to introduce the Englishman to Lydia (Helen Mirren), a Viennese painter for whom he nurses an unrequited passion and watches helplessly as they begin a passionate affair. When, by chance Bowles discovers a priceless statue, he invites Pascali to share in his joy, but the offer of genuine friendship goes unnoticed by the ever suspicious Pascali.

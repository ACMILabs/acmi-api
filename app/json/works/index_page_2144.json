Her husband, a university doctor (Robert Coleby), seems oblivious to her anguish and just wants the shower fixed. Disturbing and unsettling in mood, set in a high-rise apartment block with large balconies that feel lifeless and unconducive to a happy life, Jilly plots to play the plumber at his own game and foils his plans.

The Cars that ate Paris: Peter Weir&#8217;s directorial feature film debut is an offbeat horror story/fantasy about a small Australian country town called Paris.

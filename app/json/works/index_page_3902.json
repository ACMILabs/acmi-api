In 2000 he began working on restoring key scenes, deleted in 1979, identifying those that expounded upon his themes of military madness and moral degradation. New scenes include: Willard&#8217;s seduction by a widow after attending a dinner at the home of a French plantation owner, the sumptuousness of which speaks of yearning for an idealised past and reflects Willard&#8217;s retreat from the present; the Playboy bunnies become stranded and Willard&#8217;s crew offer them fuel in exchange for sex, compounding the sense of the military&#8217;s ethical deprivation; Kurtz extrapolates upon the insanity of war, a philosophical scene linked to the denouement. Coppola&#8217;s original work won numerous accolades, but many critics questioned the rationale behind &#8220;Redux&#8221; and theorised that it perhaps reflected his failure to produce engaging work throughout the 1990s.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Anti-war works", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Vietnam War, 1961-1975", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Vietnam War, 1961-1975 - Motion pictures and the war", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 817254, "name": "Omni Zoetrope", "creator_id": 23119, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817255, "name": "Francis Ford Coppola", "creator_id": 503, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817253, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51636", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33353]}, {"id": 82071, "acmi_id": "303205", "title": "Apocalypse now", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "apocalypse-now", "creator_credit": "Francis Ford Coppola and Omni Zoetrope", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s stunning vision of man&#8217;s heart of darkness, revealed through the particular madness of the Vietnam War.

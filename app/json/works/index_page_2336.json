Valeh&#8217;s spiritual transcendence is rendered obliquely, but unlike, for example, the spiritual cinema of Tarkovsky, spiritual concerns do not outweigh the importance of politics or of Valeh&#8217;s terror of his increasing madness. As the chilling final scene makes clear - in a stunningly executed balletic sequence which again recalls Gavras - the savagery of the Shah&#8217;s regime demands agitation and revolt. &#8220;Boycott&#8221; is a film that veers from moments of stark beauty to thriller melodramatics, but it is a crucial work in the development of a key contemporary director.

Juxtaposed with footage from inside drag king bar Club Confidential, and the transgender-friendly Tom Waddell Clinic, these subjects openly discuss their backgrounds, sexuality and fascination with gender bending, revealing just how constrictive traditional observations about the dual nature of gender have been. Excerpts from films such as Annie Sprinkle&#8217;s Linda, Les, and Annie (1990), Texas Tomboy&#8217;s Alienator (1997), Monika Treut&#8217;s Max (1992), Jordy Jones&#8217; Injectible Man (1998), and Shu Lea Cheang&#8217;s web feature Brandon (1998) are also interspersed with the interview footage. This documentary had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival Panorama in February 1999.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Germany", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Femininity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex differences", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hormones", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hormones - Physiological effect", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medical care", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sex (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Surgery"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/gendernauts-a-journey-through-shifting-identities", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997206, "name": "Monika Treut", "creator_id": 76511, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q69810", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997205, "name": "Hyena Films", "creator_id": 33234, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143905", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50712", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32677]}]}

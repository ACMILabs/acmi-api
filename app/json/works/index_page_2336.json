To help Dostoyevsky achieve this deadline, Anna (Jodhi May), an impoverished student desperate for money to help support her parents, is hired as his stenographer. But Anna finds to her dismay that this writer is not an easy person to work with. He is belligerent, cantankerous and condescending with no respect or sensitivity towards Anna&#8217;s feelings. However as the days go by, Anna finds herself inextricably caught up with Dostoyvesky&#8217;s imagination and the story he is creating - a tale of a young couple at the Casino in the fictional German resort Roulettenburg where the young man&#8217;s gambling obsession has put him into debt. The intertwining of reality and fiction eventually leads to a strange erotic attraction between Dostoyevsky and Anna. In real life, Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina became Dostoyvesky&#8217;s second wife and it is her written reminiscences that have allowed a glimpse into Dostoyevsky&#8217;s creative life and the eventual making of this film.

This romantic comedy places the rubbery-faced Clunes (from TV&#8217;s Men behaving badly) in all kind of sticky situations as well as pairing him opposite the comely Carmen (Anna Chancellor), who assists Neil in his quest (and provides an alternate love interest). The film features an array of exaggerated types (repressed sexual deviants, wry octogenarians, duplicitous friends) to draw laughs as it places Neil in increasingly farcical scenarios. Cast includes Michael Praed, Michele Winstanley, Kate Byers, Sarah Winman, David Kossoff and Helena McCarthy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Weddings", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2308346, "name": "Martin Clunes", "creator_id": 80155, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2631586", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308343, "name": "Philippa Braithwaite", "creator_id": 29773, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q94632990", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308341, "name": "Big Deal Picures", "creator_id": 34830, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270914", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50670", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32643]}, {"id": 93139, "acmi_id": "316516", "title": "Pretty woman (Director's cut)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "pretty-woman-directors-cut", "creator_credit": "Garry Marshall, Arnon Milchan, Steven Reuther, Silver Screen Partners IV and Touchstone Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47890, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q207954"}], "brief_description": "<p>Directed by Garry Marshall &#8220;Pretty woman&#8221; was the film that helped make a star of American actress Julia Roberts.

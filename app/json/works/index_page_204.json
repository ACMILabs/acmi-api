Janet Jones (Vera Ellen) is a chorus girl mistaken for the fiancee of local multi-millionaire B.G. Bruno. As a result she is promoted to leading lady and showered in gifts from local dress stores. Rumours drift back to Bruno about Miss Jones and when he calls on her she mistakes him for a reporter, Charlie. As Charlie/Bruno woos Janet complications ensue in a classic case of mistaken identity. The film features numerous song and dance sequences, many of which are in the style of ballet.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/happy-go-lovely", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997593, "name": "Bruce Humberstone", "creator_id": 25611, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2420942", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997592, "name": "Marcel Hellman", "creator_id": 30623, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q215151", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997591, "name": "Associated British Picture Corporation", "creator_id": 26967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997590, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50932", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1951", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1951"}], "labels": [32882], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93378, "acmi_id": "316803", "title": "Stevie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stevie", "creator_credit": "Robert Enders and Bowden Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1978", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Born in Yorkshire, England in 1902, Florence Margaret &#8220;Stevie&#8221; Smith began writing poetry in her twenties.

It explores the loving relationship between Stevie (Glenda Jackson) and her Aunt (Mona Washbourne), the romantic liaisons in Stevie&#8217;s life, and the eventual fame that her poetic writings bring, using flashbacks and direct dialogue with the audience by Stevie and &#8220;The Man&#8221; (Trevor Howard). This is very much a stage play on film with not a lot of cinematic expression or extravagant landscapes, confined most of the time to the living room scenes of the house where Stevie and her Aunt dwell. However, it is the literary merit and the art of language which perhaps give this film its appeal, not to mention the excellent performances by some of Britain&#8217;s most highly acclaimed actors.

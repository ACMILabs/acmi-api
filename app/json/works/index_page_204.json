When Johnny Case (Cary Grant) returns from a skiing holiday to visit his fiance Julie Seton (Doris Nolan) he is shocked to discover she is very very rich. Soon Julie&#8217;s father is mapping out their lives, but Julie&#8217;s non-conformist sister Linda (Katherine Hepburn) and alcholic brother Ned (Lew Ayres) think that Johnny&#8217;s fresh enthusiasm for life could be the antidote for their father&#8217;s tiranic rule. Hepburn and Grant give fantastic performances and Cukor&#8217;s direction ensures that this is a sparkling romantic comedy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/holiday", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954981, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954982, "name": "Everett Riskin", "creator_id": 77678, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954983, "name": "George Cukor", "creator_id": 71800, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42446", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [25724], "external_references": [{"id": 785, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q528473"}, {"id": 4412, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "16274"}]}]}

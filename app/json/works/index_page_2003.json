The program is structured in a question and answer format and focuses on key performers, characters, and directors: Wong Fei Hung, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tsui Hark, Ang Lee, Sammo Hung, John Woo and Michelle Yeoh to name a few. It also looks at the prominent role of women in the genre, the contribution of the Shaw Brother&#8217;s company in the 1950s, the influence of Japanese cinema (in particular the work of Akira Kurosawa), American cinema, and the direction of martial arts films in the 21st Century. Boasting an abundance of film clips and interviews with (unfortunately unnamed by visual clues) practitioners of the trade, this DVD provides an excellent history of the genre.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "German", "Italian", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Asia - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 928653, "name": "Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment", "creator_id": 36069, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928654, "name": "Joni Levin", "creator_id": 25374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928655, "name": "Keith Clarke", "creator_id": 36070, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 928652, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52035", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33669]}, {"id": 64901, "acmi_id": "000546", "title": "The Art director", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-art-director", "creator_credit": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1950", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Explains the work of the art director in the production of a feature motion picture.

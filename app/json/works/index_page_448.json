The open-air Olympic Pool (formally known as the State Swimming Centre) was built by the Melbourne City Council, and opened in Batman Avenue, Melbourne in 1935.

This is presumably to secure the cloth covering on the ends of the boards (this can be more clearly seen in a following sequence of people diving from these boards).</p>\n<p>00:07:04:00 we see people using the lower diving-boards, with part of the Melbourne CBD skyline behind them, including a clear view of the T&amp;G Building (Temperance and General Building).</p>\n<p>00:07:34:00 there appears to be a race – as other swimmers have once again cleared the pool, and some are seen applauding – where some contestants are swimming in backstroke and some in freestyle (also known as the ‘Australian Crawl’).</p>\n<p>00:07:54:00 a sequence filmed in slow-motion captures the contortions of diver’s bodies as they execute more complex dives.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film shows people enjoying the water and sunshine at the former State Swimming Centre (now demolished) in Batman Avenue, Melbourne. Being 1943, those enjoying the Olympic-sized pool and its facilities include soldiers in uniform as well as those displaying the various swimwear styles of the 1940s. There are sequences of diving from the high diving-boards, underwater scenes, and people sunbaking, swimming and enjoying themselves bring the reel to a close. Throughout the reel, many people react to the camera by smiling and posing for it, while others appear less enthusiastic about being photographed. The footage also shows glimpses of landmark buildings of Melbourne at the time.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:</p>\n<p>00:00:09:00 title &#8216;Olympic Pool Melbourne 1943&#8217;.

Caught up in a demonstration by women protesting the right to work, the girl and her mother drenched by water cannon take refuge off the street with a young boy (who will again in the future come to their aid). The mother works at the local hospital but is soon unable to continue as the grip of the evil enforced by the Taliban intensifies and women without a man present are not even allowed on the street. Hungry and unable to work the mother disguises her daughter as a boy and, as a boy, she gains employment with a sympathetic shop owner. The girl, now &#8220;Osama&#8221;, is forcibly taken from the shop to be indoctrinated with other young boys into the extremist philosophy of the Taliban. Her true sex is soon discovered and her sorrowful plight leaves the viewer totally despairing.

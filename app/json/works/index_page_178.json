Strand broke with the romantic pictorialist tradition to create a direct, dynamic photographic aesthetic. He was one of the first American artists to fully understand cubism, translating its vocabulary to the medium of photography. From 1914 onwards, Strand&#8217;s groundbreaking work encompassed abstract compositions, candid portraits, extreme close-ups of nature and documentation of social conditions. He was also a filmmaker and in 1921 he made America&#8217;s first avant-garde film, &#8220;Manhatta&#8221;, with painter Charles Sheeler. His growing political commitment, especially during and after the Great Depression, led him to embrace filmmaking as a means of political expression. In 1934 he became involved with a group of radical New York filmmakers, collaborating with Pare Lorentz on &#8220;The Plow that broke the plains&#8221; in 1936 and with Leo Hurwitz on &#8220;Native land&#8221;, a visually remarkable indictment of American civil rights abuses in 1941.

Jubei is a masterless ninja who travels the land alone, hiring his services to those with gold or a worthy cause. An evil conspiracy is at work to overthrow the Government. Jubei reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious old man and the beautiful but tragic Kagero, in an effort to defeat the Shogun of the dark and his demonic cronies. Not surprisingly this is a struggle that involves huge amounts of action, violence, bloodletting, sex, supernatural powers and transmogrification. The animation is an impressive though slightly incongruous blend of detailed architecture, evocative landscape and highly stylized action figures. It will also interest followers of popular culture.

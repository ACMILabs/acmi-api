Features the voices of Kevin Bacon, Bridget Fonda, Bob Hoskins and Phil Collins.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal films", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2107403, "name": "Simon Wells", "creator_id": 77828, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q27419", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2107397, "name": "Steve Hickner", "creator_id": 78001, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3498952", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2107396, "name": "Amblin Entertainment", "creator_id": 67925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2107395, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2107393, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41621", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [25109]}]}

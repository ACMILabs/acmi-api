Hosted by Frank Sinatra, this tribute, both informative and entertaining (winning an Emmy Award in 1975 for Outstanding Television Programme), celebrates his career with a top line-up of stars contributing anecdotes along with excerpts from many of his films. Frank Sinatra delivers a wonderful version of &#8216;My Way&#8217; with lyrics written to honour Cagney. Guest speakers include: Mae Clarke, Doris Day, Kirk Douglas, Frank Gorshin, Charlton Heston, Bob Hope, Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Ronald Reagan, George Segal, George C.

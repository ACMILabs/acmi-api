Stowing away on a truck travelling from the South to the North, Bashu meets Nai, a woman who shelters him. Gradually Nai accepts him as a son and tries to initiate him into the ways of life in the region. They discover new grounds for a closer spiritual relationship when Nai keeps the boy despite objections from relatives and neighbours. Nai&#8217;s husband returns home, approves of his wife&#8217;s decision and adopts Bashu. This subtly crafted film was banned in Iran for six years and was only released after the Iran/Iraq war. Starring S. Taslimi, P. Poor Hosseini and A. Afravian.

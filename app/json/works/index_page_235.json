In the pilot series agent Dana Scully is assigned to a new project- the X-files - reserved for unsolved cases with a paranormal twist. The man leading these investigations is agent Fox Mulder or Spooky Mulder as he is known by his mocking co-workers. During the first season creator Chris Carter guides us through a labyrinth of secret plots, covert organizations within organizations, and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracy theories. Throughout the first season we are also introduced to a slew of mysterious recurring characters such as Mulder&#8217;s secret FBI source Deep throat (Jerry Hardin) (Ep. 2 &#8216;Deep throat&#8217;); the government watchdog group, &#8216;The Lone gunmen&#8217; (a kind of think tank for all things conspiracy based); and the menacing &#8216;cancer man&#8217; (William B. Davis). Part of the show&#8217;s popularity is due to the unusual relationship between Scully and Mulder. Carter presents a platonic relationship between a man and a woman with all its subtle shifts and changes without having to resort to the standard resolution of romance and sex. Actors Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are key to the shows success, creating genuine chemistry and a subtle sexual tension between them. Through the 24 episodes that make up season one we discover why Mulder has invested so much of his life in investigating these unexplained phenomena (Ep. 4 &#8216;Conduit&#8217;), while also witnessing Scully&#8217;s gradual journey from cynic to true believer. Chris Carter&#8217;s original agenda with the &#8220;X-Files&#8221; was to create a program in the vein of the 70s cult horror series &#8220;The Night stalker.&#8221; His vision became a television phenomenon which ran for nine years, was made into a feature film and generated a fiercely loyal fan base with hundreds of web-sites dedicated to the show and its characters.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>X-files = X files.

Because of the importance of this 2000 years old Irrigation system to the development of Sichuan and the Yangtze River region, Li Bing became a great Chinese cultural icon, hailed as a great civil administrator and Water conservation expert. In Chinese mythology, he is known as the vanquisher of the River God, whom the people believed to have caused all the turbulent rainfalls and flooding in the Sichuan region. When he arrived in Shu, Li Bing witnessed the sufferings of local people from frequent flooding of Minjiang River.

The dynamics between peasants and the ruling class are also highlighted; the hardships that the peasants face, resulting from prolonged flooding and the tyranny inflicted by the ruling class. Li Bing&#8217;s struggle between private desires/ moral beliefs versus his obligations to the state is dramatically played out within the narrative.

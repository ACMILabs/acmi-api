Jorge Perugorria and Vladimir Cruz are excellent as the two friends and Mirta Ibarra steals every scene she is in as a vivacious and sexy Cuban woman who refuses to allow Latin machismo to dictate her life and choices.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Censorship", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cuba - Politics and government", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Cuba", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/strawberry-and-chocolate", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1967398, "name": "Juan Carlos Tabio", "creator_id": 77965, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3045892", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1967397, "name": "Tomas Gutierrez Alea", "creator_id": 27477, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q722461", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1967396, "name": "Miguel Mendoza", "creator_id": 27476, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1967395, "name": "Tabasco Films", "creator_id": 27475, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1967394, "name": "Imcine", "creator_id": 27474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1967393, "name": "Cuban Institute of Arts and Film Industry", "creator_id": 27473, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1967392, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41482", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 199, "name": "Cuba", "slug": "cuba"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [24973], "external_references": []}, {"id": 85482, "acmi_id": "306882", "title": "Jesus of Montreal", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jesus-of-montreal", "creator_credit": "Denys Arcand, Pierre Gendron, Roger Frappier, National Film Board of Canada and Max Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Daniel is a young actor who, like most of his friends, flits from commercials to stage to television trying to find work.

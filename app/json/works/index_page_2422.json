The two inventors raced each other to patent their technology, but Eastman received his patent first and began mass-producing film for Thomas Edison.</p>\n<p>These strips are the most commonly used film gauges: 35mm is the standard; 16mm and 8mm are favoured by amateur filmmakers; and the wide, high-resolution 70mm is most commonly used for epics by Hollywood directors.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Moving Pictures&nbsp;→ MI-04.

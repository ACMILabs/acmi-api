Mr Arnaud is a man near the end of his life, financially secure but dwelling on past regrets, both personal and professional. The bond between them intensifies and as Nelly embarks on an affair with a dashing young publisher, Vincent (Jean-Hugues Anglade), Nelly and Arnoud&#8217;s relationship is threatened. Created from an original script, &#8220;Nelly and Mr Arnaud&#8221; is a gently observed tale about friendship and the vagaries of the heart. This was the last film directed by Claude Sautet before his death.

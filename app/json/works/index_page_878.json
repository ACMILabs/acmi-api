From 1938 to 1942 Laszlo Ratz - ensign of the Second Hungarian Army, first battalion of the 18th Szekszard infantry - documented his family on 9.5 mm within this toubled milieu. Through Peter Forgacs&#8217; recontextualisation of Ratz&#8217; material we are now permitted to gaze upon the unseen, the private view of a bloody war. By recording his personal history without an &#8216;ideological filter&#8217;, Ratz captured historical moments such as the Ukranian march and the final approach to the bloody Korotoyak/Voronezh Soviet front. Ratz shot until the eve of the catastrophe that befell the Hungarian Army at the river Don.

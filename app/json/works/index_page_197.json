Once born, Kirikou seeks about healing his village - principally from the curse that an ill-tempered sorceress has placed on the village including drying up the wells and eating up the men-folk. In his bid to confront the sorceress and see the end to his tribe&#8217;s woes, Kirikou undertakes a perilous journey meeting an array of colourful beings and jungle creatures. The charm of the narrative is that it presents from a child&#8217;s perspective with uncomplicated views on life, unsullied by conjecture and misguided beliefs.

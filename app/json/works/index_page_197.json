Mel Gibson stars as Max Rockatansky, a good cop made mad by the death of his wife and child and the hands of a gang of feral bikies. The film follows Max as he embarks on a personal vendetta to avenge the death of his family, armed with anger, a gun and his car - &#8220;the last of the V-8 interceptors&#8221;. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; has a much-imitated visual and thematic style - gang members are clad in filthy rags with maimed bodies; the landscape is bleak and featureless; camps are transitory pit-stops between war zones; and machines rule their owners. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221;, with its ordinary hero and car culture narrative, fits neatly into the zeitgeist of 1970s filmmaking. A nihilistic road movie, fuelled by male angst, &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; is a thrilling, truly original film that remains a highlight of Australian film history.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Automobiles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motor vehicles", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Automobiles - Social aspects", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mad-max", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 947981, "name": "Mad Max Films", "creator_id": 1986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947982, "name": "Kennedy Miller Productions", "creator_id": 66822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947983, "name": "Byron Kennedy", "creator_id": 66841, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947984, "name": "George Miller", "creator_id": 66844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 947980, "name": "Video Classroom", "creator_id": 20016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 947985, "name": "Mel Gibson", "creator_id": 76439, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 947986, "name": "Joanne Samuel", "creator_id": 76442, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 947987, "name": "Hugh Keays-Byrne", "creator_id": 76205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35169", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [18849], "external_references": [{"id": 4783, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "9659"}]}, {"id": 92959, "acmi_id": "316303", "title": "Mad Dog and Glory", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mad-dog-and-glory-dvd", "creator_credit": "Universal Pictures, Barbara de Fina, Martin Scorsese and John McNaughton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1993", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Robert De Niro and Uma Thurman star as title characters Mad Dog and Glory in this unassuming romantic comedy.

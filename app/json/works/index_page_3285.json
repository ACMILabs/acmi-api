Stellar cast includes: Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Danny Glover and Bill Murray.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 819747, "name": "Wes Anderson", "creator_id": 2980, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q223687", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1809211, "name": "Barry Mendel", "creator_id": 72105, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q809074", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 819744, "name": "American Empirical Pictures", "creator_id": 2965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 819745, "name": "Touchstone Pictures", "creator_id": 70084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 819743, "name": "Buena Vista Home Entertainment", "creator_id": 72714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52332", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33922]}, {"id": 89321, "acmi_id": "312029", "title": "The Royal river", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-royal-river", "creator_credit": "Kenneth J.

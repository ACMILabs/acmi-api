As we follow his career we also travel through jazz history, witnessing rare footage and recordings from other jazz greats, like Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and Billy Eckstine&#8217;s Orchestra, Ben Webster, Charlie Parker, Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen and Bud Powell. Don McGlynn also includes interviews with Bernard Tavernier about Gordon&#8217;s involvement in the film &#8220;Round midnight&#8221;, including footage from Dexter Gordon&#8217;s screen test for the part for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. This film not only includes some fantastic music, it also gives a wonderful sense of Gordon&#8217;s warmth and humour whilst dealing honestly with his use of drugs and his years of exile in Denmark.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Improvisation (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "People&nbsp;→ Gordon, Dexter, 1923-", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915329, "name": "Chase Productions", "creator_id": 29520, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915330, "name": "Leonard Melone", "creator_id": 80683, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915331, "name": "Don McGlynn", "creator_id": 28996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915332, "name": "Don McGlynn", "creator_id": 28996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 915328, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52038", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [33672], "external_references": []}, {"id": 98573, "acmi_id": "508374", "title": "Devrim", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "devrim", "creator_credit": "Migrant Women's Film Group, Amelia Flores, Zynet Kesting and Mandy King", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1984", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Looks at the situation of a young Turkish woman who finds herself in an impossible marriage.

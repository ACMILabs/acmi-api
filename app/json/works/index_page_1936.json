Maurice prepares an other heist with Silien, whom the &#8216;milieu&#8217; (the underworld) suspects to be a &#8216;doulos&#8217; (an informer). &#8216;Le Doulos&#8217; is one of Melville&#8217;s many homages to American Cinema. The sets for the offices of Commissaire Clain were modelled on those used by Ruben Mamoulian in &#8216;City Streets&#8217;. For the confrontation scene between Silien and Clain, Melville directed a 9 min. 39 sec. shot with a 360 degree pan.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Georges de Beauregard ; director, Jean-Pierre Melville ; writers, Jean-Pierre Melville, Elisabeth Rappeneau ; photography, Nicolas Hayer ; music, Paul Misraki ; art direction, Daniel Gueret, Pierre Charron ; assistant directior, Vol<br />\nCast: Jean-Paul Belmondo, Serge Reggiani, Jean Desailly, Fabienne Dali, Michel Piccoli, Marcel Cuvelier, Jack Leonard, Aime de March, Monique Hennessy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2561194, "name": "Jean-Pierre Melville", "creator_id": 28889, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q168693", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2561193, "name": "Georges de Beauregard", "creator_id": 71632, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q924396", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "147043", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1962", "notes": "", "to_year": "1962"}], "labels": [55804]}, {"id": 116309, "acmi_id": "X000521", "title": "Leon Morin, Pretre = Leon Morin, Priest", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "leon-morin-pretre-leon-morin-priest", "creator_credit": "Jean-Pierre Melville, Carlo Ponti and Georges de Beauregard", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1961", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1961-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Aiming successfully for a wider audience in 1961, the neglected French independent Jean-Pierre Melville (&#8216;Les enfants terribles&#8217;, &#8216;Le samourai&#8217;) adapted Beatrix Beck&#8217;s autobiographical novel, set in a French village during World War II, about a young woman falling in love with a handsome, radical young priest who is fully aware of his power over her.

This is supported by a sequence in the film from Blank&#8217;s documentary &#8216;Burden of Dreams&#8217;, featuring an interview with Werner Herzog on shoot for &#8216;Fitzcarraldo&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Expressionism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Herzog, Werner, 1942-", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Herzog, Werner, 1942-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 875281, "name": "Abel Ferrara", "creator_id": 29983, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q262608", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1813691, "name": "Mary Kane", "creator_id": 31359, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q13562351", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 875279, "name": "Maverick", "creator_id": 27084, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315044", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46534", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [28916]}, {"id": 84243, "acmi_id": "305548", "title": "Dangerous creatures (PC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dangerous-creatures-pc", "creator_credit": "Microsoft Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Welcome to the interactive world of dangerous creatures!

Although filmed shortly after Part One in 1946, the film was suppressed and was not released until 1958. It is also the last film Eisenstein made. In the trilogy Eisenstein planned to show the inner struggle of the first Czar of Russia and founder of the Russian state, in his effort to consolidate the unity of the realm against its enemies at home - the boyars or feudal noblemen - and neighbouring powers. Part Two takes up the story of Ivan the Terrible (Nikolai Cherkasov) upon his return to Moscow from Alexandrov. The complex story is full of intrigue, high level political in-fighting, family resentment and suspicion, and assassination plot, executions and murder in the cathedral. Two reels of the original were filmed in colour. The banquet scene towards the end of the film was Eisenstein&#8217;s first use of colour stock. In Russian with English subtitles.

It tells of a unique and special friendship between two young boys, Abraham (Roma Alexandrovitch), a nine year-old Jewish boy and Ivan (Sacha Iakovlev), a fourteen year-old Catholic boy, and their determination to remain best friends as religious prejudices begin to surface in the Polish community and within Abraham&#8217;s own family.

Soon enough the malicious vamp has turned everyones life upside down, taking off with her brothers boyfriend and his dead ex-lovers ashes. Writer and director Don Roos has fashioned a sharp witty film which inventively uses Dedee&#8217;s voice over narration to plead her case to the audience and to confound our expectations of what she might possibly be thinking next. Ricci is wonderfully droll and jaded in the title role but not to be undone is Lisa Kudrow as the bitter and suspicious sister of Bill&#8217;s dead lover.

Like Bacon&#8217;s confronting yet compelling portraits, John Maybury&#8217;s film intensely focuses on its subject - revelling in distortion and pain. The film follows the turbulent, sado-masochistic relationship Bacon (Derek Jacobi) had with George Dwyer (Daniel Craig), who he meets when he accidently stumbles upon Dwyer attempting to burgle Bacon&#8217;s meagre apartment. Francis simply says to George: &#8220;Take off your clothes. Come to bed and you can have whatever you want&#8221;. The relationship has a destructive effect on the passive George who feels uncomfortable with Bacon&#8217;s eccentric friends (Tilda Swinton is especially creepy as one of this coterie), and who is continually tortured by Bacon&#8217;s sadistic enjoyment of pain and suffering. Derek Jacobi and Daniel Craig are excellent as the two main characters.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Bacon, Francis, 1909-", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sadism", "People&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Bacon, Francis, 1909-", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/love-is-the-devil-study-for-a-portrait-of-francis-bacon", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1991771, "name": "John Maybury", "creator_id": 78544, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3182021", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991770, "name": "Chiara Menage", "creator_id": 61006, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q94524144", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991769, "name": "British Film Institute", "creator_id": 86051, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991768, "name": "BBC Film Unit", "creator_id": 7251, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1991767, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43909", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [26961], "external_references": []}, {"id": 87462, "acmi_id": "309402", "title": "French cancan", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "french-cancan", "creator_credit": "Jean Renoir, Louis Wipf and Franco London Film (Paris)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1955", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1955-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Beautifully photographed, this comedy-drama chronicles the revival of Paris&#8217; most notorious dance as it tells the story of a theater producer who turns a humble washerwoman into a star at the Moulin Rouge.

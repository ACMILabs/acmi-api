First the city is bombed by an air raid and then it is overrun by thousands of foot soldiers. All of the villagers retreat, abandoning their burning houses after the bombings. Mao asserts that he will not leave the city until he knows for certain that the rest of the city’s population has safely evacuated, although eventually he is persuaded.

The name of the secret group is the Kunlun Column. Their plan is to divide their forces into four separate groups, sending Mao with one of them in an attempt to relocate him to a safer location. Mao joins his troops and embarks on a vast journey through the mountains and across extremely rough terrain. He is depicted as an equal to his soldiers and is shown walking and socialising with all ranks of his army.<br />\nChiang Kai-Shek decides to buy extremely technologically advanced war instruments from the US government officials and uses them to locate exactly where Mao is and determine where he is going. The equipment informs the Nationalist Party that Mao and his followers are heading towards Russia to seek shelter from the applied communist forces led by Joseph Stalin. The Nationalists immediately send their highly trained army named ‘Division 36’ to capture Mao.<br />\nThe Nationalist army travel through the harsh conditions of the desert and when they make it to the other side they are absolutely exhausted. They plan a large-scale sneak attack but even after their fervent tracking efforts are unable to locate the communist army. Mao and his army are strategically hiding in the mountain ranges and when they see the Nationalist Party lurking directionless, they launch an organised and vicious attack that completely wipes out the notorious ‘Division 36’. Mao and his followers rejoice in their landslide victory over the Nationalist army.<br />\nAfter the battle the members of the Kunlum Column no longer need to conceal their identity and come out of hiding. They meet with Mao at a Buddhist temple and are thrilled to be reunited. At the temple Mao draws a stick from a monk that is said to predict the future – the stick reads “most lucky”.

The opening sequence depicts Mao speaking in front of the Communist Party, reporting that the leader of the Nationalist Party, Chiang Kai-Shek, has violated the peace treaty in place between the two parties. Mao presumes that this means the Nationalist Party will soon attack yet strongly claims that he will persevere through all of the pressure of war.<br />\nThe following scene shows Yan’an, the city that Mao is residing in, being hit by a surprise attack led by Chiang Kai-Shek and his army. First the city is bombed by an air raid and then it is overrun by thousands of foot soldiers. All of the villagers retreat, abandoning their burning houses after the bombings. Mao asserts that he will not leave the city until he knows for certain that the rest of the city’s population has safely evacuated, although eventually he is persuaded.

The Western world first got a clear view of the main base of the Communist Party of China through Edgar Snow&#8217;s Red Star Over China. Snow was also the first person to present  Mao as the main leader, as he was previously seen as just a guerrilla leader. Snow&#8217;s book, along with Pearl Buck&#8217;s &#8216;The Good Earth&#8217;, was the most influential book on Western understanding and sympathy for China in the 1930s. Snow recounts the months that he spent with the Chinese Red Army in the summer and fall of 1936. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports of what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Snow&#8217;s status as an international journalist not previously identified with the communist movement gave his reports the stamp of authenticity. The glowing pictures of life in the communist areas contrasted with the gloom and corruption of the Nationalist government. Many Chinese learned about Mao and the communist movement from the almost immediate translations of Mao&#8217;s autobiography, and readers in North America and Europe, especially those with liberal views, were heartened to learn of a movement which they interpreted as being anti-Fascist and progressive. Snow reported clearly Mao&#8217;s new United Front policy as one which would leave violent class struggles behind. Although Snow made clear that Mao&#8217;s ultimate aim was control of China, many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were &#8220;agrarian reformers&#8221;.

Snow is portrayed as a brave and unconventional character. The choice of representing the Snows&#8217; heroism through a female figure can be linked to the ideological underpinnings of Communist China. For centuries before the early 1900s, women were greatly deprived of rights and were present mainly to serve men. Women served as slaves, concubines, and prostitutes. It was Mao who established some equality between the two genders; he believed that the enforcement of gender equality could make China a world power. Within his reign, he shifted the oppression of Chinese women from producing for the home to producing for the state. Husbands were not allowed to abuse their wives, have concubines, or use prostitutes. Marriages could no longer be arranged, wives with unbound feet were encouraged, and divorce was made easier to obtain. Both sexes were forced to wear the same gender neutral padded clothing. These changes initially gave females an increasing sense of self-confidence as they were encouraged to join the work force, become a communist official, and pursue educational opportunities. This indeed was in stark contrast to centuries of being less than second class citizens. Women willingly followed Mao in 1958 with his provision of day-care and soup kitchens to push the patriotic &#8220;iron woman&#8221; into longer work hours for the benefit of the nation.

Snow&#8217;s book, along with Pearl Buck&#8217;s &#8216;The Good Earth&#8217;, was the most influential book on Western understanding and sympathy for China in the 1930s. Snow recounts the months that he spent with the Chinese Red Army in the summer and fall of 1936. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports of what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Snow&#8217;s status as an international journalist not previously identified with the communist movement gave his reports the stamp of authenticity. The glowing pictures of life in the communist areas contrasted with the gloom and corruption of the Nationalist government. Many Chinese learned about Mao and the communist movement from the almost immediate translations of Mao&#8217;s autobiography, and readers in North America and Europe, especially those with liberal views, were heartened to learn of a movement which they interpreted as being anti-Fascist and progressive. Snow reported clearly Mao&#8217;s new United Front policy as one which would leave violent class struggles behind. Although Snow made clear that Mao&#8217;s ultimate aim was control of China, many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were &#8220;agrarian reformers&#8221;. Many critics refer to Snow&#8217;s accounts as &#8220;myths&#8221;, which presents a romanticized and partial view; in the West, it is often blamed for the rise of Mao&#8217;s communism.<br />\nHelen Foster Snow was an American journalist who reported from China in the 1930s on the developing revolution in China and the Korean independence movement. While, like her husband, Edgar Snow, she was never a member of the Chinese or American Communist Party, she was sympathetic to the revolutionaries in China, whom she compared favourably to the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek. In the late 1940s, critics grouped her with the China Hands as one of those responsible for the &#8220;loss of China&#8221;, one who went beyond sympathy to active support of Mao&#8217;s revolution.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nIt is interesting that the film focuses on Helen Snow&#8217;s experiences in China instead of her husband&#8217;s. Snow is portrayed as a brave and unconventional character. The choice of representing the Snows&#8217; heroism through a female figure can be linked to the ideological underpinnings of Communist China. For centuries before the early 1900s, women were greatly deprived of rights and were present mainly to serve men. Women served as slaves, concubines, and prostitutes. It was Mao who established some equality between the two genders; he believed that the enforcement of gender equality could make China a world power. Within his reign, he shifted the oppression of Chinese women from producing for the home to producing for the state. Husbands were not allowed to abuse their wives, have concubines, or use prostitutes. Marriages could no longer be arranged, wives with unbound feet were encouraged, and divorce was made easier to obtain. Both sexes were forced to wear the same gender neutral padded clothing. These changes initially gave females an increasing sense of self-confidence as they were encouraged to join the work force, become a communist official, and pursue educational opportunities. This indeed was in stark contrast to centuries of being less than second class citizens. Women willingly followed Mao in 1958 with his provision of day-care and soup kitchens to push the patriotic &#8220;iron woman&#8221; into longer work hours for the benefit of the nation. Again, this can be interpreted as the filmmaker&#8217;s attempt at glorifying Communism and its ideologies.<br />\nThe narrative can be likened to classical Hollywood spy films and old espionage serials. At face value, the film is uncomplicated and easy to watch; although the characters and the dialogue seem a little outdated and camp.<br />\n(3 stars - Mary Chen; May 22, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - not for children (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - Civil war, 1945-1949", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2088640, "name": "Shishu Yu", "creator_id": 82578, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299362", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2088639, "name": "Jia Wang", "creator_id": 82577, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079226", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2088637, "name": "August First Film Studio", "creator_id": 34754, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q10872932", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2088651, "name": "John Perry", "creator_id": 82585, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126357", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088650, "name": "Gao Fa", "creator_id": 82584, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040089", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088649, "name": "Kang Li", "creator_id": 82583, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271478", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088647, "name": "Debbie Gates", "creator_id": 82582, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078941", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088645, "name": "Ke Yang", "creator_id": 82581, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299398", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088643, "name": "Hua Shong", "creator_id": 82580, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036619", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2088642, "name": "Bicheng Bi", "creator_id": 82579, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146436", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [55284]}, {"id": 113983, "acmi_id": "B1000089", "title": "Sept Visions Fugitives", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sept-visions-fugitives", "creator_credit": "Bernard Bats and Robert Cahen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, black and white and colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Sept Visions Fugitives was produced in China.

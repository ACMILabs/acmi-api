The film&#8217;s power derives from a series of contrasts between Danton and Robespierre on the level of characterisation and staging as much as ideology.

In such scenes the theatricality of the dialogue, rendered all the more artificial by the dubbing of Pszoniak, is at odds with Depardieu&#8217;s more relaxed and gestural performance, which recalls the more enigmatic power of the silent cinema. The political conflict between the two is underlined not just by the contrast in styles of performance, but also by Wajda&#8217;s mise en scene, so that Danton&#8217;s clothes and rooms are red, Robespierre&#8217;s blue.

As the demons of his past return to haunt Rafi, escape is impossible; personal tragedy is inevitable.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>With relentless momentum director Stephen Frears unfolds the story of Sammy the hedonistic, thoroughly English, son of a prominent Pakistani politician, who abandoned the young man and his mother in London years before to seek wealth and power in his homeland. Sammy, who scrapes out a living as an accountant, lives in a dangerous and decaying black neighbourhood with his wife Rosie, a sexually adventurous &#8220;modern woman&#8221; supportive of fashionable radical issues. Theirs is an open marriage based on, as Rosie puts it, &#8220;freedom plus commitment&#8221;. Change enters their lives with the arrival of Rafi, Sammy&#8217;s long lost father who has been forced to flee his political enemies in Pakistan. Struggling to maintain his self-dignity and his sanity in the terrifying environment of the city he no longer knows, Rafi rapidly becomes disenchanted by Sammy and Rosie&#8217;s unanchored world and tolerance of sexual liberty, drugs and revolutionary violence. As the demons of his past return to haunt Rafi, escape is impossible; personal tragedy is inevitable.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2261561, "name": "Stephen Frears", "creator_id": 71762, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55258", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2261560, "name": "Sarah Radclyffe", "creator_id": 61892, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2224483", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2261559, "name": "Tim Bevan", "creator_id": 72783, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1473065", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2261556, "name": "Sammy and Rosie Ltd", "creator_id": 25292, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222694", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2261552, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39060", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [22636]}, {"id": 83145, "acmi_id": "304342", "title": "Zorba the Greek", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "zorba-the-greek", "creator_credit": "Michael Cacoyannis and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1964", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52428, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q818710"}], "brief_description": "<p>After inheriting a mine in Crete, a young English writer (Alan Bates) goes to the Mediterranean island to inspect his property.

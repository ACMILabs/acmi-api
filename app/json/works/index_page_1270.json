Even as Manhattan was on the verge of the Depression, the skyscraper reigned supreme. &#8220;New York&#8217;s shifting, rising skyline was like nothing Europe had ever seen&#8221;, notes Hughes, as he outlines Art Deco and describes the construction of the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. FDR&#8217;s New Deal employed artists through the WPA (Works Progress Administration), which itself was the center of controversy when Diego Rivera had his left-wing fresco painted over by capitalist tycoon John D. Rockefeller. Major projects such as the Hoover Dam, representing &#8220;a rallying symbol for American self-confidence, so bruised and battered by the Great Depression,&#8221; were constructed. Urban artists such as Jacob Lawrence, Edward Hopper and Stuart Davis are featured. In the American Midwest, artists evoked a more conservative perspective, depicting idyllic scenes of rural and farm life. Highly innovative design was used to sell consumers a modern lifestyle. This movement culminated with the exhibition dedicated to the modern machine, the New York World&#8217;s Fair of 1939, which is remembered today as the last burst of utopian belief in the machine before the destruction left by the military technology of World War II.

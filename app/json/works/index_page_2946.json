Flashing forward 20 years on and a new group of counselors have ascended onto the camp, affectionately dubbed by the wary locals as &#8216;Camp blood&#8217;. Soon enough the body count begins to pile up as the horny teens get dispatched in various gruesome scenarios, all the while ignoring the blatent signs that this is not a good place to be.

Isabell Coe of the Wiradjuri Nation in Central New South Wales, journeyed to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra just prior to the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games to collect ashes from the Sacred Fire in order to establish another Tent Embassy with these &#8220;healing&#8221; ashes in Victoria Park, Sydney. This is the story of Isabell&#8217;s peace campaign and the Tent Embassy in Sydney, the frustrations, negotiations, mediations and finally reconciliation with the South Sydney Council and the New South Wales Police. Through Isabell and other Aboriginal Australians including Kevin Buzzcott (Arabunna Nation Elder) and Chicka Dixon (Yuin Nation Elder) along with many of the Embassy supporters, an insight is given to the history of Aboriginal land rights, the birth of the Tent Embassy and the symbolic role which the Tent Embassy plays in promoting understanding between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.

Ms Mei struggled between love and traditional values for women when a local school teacher fell in love with her. Ms Mei eventually did not take the step for love and firmly opposed to her daughter&#8217;s divorce when the young couple&#8217;s relation had problem. Annie&#8217;s parents were on way to China to see Annie, and the fact that Annie&#8217;s father had the same name as Ms Mei&#8217;s ex husband disturbed Mei a lot. It turned out that Ms Mei&#8217;s ex husband died on boat on his voyage to the US, and he gave his valuable passport (not everybody had one) to Anne&#8217;s father, who was the few survived and had used Ms Mei&#8217;s husband&#8217;s name after arriving in the US. Annie and her parents went back to the America and Ms Mei decided to start a new life.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nNanhai Film Corporation is a film company based in Beijing. It produces both films and TV series.<br />\nChina adopted the  &#8220;open-door&#8221; policy in the late 1970s, and since then, overseas Chinese were able to (re)-visit China, where they sometimes experienced a  &#8220;cultural shock&#8221;. Guangdong and Fujian (aka. Canton and Hokian) are the two provinces which had the largest number of emigrants living overseas.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nThis film adopts a westerner&#8217;s perspective to examine the changes taking place both in Chinese people&#8217;s mind and society in the early 1980s. It deals with the conflicts of traditional and new values from a foreigner&#8217;s point of view, which is not uncommon in Chinese cinema.</p>\n<p>(3 stars - Yuxing Zhou; May 21, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social change", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children of immigrants", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Life change events", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Change (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Life change events", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 835857, "name": "Nanhai Film Company", "creator_id": 32046, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 835858, "name": "Liu Guanxiong", "creator_id": 82637, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 835859, "name": "Kuang Jianren", "creator_id": 82638, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835860, "name": "Liu Yuefei", "creator_id": 82639, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835861, "name": "Xiao Pei", "creator_id": 82640, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835862, "name": "Wu Haiyan", "creator_id": 82641, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835863, "name": "Gan Zelan", "creator_id": 82642, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146445", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Release", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [55292], "external_references": []}, {"id": 79413, "acmi_id": "300362", "title": "The Visitor", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-visitor", "creator_credit": "Buz Alexander", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The Visitor is a dramatisation of Ray Bradbury&#8217;s science fiction short story. &#8220;Blood Rust&#8221; victims are exiled to the barren deserts of a quarantine planet to prevent spread of disease on Earth.

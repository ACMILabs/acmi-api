Awards: Prix Louis Delluc 1982 ; French Academy of Cinema 1983 (Cesar): best director for Andrzej Wajda ; British Academy Awards 1983: best foreign film. The film&#8217;s power derives from a series of contrasts between Danton and Robespierre on the level of characterisation and staging as much as ideology. The conflict is most evident when the two men confront each other&#8217;s claustrophobic and enclosed spaces, particularly during the aborted supper in Danton&#8217;s private apartment. In such scenes the theatricality of the dialogue, rendered all the more artificial by the dubbing of Pszoniak, is at odds with Depardieu&#8217;s more relaxed and gestural performance, which recalls the more enigmatic power of the silent cinema. The political conflict between the two is underlined not just by the contrast in styles of performance, but also by Wajda&#8217;s mise en scene, so that Danton&#8217;s clothes and rooms are red, Robespierre&#8217;s blue.

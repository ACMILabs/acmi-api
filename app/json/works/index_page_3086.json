A man who once had left wing political leanings, Hoefgen is forced to renounce his personal politics and even betray former colleagues in order to gain favour with the Nazis and advance his career. &#8220;Mephisto&#8221; is a compelling portrait of an artist whose ambition is in conflict with his integrity. The mood and aesthetics of 1930s Berlin are aptly evoked in this award winning drama (Oscar for Best Foreign Film, 1982). Directed by Istran Durnoik (Sunshine, Meeting Venus) and also starring Krystyna Janda and Ildiko Bansagi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hungary", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National socialism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History - 1933-1945", "Literature&nbsp;→ German literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Places&nbsp;→ Hungary"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mephisto", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995753, "name": "Istvan Szabo", "creator_id": 23077, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995752, "name": "Manfred Durniok", "creator_id": 17106, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q99907", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995751, "name": "Ma Film", "creator_id": 23076, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49696", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31757]}, {"id": 92201, "acmi_id": "315422", "title": "Bitter moon = Lunes de fiel", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bitter-moon-lunes-de-fiel", "creator_credit": "Roman Polanski, Canal+, Les Films Alain Sarde, R P Productions and Timothy Burrill Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52379, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q878964"}], "brief_description": "<p>This dark-humored comedy drama explores perverse sexual obsession in a marriage based on mutual hatred.

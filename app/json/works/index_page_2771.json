Korine serves up an uncomfortable portrait of family life for Julien: a dictatorial father who is prone to wearing a gas mask (played with glee by director Werner Herzog), his sister, Pearl (Chloe Sevigny), who is pregnant with Julien&#8217;s baby and a young wrestling obsessed brother (Evan Neumann) whose father pays him to dress up in his dead mother&#8217;s clothes. The films loose style and roving camera makes it feel uncomfortably documentary like at times, while the films grainy, &#8216;no-frills&#8217; look produces some surprisingly haunting and beautiful images. Cast also includes Joyce Korine and Chrissy Kobylak.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Schizophrenia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960415, "name": "Independent Pictures", "creator_id": 71714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960416, "name": "Scott Macaulay", "creator_id": 6916, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960417, "name": "Robin O'hara", "creator_id": 79659, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960418, "name": "Cary Woods", "creator_id": 72696, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2940710", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960419, "name": "Harmony Korine", "creator_id": 71720, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49792", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [31837], "external_references": [{"id": 2744, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3109438"}]}, {"id": 75212, "acmi_id": "012526", "title": "Julie, your best just isn't good enough", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "julie-your-best-just-isnt-good-enough", "creator_credit": "Film Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Julie left school early and as been in and out of jobs for four years.

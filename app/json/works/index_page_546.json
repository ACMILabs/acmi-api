All these scenes are shot from an aerial perspective. 00:15:58:00 another ‘iris out’ effect closes the sequence.</p>\n<p>00:16:35:0 back in daytime, a sign above a shop is advertising &#8216;Sennitt’s Ice Cream&#8217; (this brand, started in 1904 and discontinued in 1961 may have produced Australia’s first commercial ice-cream). Crowds again line the street as the Queen’s car moves along it. 00:16:56:00 we see another good clear view of the Queen in the back of her open car.</p>\n<p>00:17:39:00 a further daytime aerial sequence of the Queen’s motorcade and mounted police (the camerawork here is quite ‘jerky’ and rather blurred). 00:18:34:00 Government House is seen in the middle distance. 00:18:40:00 the front façade of the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, is photographed in bright sunshine, with the Josef Hochgurtel fountain in front of it. Footage of the gardens surrounding the Exhibition Building follows.</p>\n<p>00:19:13:00 Green trams are photographed moving along Swanston Street in Melbourne’s CBD, before further footage of the city’s decorations. 00:19:39:00 the reel ends with a final (rather jerkily-shot) scene of the Queen’s car – preceded by policemen on motorcycles – moving along a city street as a group of onlookers wave.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:56:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Urban transportation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "History&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "History&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "People&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "People&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "Places&nbsp;→ Flinders Street Railway Station (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, Vic.", "Places&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2380002, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

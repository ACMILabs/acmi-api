The men are putting on a concert - their act is a comical one which involves dressing up as Japanese soldiers, but backfires when one of the lower ranked Japanese soldiers is offended. When Curley is caught stealing a tin of condensed milk, it&#8217;s the same young Japanese soldier who decides to humiliate him by throwing him into the <code>Hole&amp;#8217; for six weeks where he experiences the constant harsh acts of the soldier.</code>Eddie&#8217;s Birthday&#8217;: Memories come flooding back to Eddie while he is shaving one day, a ritual he used to only perform on his birthday in Changi. His memories are of the year he got an infected wisdom tooth and unwillingly attracted the attention of the cruel and malicious Captain Shindo, whom the men think is starting to go mad. `Pacifying The Angels&#8217;: It&#8217;s finally the day of the reunion and Tom loves seeing his old mates. He hates where his memory goes after spending time with them, the last night of the war. The war is officially over and the Japanese declare they have won, burning all evidence of what they have done to the men in the last 5 years. &#8216;The Secret Nine&#8217; have to pull all their courage and strength together as they witness the Japanese shooting anyone they can; it will take all their might to survive the night.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Malaysia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Singapore", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war - Australia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Asia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Australia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Japan", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Violent crimes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mateship", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Blindness", "Places&nbsp;→ Malaysia", "Places&nbsp;→ Singapore", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1804841, "name": "Bill Hughes", "creator_id": 22134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812582, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812584, "name": "Kate Woods", "creator_id": 63244, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 812581, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50226", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32219], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92730, "acmi_id": "316048", "title": "Changi.

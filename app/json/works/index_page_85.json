null, "brief_description": "<p>The Gadsden Company has a long and proud history of manufacture, dating back to its foundation by Jabez Gadsden in 1879. The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film is a wonderful composite of several different sequences in different periods of time, including the 1934 floods in Melbourne, tennis and gardens in the 1930s, beach scenes in the 1950s and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 very dramatic flooding around Melbourne, which is likely to be 1934 when major flooding from torrential rains affected large areas of the city.<br />\n00:00:02:00 people looking out over a flooded road and possibly submerged bridge toward urban buildings on the the hillsides on the other side of the floodwaters. We may assume a trip to town has been stopped by the floods as the group are dressed for an outing. This could be Yarra river at some point.<br />\n00:00:55:00 several cars (1930s and 1940s models) in a city street with tram tracks, stuck at a flooded dip in the road; the scene includes a brief look at a motor bike. This could be Bourke Road, Camberwell as the area was flooded during the 1934 floods, the road is hilly and has tram tracks.<br />\n00:00:57:00 more flooded streets and a sign for &#8216;Glendebourne Ave&#8217; which places the footage in Toorak.<br />\n00:01:33:00 a tremendously flooded Yarra River in the Melbourne CBD with onlookers observing the rushing waters lapping up over the bank, and a view toward Princes Bridge. Includes a man casually walking along completely indifferent to the flood.<br />\n00:02:05:00 we again see the fast running flooded river which could be around Yarra Bend Park as there are canoes on the bank, a traditional boating spot.<br />\n00:02:31:00 footage changes abruptly to colour and a 1950s beach scene with four people wandering along the sand; the two mean are dressed for swimming, the two women more formally. They sit and chat on the sand while the women have a cigarette.<br />\n00:02:55:00 surfing in the waves on a beach; some of the the surfboards appear to be the early wooden type of board.<br />\n00:03:15:00 two women in a garden and then footage of one of them very happy to be trying out a bicycle.<br />\n00:04:28:00 black and white scenes of a garden including some children at a table and chairs setting taken with the camera overhead from a top floor.<br />\n00:05:05:00 scenes of a river, probably the Yarra near one of the family homes in Kew or Hawthorn. We see children and then a woman swinging out on a knotted rope swing; the style of dresser and swimming costumes indicate the 1930s or 1940s.<br />\n00:05:52:00 outside views of a house, possibly a Gadsden home.

The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film features the Gadsden family life in the 1950s both at home and on outings to a sports club and to the beach.

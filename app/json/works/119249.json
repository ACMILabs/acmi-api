I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there.

Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line.

The Monty Python crew each play numerous roles within the film, creating an anarchic madcap spoof of Biblical films and religious epics. With several musical interludes, including &#8220;Always look on the bright side of life&#8221; (sung at the crucifixion) the writers slay many sacred cows in the name of comedy.

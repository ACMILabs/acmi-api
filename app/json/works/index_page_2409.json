Through one such project, a documentary about teenagers, she meets and befriends three of her subjects, Jimmy (Joaquin Phoenix), Lydia (Alison Folland) and Russell (Casey Affleck), three awkward teens with very low self esteem. Jimmy and Lydia take a particular liking to the glamorous and confident Suzanne who seizes on their crush as a way to manipulate them into helping her achieve her own murderous goals.

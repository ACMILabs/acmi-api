Episode 3. &#8216;Open oceans&#8217; explores regions located miles away from land, home to the swiftest and most powerful ocean hunters. Creatures in these areas use sonar tracking, water vibrations and exploiting a highly developed sense of smell to detect food in remote areas away from their spawning grounds. Volcanic activity in the ocean creates new land masses and alter the ecology as currents deliver plankton which attracts fish to the new island.

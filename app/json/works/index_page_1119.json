In this documentary Peter takes the viewer on a potted history of Old Roses, from Species through to the Teas. He looks at their place in history and their evolution. The process of hybridizing is explained by Peter&#8217;s daughter, Amanda Gipp, and we watch the Beales family at the Sandringham and Royal Norfolk Shows. An eleven minute pictorial index of the roses discussed throughout the video is presented following the credits.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Horticulture", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Flower gardening", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardening", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Horticulture", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Roses", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427545, "name": "Vivian Russell", "creator_id": 29044, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427544, "name": "Michelle Fox", "creator_id": 29043, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427543, "name": "Vivian Russell Incorporated", "creator_id": 29042, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427542, "name": "Viburnum Gardens", "creator_id": 76390, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43515", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [26586]}, {"id": 87094, "acmi_id": "309006", "title": "Great gardens of the American west", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "great-gardens-of-the-american-west", "creator_credit": "Tier One Communications", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>There are some wonderful public and private gardens dotting North America&#8217;s West Coast and gardening enthusiast Grahame Beakhurst visits some of them, including; a Japanese Tea Garden, Golden Gate Park, San Fransisco Bellevue Botanical Garden, Washington Thompson&#8217;s California Heather Garden, Bank of America Roof Garden, San Fransisco Filoli Gardens, Woodside, California, Peter Symcox&#8217;s Garden, British Columbia American Ranch Style Garden renovation, Washington Harland Hand&#8217;s Garden and El Cerrito, California.

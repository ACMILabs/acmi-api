Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows life in Ballarat and regional Victoria in the 1950s, including kids’ birthdays, picnics in the park and holidays at the beach. The film is mainly in colour and the last few minutes are in black and white.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 cute baby playing a toy piano<br />\n00:01:40:00 a kid’s birthday party<br />\n00:03:22:00 kids playing in a band, including banjo, piano accordion, and guitar<br />\n00:04:00:00 playing footy in the front yard of a suburban house<br />\n00:05:36:00 title card ‘Wayne 1 Year’ superimposed over a baby with a cake<br />\n00:06:40:00 baby in a bath tub in the garden<br />\n00:08:22:00 picnic at a park with some excellent shots of a 1950s car<br />\n00:10:13:00 the family going on ‘Pad-o-lo’ paddle catamarans<br />\n00:12:13:00 Marie and friend eating in the car at a park picnic<br />\n00:14:15:00 two men in bathers in a sand bag competition<br />\n00:16:04:00 nice shot of Marie on the beach in a lovely printed dress and colourful towel over her head<br />\n00:16:35:00 John in a suit on a motorbike<br />\n00:21:05:00 local boys playing a game of rugby<br />\n00:21:28:00 film changes to black and white for a picnic in the park</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:24:07:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387515, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.

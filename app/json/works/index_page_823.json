They become involved in an indeterminate cross-country race with the middle-aged driver of a new Pontiac GTO. Like other Hellman films, Two-lane Blacktop is a genre film in which the popular elements are not exploited to satisfy audience expectations but are subverted into fresh patterns. This makes it the most determinedly original of the post-Easy Rider road movies, an existential parable which makes striking use of widescreen compositions, long takes and elliptical cuts while denying narrative tension. Instead there is the resonance of character and situation. Hellman has described the film as &#8216;a love story (about) &#8230; how much romance is left in a non-romantic world&#8217;, but this is implicit. Cast includes: James Taylor, Warren Oates, Laurie Bird, Dennis Wilson.

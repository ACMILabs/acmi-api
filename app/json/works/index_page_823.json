The street could be Cleeve Court in Toorak.</p>\n<p>We see a young girl playing on a swing surrounded by a beautiful garden in full bloom.</p>\n<p>The film finishes with a trip to the country for horse riding lessons. We see the horses being saddled up while they stand under a Hills Hoist clothes line, and the children are taken through their rising trot and cantering paces. The horse riding instructors use wooden sign posts and mallets to mark out a course for the young horse riders.</p>\n<p>This film shows great examples of fashion, including swimwear, children’s recreational activities including horse riding and swimming, play equipment, toys and architecture typical of the era.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights list:<br />\n00:00:56:00 Children playing with long pieces of cane with mid-century modern house in background<br />\n00:03:36:00 Small boy and a butterfly on a garden path<br />\n00:05:29:00 Brother and sister sit by the swimming pool eating biscuits<br />\n00:07:43:00 Mother goes for a swim – good example of swimwear<br />\n00:08:35:00 Three children play in a wading pool<br />\n00:09:56:00 Children swim laps in an outdoor pool, perhaps at St Catherine’s School, Toorak<br />\n00:10:26:00 Children dive into an outdoor pool as above<br />\n00:10:37:00 Boy on tricycle riding down a street lined with grand houses, perhaps Cleeve Court, Toorak<br />\n00:11:25:00 Children play in wading pool with kickboards and improvised boat</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:17:14:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Gardens - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Playgrounds", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming for children", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Swimming pools", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1898966, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178647", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964-1966", "notes": "", "to_year": "1964-1966"}], "labels": [59216], "external_references": []}]}

Oscar Wilde died in Paris on 30 November 1900 but his wit, his brilliance as a dramatist (Lady Windermere&#8217;s fan, An Ideal husband, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Importance of being Ernest), his love for the aesthetics of life, and his total disregard for conformity will live on forever. In fact, some of Wilde&#8217;s famous quotes are still used today and he has been satirised and characterised by many over the century including Gilbert and Sullivan&#8217;s comic opera &#8220;Patience&#8221; and the periodical Punch. Features archival footage, stills, sites and locations frequented throughout his life including the house he was born in and readings and quotations from his personal letters and writings. Narrated by Denys Hawthorne and voice of Oscar Wilde by Alan Stanford.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Literature - Study and teaching", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors - Biography", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors, Irish", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - History and criticism", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature - Study and teaching", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets, Irish", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dramatists", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900", "People&nbsp;→ Authors - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Wilde, Oscar, 1854-1900", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Ireland"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 820513, "name": "RTE International", "creator_id": 36643, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 820514, "name": "Sean O'Mordha", "creator_id": 80892, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 820512, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52547", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 27, "name": "Ireland", "slug": "ireland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [34080], "external_references": []}]}

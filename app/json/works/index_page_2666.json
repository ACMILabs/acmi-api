After being sent to jail for armed robbery aged seventeen, Allan&#8217;s family disowned him. Almost thirty years later, his father is dead and Allan, now reformed and a published poet and community centre volunteer, is seeking to rebuild his relationships with his mother and sister. He travels back to country Victoria, to the town of his youth, wondering which family he really belongs to - his substitute family of crims and street people who understand him or the biological family to whom he is a stranger. His journey of reconciliation is punctuated with his poems and the train trip from Melbourne to Shepparton is interwoven with reminiscences of past events.

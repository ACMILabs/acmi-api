Born in a remote area, the new Dalai Lama (seen at ages two and five in early sequences) is observed by monks who determine that he is the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion. In 1944 he uses newsreels and Western magazines to study WWII events, and as the war ends, he is forced to deal with Chinese Communist aggression. Mao&#8217;s military stranglehold on Tibet eventually forces the Dalai Lama to flee to Dharmsala, India. Commenting on the anti-spiritual&#8230;Marxist government of the Chinese Communists, Scorsese remarked, &#8220;What interests me is how a man of non-violence deals with these people &#8212; that&#8217;s ultimately the story.&#8221; With a $28 million budget, he re-created Tibet&#8217;s tragedy by filming in south-central Morocco with a cast of nonprofessional Tibetan actors. Second unit work took place at locations in Idaho and British Columbia. Cast includes Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Gyurme Ththong, Tencho Gyalpo, Tsewang Migyur Khangsar and Sonam Phunstok.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhist monasteries - Tibet", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhist monks", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Buddhists - Persecutions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Lamaism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Buddhists - Persecutions", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Dalai Lama XIV, 1935-", "Places&nbsp;→ Tibet (China)", "Religious films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958635, "name": "Touchstone Pictures", "creator_id": 70084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958636, "name": "Cappa Productions", "creator_id": 45394, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958637, "name": "Refuge Productions", "creator_id": 79233, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958638, "name": "Barbara de Fina", "creator_id": 23666, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958639, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "creator_id": 3485, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q41148", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47029", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [29341], "external_references": [{"id": 638, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q944291"}]}, {"id": 115718, "acmi_id": "F000069", "title": "Kumonosu-Jo = Throne of blood", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kumonosu-jo-throne-of-blood", "creator_credit": "Toho Kabushiki Kaisha and Akira Kurosawa", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Although the spoken word is sparingly used in this reworking of Macbeth, the structure of the play is closely adhered to by retaining the division of acts.

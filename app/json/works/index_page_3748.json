When his benefactor dies he is let loose on a world of which he cannot make sense, and which he cannot change with the remote control. An accident brings him into contact with Washington diplomats and business people and the inanities Chauncey learned from television sound like profundities to them. Soon he has met the U.S. President and Chauncey is on his way to ruling the world. This little gem of a movie, with its savage black comedy and cynical perspective on U.S. politics was released on the eve of Reagan&#8217;s election to President.

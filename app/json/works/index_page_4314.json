Mark&#8217;s big dream, however, is to be an American filmmaker.

The gap between Mark&#8217;s suburban reality and his dream is all too obvious, and the filmmakers milk a lot of laughs from his &#8216;loser&#8217; existence: his drugged out friend, Mike; his relationship with Uncle Bill, a senile old man from whom he derives financing; his home life; his eccentric personality; the &#8216;nobodies&#8217; who help him on his film and so on.

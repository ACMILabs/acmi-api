The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film shows the Gadsden family enjoying a skiing holiday at Perisher Valley, in the Snowy Mountains, New South Wales, during the 1960s. We know that it is Perisher, as the first scenes are of the &#8216;Sundeck&#8217; sign on the side of the Sundeck Hotel which would have been very new at the time, and is a feature of the film.</p>\n<p>The Sundeck was famed for being the first hotel built in Perisher and the highest (so that the camera is able to get some spectacular views) and it was rebuilt a year after being opened in 1960 following a fire. This film shows family members at the Sundeck sitting on the balcony, lining up and taking off at the adjoining ski lift as well as skiing down the slopes.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 &#8216;Sundeck&#8217; sign appears followed by views of falling snow through the window of the Hotel<br />\n00:00:45:00 we see the ski lift and family members or friends hopping on board<br />\n00:01:29:00 a large wooden toboggan being ridden across a slope by a family comes into view<br />\n00:01:40:00 shots of the Sundeck balcony looking out over the slopes and the ski lift<br />\n00:02:00:00 closer shot of the Hotel ski lift<br />\n00:02:10:00 the camera takes shots travelling along on the ski lift<br />\n00:02:38:00 close up of landing at the other end of the ski lift<br />\n00:02:30:00 scenes of the skiers on the slopes, particularly family members<br />\n00:05:15:00 Ronald is filming his own skis as he moves down the slope<br />\n00:05:30:00 Ronald takes a lovely shot of his wife Jess Gadsden skiing along a slope against a very blue sky<br />\n00:05:40:00 another great up close shot of the workings of the ski lift as part of the new Hotel<br />\n00:06:16:00 skiing competition starts for both children and adults<br />\n00:08:10:00 we can see the Hotel&#8217;s &#8216;new T Bar lift&#8217; (a ground level simle design ski lift rather than a full chair overhead lift) being shown to us by some of the younger Gadsdens<br />\n00:08:24:00 the family can be seen on the Hotel balcony enjoying a beer<br />\n00:11:39:00 lots of children and young people take to the slopes<br />\n00:12:46:00 footage taken from the ski lift returning to the Sundeck Hotel</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Gadsden Family Home Movie Collection: Reel 165]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ronald Gadsden and Stanley Gadsden</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1961</p>", "description": "<p>The Gadsden Company has a long and proud history of manufacture, dating back to its foundation by Jabez Gadsden in 1879.

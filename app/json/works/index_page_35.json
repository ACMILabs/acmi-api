It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to what was then Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and briefly visits South Africa. He films visits to the tourist spots of Victoria Falls and the Matobos National Park which may be where he captures some wonderful wandering wildlife, keeping abreast with them from a moving vehicle. Billy also captures the landscapes wherever he goes, including some public gardens, national parklands, cultivated land, hilly rocky and dry land and some lovely waterways.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using Standard 8mm film.

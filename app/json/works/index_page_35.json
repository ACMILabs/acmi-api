Billingham has now made &#8216;Fishtank&#8217;, a commission for television by Artangel in collaboration with film-maker Adam Curtis and Illuminations TV for BBC2&#8217;s acclaimed TV series. The &#8216;video verite&#8217; of Fishtank is contained within the compressed space/fishtank of the flat. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they argue. Billingham&#8217;s film registers the emotional temperature of this space and the family who live there with a closeness that transcends camera conventions. Like the paintings of Lucian Freud, Billingham crafts a terrible beauty from the landscape of family life and its patterns of pathos, despair and hope.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:43:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["MA", "Mediatheque -

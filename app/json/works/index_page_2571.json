This cooly argued and well-researched documentary argues that the invasion of Panama was a cold-blooded exercise, initiated by President George Bush, in which the United States destroyed a country&#8217;s infrastructure, and killed over 3,000 people, in order to ensure their dominance in Central American politics and to ensure control of the Panama Canal well into the 21st Century. &#8220;The Panama Deception&#8221; investigates the links between the United States military, international drug-trafficking and illegal arms dealings.

Goretta has described his film as &#8216;a genre painting&#8217; in narrative form and it is constructed in a series of brief fragmentary scenes which form a picture without evident narrative connections. With its narrative ellipses - eloquent silences and observation of Pomme&#8217;s mysterious inner life - Goretta&#8217;s film resembles Bresson&#8217;s &#8216;Une Femme Douce&#8217;.

It explores the loving relationship between Stevie (Glenda Jackson) and her Aunt (Mona Washbourne), the romantic liaisons in Stevie&#8217;s life, and the eventual fame that her poetic writings bring, using flashbacks and direct dialogue with the audience by Stevie and &#8220;The Man&#8221; (Trevor Howard). This is very much a stage play on film with not a lot of cinematic expression or extravagant landscapes, confined most of the time to the living room scenes of the house where Stevie and her Aunt dwell. However, it is the literary merit and the art of language which perhaps give this film its appeal, not to mention the excellent performances by some of Britain&#8217;s most highly acclaimed actors.

The series was produced by The Pygos Group and Trickfilmstudio for Swiss television, and centers on a family of anthropomorphic penguins living at the South Pole. The main character is the family&#8217;s son and title character, Pingu. The show was made by HiT Entertainment and HoT Animation, British companies, from seasons 5–6.</p>\n<p>The show originally ran for fourteen seasons from 28 May 1986 to 9 April 2000 on SF DRS. In 2001, there were 2 Pingu episodes made that did not air during the original run. The episodes were run later, in 2000, as part of a Pingu marathon. HiT Entertainment&#8217;s request for more episodes convinced Pygos to bring back the show in 1998, with two more series. Of note, season 1 and season 2 were run consecutively but took 4 years for each season to complete, while season 3 and season 4 took 2 and 3 years to complete – the show was not cancelled in between.

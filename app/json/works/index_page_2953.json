Z&#8217;s transformation from faceless nobody to unwilling hero eventuates when he volunteers to swap places with his fearless soldier ant buddy Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), in order to get close to the feisty Princess Bala (Sharon Stone). This lands the nervous insect right in the middle of the brutal termite wars and a series of misadventures, accumulating in the search for the mythical &#8220;Insectopia&#8221;. Directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson have a lot of fun by visually suggesting a microscopic world not unlike New York city and by giving the animated ants the physical traits and mannerisms of their voice-over counterparts. Gene Hackman, Dan Aykroyd, Jennifer Lopez, Danny Glover, Christopher Walken and Ann Bancroft are among the many who contribute their voices.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Ants", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Insects", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fourmiz", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2098290, "name": "Eric Darnell", "creator_id": 78540, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2630467", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098292, "name": "Tim Johnson", "creator_id": 77479, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3991363", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098287, "name": "Aron Warner", "creator_id": 55445, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098286, "name": "Brad Lewis", "creator_id": 78538, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q681740", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098288, "name": "Patty Wooton", "creator_id": 78539, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337239", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098280, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2098283, "name": "PDI Group", "creator_id": 29455, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034332", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2098278, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51944", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33584]}]}

Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program&#8217;s style makes the avante garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode MacKenzie visits the City of Kingston community arts project in Parkdale, &#8216;Artbites&#8217;. A project where food meets art. James Lynch is interviewed at Uplands Gallery following his recent residency in L.A. and explores themes of the spectacle of images and the relationship with fictitious fantasies. Part 2 of the program features the work of two video artists Dominic Redfern and Daniel Von Sturmer. Introduced by Mackenzie (who provides an entertaining &#8216;history of video conventions&#8217; in less than 1 minute) are excerpts from Redfern&#8217;s &#8216;Non/un&#8217; and &#8216;There&#8217;s this guy&#8230;&#8217; that are concerned with exploring the use of screen surface and space and movement, time and space. Von Sturmer&#8217;s work reconstructs the &#8220;white cube&#8221; to sit within the video frame where he places ordinary objects in order to explore their physical properties, whilst exporting experimental studio processes into video work. The outcome is a surprising observation of the malleability of space and time within the video frame.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Themes, motives", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art appreciation", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art criticism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art galleries", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, European", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists and community", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Community art projects", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Conceptual art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Modernism (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1119595, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1119594, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115599, "acmi_id": "S01440", "title": "Public hangings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "public-hangings", "creator_credit": "Andrew MacKenzie", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93887, "acmi_id": "317641", "title": "Public hangings.

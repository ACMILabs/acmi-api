The film is a fascinating &#8216;slice-of-life&#8217; view of working class life in Britain of the 60s, whose entrancing black and white cinematography, reminiscent of Bill Brandt&#8217;s photography of working class England, contrasts with the gauche and drab reality of the characters&#8217; surrounds. This controversial film dealt with many taboo topics on the day - teen pregnancy, inter-racial romance, homosexuality, child abandonment, without excessive sermonising on the topics, typical of American moral dramas of the 1950s. Cast includes Dora Bryan, Rita Tushingham, Robert Stephens, Murray Melvin, Paul Danquah and David Boliver.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Unwanted", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-taste-of-honey", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998918, "name": "Tony Richardson", "creator_id": 62037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998917, "name": "Woodfall Film Productions", "creator_id": 61992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998916, "name": "Continental", "creator_id": 26186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998915, "name": "Bryanston Films", "creator_id": 23052, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52030", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [33664], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94157, "acmi_id": "317939", "title": "Movie crazy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "movie-crazy", "creator_credit": "Clyde Bruckman, Harold Lloyd and Harold Lloyd Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1932", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1932-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Lloyd&#8217;s alter ego is developed further in this film about a starstruck movie lover who, through a misunderstanding, lands the promise of a screen test.

To combat its reputation of being cheap entertainment for the lower classes, film sought to emulate the highbrow success of the theatre by replicating its lavish venues, poaching its stars for screen roles, and adapting plays into films. Working within the limitations of early film cameras and the staginess of Shakespeare&#8217;s works, many of the early productions were hybrids between stage and screen, juxtaposing constructed sets and stage-like tableaux with location shooting, trick photography, hand stencilling, and colour tinting. Works included are King John (Great Britain, 1899), the first ever film adaptation of Shakespeare; The Tempest (Great Britain, 1908); A Midsummer night&#8217;s dream (USA, 1909); King Lear (Italy, 1910); Twelfth night (USA, 1910); The Merchant of Venice (Italy, 1910), and Richard III (Great Britain, 1911).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Archival resources", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater - Production and direction"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52021", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33655], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94121, "acmi_id": "317898", "title": "Mortal thoughts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mortal-thoughts-dvd", "creator_credit": "Alan Rudolph, Mark Tarlov, John Fiedler, Joseph Caracciolo Jr, Rufglen Films, Polar Film and New Visions Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Cynthia and Joyce are childhood friends who get involved in the gruesome death of Joyce&#8217;s abusive husband in a moment of passion.

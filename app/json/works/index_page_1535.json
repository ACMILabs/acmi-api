The film follows the recruits as they are increasingly pushed to the edge of their physical and mental capabilities by a dehumanising military regime convinced that only by brutalising the men will they be able to sufficiently face the terrors of the war ahead. Starring Colin Farrell as Roland Bozz, a young man whose independent spirit and questioning mind puts him immediately at odds with authority, &#8220;Tigerland&#8221; is a punishing but compelling view of army life. The actual war is in the background. It is as a study of masculinity, repressed sexuality and violence that the film is most effective.

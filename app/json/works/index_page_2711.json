Scripted by novelist Marguerite Duras, &#8220;Hiroshima Mon Amour&#8221; heralded a new phase for international cinema, a precursor to the New Wave, and the development of a cinema that would explore contemporary questions of philosophy and politics. Though the &#8220;stories&#8221; which the film explores are powerfully involving, the formal structure of the film forces the viewer to confront his or her own personal construction of &#8220;memory&#8221; as mediated through film and history. The film shows the impossibility of &#8220;explaining&#8221; Hiroshima but also convincingly explores the need to permanently interrogate the conditions which led to Hiroshima.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Hiroshima (Japan) - Bombardment, 1945", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Hiroshima (Japan) - Bombardment, 1945", "Romance", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/hiroshima-mon-amour", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951417, "name": "Argos Films", "creator_id": 69972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951418, "name": "Como Films", "creator_id": 71650, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951419, "name": "Pathe Overseas", "creator_id": 77344, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951420, "name": "Daiei Motion Picture Company", "creator_id": 25324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951421, "name": "Sacha Kamenka", "creator_id": 77345, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951422, "name": "Shirakawa Takeo", "creator_id": 77346, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951423, "name": "Samy Halfron", "creator_id": 77347, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951424, "name": "Alain Resnais", "creator_id": 71944, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q218022", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951416, "name": "Visionary Communications", "creator_id": 77085, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39091", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1959", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1959"}], "labels": [22665], "external_references": [{"id": 115, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q283036"}, {"id": 4408, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "5544"}]}, {"id": 88405, "acmi_id": "310969", "title": "Hiroshima & Nagasaki: the harvest of nuclear war", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hiroshima-nagasaki-the-harvest-of-nuclear-war", "creator_credit": "Iwanami Productions, Naoyuki Jinnouchi and Masami Hayakawa", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1982", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Outlines the horrific effects of the two atomic bombs dropped on the small cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.

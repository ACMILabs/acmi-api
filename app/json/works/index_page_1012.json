landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good.

The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, Wallace and companions tour &#8216;Ayers Rock&#8217; (Uluru) as it was then named, and  &#8216;The Olgas&#8217; (Kata Tjuta), and he provides some context for both sites, Indigenous names and the connection to local Indigenous Australians.</p>\n<p>In acknowledging the importance of Uluru to Indigenous Australians Wallace provides a respectful and admiring narrative. However, information and context of the 1960s is unlikely to be as accurate or as sensitive as a narrative prepared with or by current traditional owners. (In 1985 the Australian Government returned Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park to the traditional owners of the area – the Anangu).</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film, with a sound track and voiceover narrative.</p>\n<p>00:00:02:00 title card &#8216;Land of the Pitjandjara&#8217; (Pitjantjatjara)<br />\n00:00:42:00 we see Mount Conner, as stated by the voiceover<br />\n00:01:10:00 a large pelican in the sandy landscape and voiceover explaining &#8216;Curtin Springs is one of the great cattle stations of the (red) centre&#8217;, and travellers stand around a well packed &#8216;Land Rover&#8217; off-road motor car<br />\n00:01:30:00 filming from the car along a muddy track<br />\n00:01:40:00 travellers from buses gather wood for campfires as the narrator explains their destination is &#8216;Ayers Rock (Uluru)&#8217;, followed by stacking dead mulga branches &#8216;atop the vehicles&#8217;<br />\n00:02:00:00 driving under stone entry gate and ironwork sign &#8216;Ayers Rock and Mount Olga&#8217;<br />\n00:02:19:00 approaching Uluru<br />\n00:02:38:00 a &#8216;Tjintir-tjintirpa&#8217; (willy wagtail) pecking at dry scrub grass while Wallace&#8217;s narration gives a brief description of the connection of local Indigenous Australians, the Indigenous name &#8216;Uluru&#8217; and context in which it sits, the &#8216;dreamtime&#8217; legends<br />\n00:03:28:00 views of the northern, or as Wallace points out, &#8216;the sunny side of the Rock&#8217;<br />\n00:04:00:00 views around the base of Uluru and Wallace continues his narrative<br />\n00:04:20:00 a long shallow cave<br />\n00:04:30:00 &#8216;The Olgas&#8217; (Kata Tjuta) on the horizon a short distance away from Uluru<br />\n00:04:43:00 close-up of &#8216;the Kangaroo Tail&#8217;, a long detached piece of rock stretching across Uluru<br />\n00:05:08:00 a &#8216;wet weather cave&#8217; that Wallace describes as &#8216;especially significant&#8217; that contains Indigenous rock art.

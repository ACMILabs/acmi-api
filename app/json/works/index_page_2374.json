The original screenplay (by director Kenneth Lonergan) veers away from cliche and pat conclusions, imbuing the characters with a realistic quality. Sammy and Terry are orphaned at a young age when their parents are killed in a car accident. As adults, the siblings are estranged, having made divergent choices. Sammy is a single parent with an eight-year-old son, Rudy, living in the house she was brought up in, working in a bank. She lives by a strict moral code, bound by religion and duty, but is entirely capable of hypocrisy and self-delusion. Terry, by contrast, is a wild loner, full of rage, self-destructive by nature but charming in his own humorous way. He doesn&#8217;t believe in Sammy&#8217;s ordered conservative life and inadvertently challenges this, creating chaos with his presence.

Kaufman ably captures the fetid environs of the asylum; the barely contained carnal desires of the inmates, their depravity and insanity, inflaming the nightmarish atmosphere of these scenes.

Meanwhile the doctor marries a virginal bride, brought up in a nunnery, who he mercilessly abuses. Philip Kaufman (The Unbearable lightness of being, Henry and June, The Right stuff) presents the Marquis de Sade as a mostly harmless presence (ignoring his historical squalidity) - compared to the enshrined corruption within the Church. Kaufman ably captures the fetid environs of the asylum; the barely contained carnal desires of the inmates, their depravity and insanity, inflaming the nightmarish atmosphere of these scenes. Rush puts in an impressive, if manic, performance as a tormented artist, whose prose may inspire acts of passion and murder witnessed throughout the film.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Paris, 1804 - following the bloody climate of the French Revolution erotic writer, the Marquis de Sade, resides in the Charenton Asylum for the insane where he continues to pen his sadomasochistic literature. When his latest tome upsets Napoleon, Dr Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is despatched to ensure that de Sade be published no more. In charge of the asylum is a benevolent priest Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) who allows de Sade&#8217;s writings as a form of therapy. Coulmier and Royer-Collard soon come into conflict about the treatment of the Marquis and the running of the asylum.

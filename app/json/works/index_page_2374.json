Lear makes a catastrophic decision, ousting the loyal and honest Cordelia, retaining his two remaining deceitful daughters who intend to dethrone him. &#8220;King Lear&#8221; is a tragedy that repeatedly portrays the restless intolerance of the young towards the old, the powerlessness of virtue in the face of deceit, and the fragility of the bonds which hold families and communities together. In this adaptation, made for television, director Richard Eyre sets the scene with admirable minimalism, allowing for language and gesture to be at the fore of the production, staged by the Royal National Theatre, to great acclaim. A majestic tragedy of misplaced trust and filial ingratitude.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Adaptations&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Insanity", "History&nbsp;→ England - History", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 817887, "name": "Richard Eyre", "creator_id": 26363, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q657354", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1820153, "name": "Sue Birtwistle", "creator_id": 22983, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q165360", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817884, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817885, "name": "Chestermead", "creator_id": 35900, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817883, "name": "British Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 11896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51843", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33492]}]}

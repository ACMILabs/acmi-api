In its moral complexity, insight and daring it leaves the products of the Hollywood motion picture industry for dead.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["13:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Emmy Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in television", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Depression, Mental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1121060, "name": "Matthew Penn", "creator_id": 80745, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121059, "name": "Andy Wolk", "creator_id": 80744, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121058, "name": "Tim Van Patten", "creator_id": 80743, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121057, "name": "Lorraine Senna", "creator_id": 80742, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121056, "name": "Alan Taylor", "creator_id": 80741, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121055, "name": "Allen Coulter", "creator_id": 80740, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121054, "name": "John Patterson", "creator_id": 75124, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121053, "name": "Nick Gomez", "creator_id": 80739, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121052, "name": "Daniel Attias", "creator_id": 80738, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121051, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121050, "name": "David Chase", "creator_id": 80737, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121049, "name": "Ilene Landress", "creator_id": 36246, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121048, "name": "Chase Films", "creator_id": 36245, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121047, "name": "Brillstein-Grey Entertainment", "creator_id": 36244, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121046, "name": "Home Box Office", "creator_id": 22860, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1121045, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

Broad appeal to white audiences came about in the 1968, culminating in an emotional 95% white audience in front of B.B. King at the Fillmore Auditorium - a new experience for B.B. and one that would mark a change in his audience for good. Ending with a live concert at the WC Handy Awards in 2002, this documentary is sure to inform and inspire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Radio - History", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "History&nbsp;→ Mississippi - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Nightclubs", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composition (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Concerts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Gospel music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Guitarists", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ King, B.

presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]&#8221;.<br />\nPart of Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;The Blues Collection&#8221;. Kidnapped by Uncle Buddy, on his way to be saved from the devil by being baptised, a young 11 year-old boy gets a life education on exactly what it is he is going to be &#8216;saved&#8217; from. Through a re-telling of this young boy&#8217;s journey travelling the Deep South, his education becomes the viewers&#8217; with a narration (by Carl Lumbly) of the boy as an adult recalling this past he will never forget. The history of the African American musician is his lesson, starting out in New Orleans and the blues music that stemmed from early 1900 to the 1940s turns into, as the director says, a &#8216;story that gives you the impression of the blues&#8217;. Inserted in the &#8216;educational&#8217; narrative is a combination of archival footage of the period, original performances and stills.

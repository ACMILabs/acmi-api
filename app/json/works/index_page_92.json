River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves play two young male prostitutes trying to survive homeless on the streets of Portland. A dazzling combination of realist street cinema, experimental narrative, and a homoerotic homage to Shakespeare, &#8220;My Own Private Idaho&#8221; is a stand-out, confronting independent film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Italy - Venice - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/my-own-private-idaho", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996688, "name": "Gus Van Sant", "creator_id": 2073, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996687, "name": "Laurie Parker", "creator_id": 25461, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996686, "name": "New Visions Pictures", "creator_id": 18254, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996685, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50302", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [32284], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92793, "acmi_id": "316123", "title": "Jesus' son [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jesus-son-dvd", "creator_credit": "Alison MacLean, Margot Bridger, David Urrutial, Lydia Dean Pilcher, Elizabeth Cutherell, Evenstar, Blue Sky Studios and Alliance Atlantis", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on Denis Johnson&#8217;s acclaimed gritty short story collection, also called &#8220;Jesus&#8217; Son&#8221;, this a finely observed drama about a young man&#8217;s descent into heroin abuse and small-time criminality in the early seventies.

Nine years later he returns a changed person, ostensibly having fought in the war. Though his appearance has altered beyond recognition, his wife (Nathalie Baye), finding him a much better lover and more responsible man than the one that left, accepts him wholeheartedly. Yet the villagers who knew him suspect he is not the man he claims to be, even though he possesses an insider&#8217;s knowledge of their lives. Matters come to a head when charges of deception are laid against him and Guerre is forced to defend his identity or face a death sentence. The ensuing court case of raises questions about the nature of identity, memory, perception, and how the passage of time can blur all three. This film was remade in Hollywood under the title &#8220;Sommersby&#8221; (1993) (also held in the collection).

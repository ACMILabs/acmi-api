As the criminals are thought to belong to an exclusive surfer cult, Utah learns to surf to infiltrate the group. Utah selects Tyler (Lori Petty), who is unaware of his true identity, to teach him the breaks that will make him a convincing surfer and keep his cover sound. Utah meets Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) a top surfer and adrenalin junkie, for whom surfing has a spiritual and mythical significance. &#8220;Point Break&#8221; is an action film that contains some impressive stunts including car chases, leaps from aeroplanes, exploding petrol stations and memorable scenes of breaking waves.

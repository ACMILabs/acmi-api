Rich in footage from verite classics, &#8216;Defining the Moment&#8217; looks at some of the most exciting and influential films made in the 20th century. Films like &#8216;Primary&#8217; (JFK on the campaign trail), &#8216;Lonely Boy&#8217; (Canadian superstar Paul Anka in Vegas), &#8216;Jane&#8217; (Fonda, before her Broadway debut), &#8216;Don&#8217;t Look Back&#8217;, &#8216;Salesmen&#8217; (door-to-door with Bible hustlers), &#8216;Pour la suite du monde&#8217; (For Generations to Come, on beluga fishermen in Quebec) and &#8216;Chronique d&#8217;un ete&#8217; (&#8216;Chronicle of a Summer&#8217;, the story of one summer in Paris).

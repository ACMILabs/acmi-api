"brief_description": "<p>Episode number 2 of Series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;.<br />\nSecond episode in the six-part series &#8220;Changing stages&#8221;, written and presented by Richard Eyre, about the history of theatre in the 20th century. This program focuses on Ireland and some of the Irish playwrights who gave birth to a new kind of theatre, one that had more substance than the 19th century Victorian melodrama and moralising society plays which were being performed in Britain, most significantly, at a time when Ireland was fighting for independence from British empirical connections. Richard Eyre discusses in great detail the influences and historical background of several Irish playwrights including William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Sean O&#8217;Casey, and J.M. Synge and the part these individuals played in the establishment of a national theatre and a national identity for Ireland. Yeats, Shaw and Wilde were all born in Dublin around the same time, but Shaw and Wilde very early on exiled themselves to England to make their fame and fortune through satirising the English high society. In contrast, against a background of political turmoil and tension, Yeats, in collaboration with Lady Augusta Gregory, conceived The Abbey Theatre which was to become Ireland&#8217;s national theatre and a stage for the works of Sean O&#8217;Casey and J.M. Synge, both playwrights who shared the belief that plays could be about contemporary events and the reality of people&#8217;s lives.

The aftermath of WW II influenced the direction of theatre and allowed a whole new generation of playwrights the freedom to express their anger, their political allegiance, social realism and an attitude that you could do or say what you want on stage - theatre became the instrument of social change. However, it was first German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), then Irish born Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) who inspired the 1960s and 70s generation of playwrights. Brecht, a communist, was known as a &#8220;theorist about theatre&#8221; who challenged the traditional values of theatre creating experimental and revolutionary works around his theory of alienation, promoting a style of acting and staging that created a distancing effect. Samuel Beckett was the man of evocative language, his plays often shrouded in despair and bleakness, combined with a lacing of caustic humor and left-wing politics.

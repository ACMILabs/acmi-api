Disaster follows Perry everywhere and Australia is no exception: earth tremors, a deceased roadside trader, inclement weather, a dangerous ex-boyfriend and New Year&#8217;s Eve at a roadhouse in the middle of nowhere after their bus crashes. A humorous coach war between the Whippet driver determined to out drive a competing driver of a swish coach also travelling to Darwin provides a highlight of the film, as is the Australian outback.

In this revisionist Western, Siegel frames the narrative within a series of identifiable dichotomies of the old/new West, horse power/machine engines, buggy/automobile and 19th/20th century mores. Also stars Jimmy Stewart as Books&#8217; aging doctor and Lauren Bacall. Original music by Elmer Bernstein.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "History&nbsp;→ Cowboys", "History&nbsp;→ Frontier and pioneer life", "People&nbsp;→ Cowboys", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962653, "name": "De Laurentiis Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 23143, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962654, "name": "M Frankovich", "creator_id": 28890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962655, "name": "William Self", "creator_id": 80134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962656, "name": "Don Siegel", "creator_id": 23467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962652, "name": "Force Video", "creator_id": 77898, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51205", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1976", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1976"}], "labels": [33091]}]}

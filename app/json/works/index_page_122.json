Filmed in the Louisiana swamps, director Walter Hill (Crossroads, 48 Hours, Last man standing) has succeeded in creating an atmospheric environ which heightens the tension and adds to the ever-increasing state of paranoia. Surreal and disturbing, &#8220;Southern comfort&#8221; bears a similarity to &#8220;Deliverance&#8221; where the environment and the local people become the focus of the story. As in &#8220;Deliverance&#8221;, music too plays an important part and it is the brilliant Ry Cooder who has composed and arranged the music for this film with cinematography by Andrew Laszlo. Cast includes Keith Carradine, Powers Boothe, Fred Ward, Peter Coyote, Carlos Brown.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Wilderness survival", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Wilderness survival", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Paranoia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Paranoia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/southern-comfort-1981", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962068, "name": "Phoenix Films", "creator_id": 13759, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962069, "name": "EMI/Parlophone", "creator_id": 14659, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962070, "name": "Cinema Group", "creator_id": 35046, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962071, "name": "David Giler", "creator_id": 71302, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962072, "name": "Walter Hill", "creator_id": 71303, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50870", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [32827], "external_references": [{"id": 186, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q8884557"}, {"id": 5451, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "12528"}]}, {"id": 93603, "acmi_id": "317113", "title": "South Park: bigger, longer & uncut [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "south-park-bigger-longer-uncut-dvd", "creator_credit": "Warner Bros Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Trey Parker and Matt Stone", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The boys from the American cult television program South Park launched onto the big screen in 1999 with their first feature length film &#8216;Bigger Longer and Uncut&#8217;, a cleverly written musical film looking at censorship and the influence film and television has on child development.

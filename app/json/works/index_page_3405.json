He is disillusioned when one of his pupils, Prince Einon, becomes a cruel King, and Bowen loses faith in the idealism that was once the source of his inner strength. Believing Einon&#8217;s soul to have been poisoned by a dragon, Bowen vows to destroy all dragons - without question or mercy. It is on this revenge quest for the good soul of Prince Einon that Bowen meets Draco (voice provided by Sean Connery), a dragon whose power, strength and wit are not easily defeated. As man and dragon contest in a life or death struggle, a friendship is formed that will change the face of the medieval world forever. Cast includes Dennis Quaid, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, Julie Christie and Dina Meyer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Legends", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Medieval", "History&nbsp;→ Legends", "Literature&nbsp;→ Arthurian romances - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Legends", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dragons", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956737, "name": "Rob Cohen", "creator_id": 60188, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956736, "name": "Raffaella De Laurentiis", "creator_id": 28337, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956735, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956734, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18762, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gmt3HRRgtsio4nRpaHZVKOTwH8W.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Dragonheart (Rob Cohen) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 500, "height": 750, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on.

You would always walk off the Kyneton ground four to six inches taller, because the black turfy ground from here used to build up on your boots.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Trenton and Woodend weren&#8217;t too bad when we played out with them. But the biggest trouble there was the snow. We played on Woodend, I think it was, at one stage on about 6 inches of snow.</p>\n<p>And I remember one of the players, real tough, hard player, come out. He says, Duusy, I&#8217;m gonna kill you, with a smile on his face. So during the game I thought I&#8217;d get even with him.</p>\n<p>I bent  down, picked up a handful of snow, squeezed it up hard in a ball, and let him have it behind the ear&#8212; not knowing that it had gone to ice. It nearly knocked him out. It was great fun. He just turned around and said, will you buy me a beer afterwards? And that was the way it was.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>If you meet up with some of the old players of those days, you still stop and have a talk about it. The subject is always football. You always get back to when we played. Wasn&#8217;t it good when we played? Wasn&#8217;t it different when we played?</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:10:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values":

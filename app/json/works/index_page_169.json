Julie&#8217;s nightmares become a reality upon discovering the fisherman is on the island seeking his revenge. Julie is forced to fess up to her friends about her tormented past as they struggle for their lives knowing they are caught in total isolation. Refreshingly, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; has subscribed to the new paradigm of teen horror, whereby the protagonist teen character is given personality and a surname. With a supporting cast that is less disposable than the teenager characters of slasher films of the past, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; is more suspenseful and more frightening, and a horror film that can stand on its own merit. Cast includes: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, Freddy Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Horror", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/i-know-what-you-did-last-summer-2-i-still-know-what-you-did-last-summer", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998812, "name": "Danny Cannon", "creator_id": 80645, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1164532", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998811, "name": "Neal H.

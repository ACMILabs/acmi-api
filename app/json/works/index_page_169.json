picks up the story of Yehia, the troubled adolescent boy headed for prosperity in America as WWII ravaged his Egyptian homeland. Yehia, now a draconian film director who neglects his wife and children in order to create his work, falls ill and requires open-heart surgery. During the operation a young boy, representing Yehia&#8217;s conscience, accuses him of betraying his ideals. A metamorphic trial ensues in which various witnesses, including family and colleagues, offer their testimony about &#8220;the defendant&#8221;. These proceedings force the filmmaker to come to terms with hidden emotions involving his life, work and country. Chahine&#8217;s work examines the politics of the 1952 revolution and its demise in 1967, as well as the frissons that arise as he tries to reconcile his art with his ambitions. This film recalls &#8220;Eight and a half&#8221; and &#8220;All that jazz&#8221; in that it examines one man&#8217;s conscience and history, in a humoristic, satirical and at times, surrealistic, manner.

Despite Julie&#8217;s reluctance, Nick joins them, forming an instant attraction to Paula, and from there the film takes a dramatic turn as Nick is drugged (by Paula) and the women conspire to exact revenge upon his prone body. Despite being linked by gender and the shared experience of operating within a patriarchy, money, knowledge and age divide these women, making them, at times, adversarial. The power plays between the two make for engrossing viewing; when Paula and Julie clash, they are operating from such different spectrums that they present a fascinating interplay of agendas and morality.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethics", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Manipulative behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Conflict (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hostility (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Manipulative behavior", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Psychology"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999367, "name": "Patrick Stettner", "creator_id": 36357, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999366, "name": "Robert H Nathan", "creator_id": 80796, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999365, "name": "Susan A Stover", "creator_id": 79283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999364, "name": "i5 Films", "creator_id": 36355, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999363, "name": "Headquarters", "creator_id": 36354, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999362, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52339", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33929], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94422, "acmi_id": "318272", "title": "Gangs of New York", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gangs-of-new-york-dvd", "creator_credit": "Martin Scorsese, Harvey Weinstein, Alberto Grimaldi, Australian National Football Council and Miramax Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>With &#8220;Gangs of New York&#8221; Martin Scorsese (Casino, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Last temptation of Christ) produced his most mainstream and commercially ambitious film to date. &#8220;Gangs&#8221; tells the story of New York as it was in the mid-19th century - a violent and untamed arena of gangs, immigrants, crooks and crime.

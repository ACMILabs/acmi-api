They share a warm and intimate relationship, often acting as though they were two children; playing games, quarreling and sharing toys.

He says if the kid misses him, then he can send him a letter to heaven.</p>\n<p>The two of them later go to the airport to meet his mother. The kid gets scared when she arrives. She has been in Belgium. She is happy at first and has brought  all kinds of toys from Europe, but gradually mum finds herself upset by the myriad little differences that have accumulated since she went away. One day, Chenchen and his pappi return home to find all his toys thrown out on the lawn.

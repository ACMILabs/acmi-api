Cast also includes Jackie Burroughs, Whip Hubley, Francoise Robertson, Domini Blythe, Swoosie Kurtz, and special appearances by Ed Asner and Sheila McCarthy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Adaptations&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Soap operas", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Soap operas", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Shared housing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Shared housing", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Mini-series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 883070, "name": "Productions La Fete", "creator_id": 35288, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883071, "name": "Channel Four Television", "creator_id": 25260, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883072, "name": "Working Title Films", "creator_id": 71468, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883073, "name": "Propaganda Films", "creator_id": 4061, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883074, "name": "Kevin Tierney", "creator_id": 80316, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883075, "name": "Pierre Gang", "creator_id": 80317, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51093", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33025]}, {"id": 93521, "acmi_id": "316976", "title": "More tales of the city.

George Robinson (Robin) Parsons was an amateur filmmaker who made home movies on a Bolex camera during the period 1929 to 1938. The home movies show life in Melbourne and regional Victoria in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>This film shows an example of life in Victoria, Australia, just prior to the Second World War. Much of it revolves around members of the Parsons family and friends who are clearly not camera shy. In a number of scenes, you can see individuals playing up to the camera. There is even a staged boxing match on the beach where Robin (George Robinson) Parsons experimented with using special effects.</p>\n<p>The film shows several Victorian locations including Melbourne, Dromana, Rosebud Aerodrome, Cape Schanck, Mt Hotham, Mallacoota, Wangarrata and Yallourn.

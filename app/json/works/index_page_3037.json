Her story is also exploited by the &#8216;yellow press&#8217;, which hounds her and depicts her as everything from loose woman to communist moll. And so, through the mirror of a manipulative press, Katharina becomes the most hated woman in Germany. The film achieves a compelling portrait of Germany in the mid-seventies (the lead years), during which the fight against the Red Army Faction led a number of State agencies to use any means possible to fight terrorism, while a manipulative right wing press sent an entire country in a frenzy over the breakdown of law and order. This originally made for TV production is adapted from the novel by Heinrich Boll (itself based on actual events).

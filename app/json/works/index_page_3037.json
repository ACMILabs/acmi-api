The battle between Bob Hawke and Paul Keating for the Labor Party leadership was one of the most divisive in Australian political history the seeds of which can be traced back as far as 1980. The series is an intensely personal examination of the Hawke-Keating relationship, and through more than 120 interviews with Cabinet Ministers, senior bureaucrats and staff advisers, the series offers an insider&#8217;s view of who wields power in Australia, and how. The five episodes are; &#8220;Taking power&#8221;, &#8220;Taxing times&#8221;, &#8220;Conserving power&#8221;, &#8220;The recession we had to have&#8221; and &#8220;The sweetest victory&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["05:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australian Labor Party", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Elections", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hawke, Bob, 1929-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Keating, Paul, 1944-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Leadership", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political parties", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politicians - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politics - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Power (Philosophy)", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History - 1965-", "History&nbsp;→ Australian Labor Party", "History&nbsp;→ Hawke, Bob, 1929-", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Keating, Paul, 1944-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Leadership", "People&nbsp;→ Hawke, Bob, 1929-", "People&nbsp;→ Keating, Paul, 1944-", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 784856, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 784857, "name": "Sue Spencer", "creator_id": 77599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 784855, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

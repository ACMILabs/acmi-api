This stunning costume was worn when the 15 year-old Pu-Yi (Wu Tao) wed&#8217;s the &#8216;old&#8217; government chosen first wife and Empress, 17-year old Wan Jung.<br />\nThe multi-layered costume consists of a thick white quilted gown with ties to the front, a red rayon brocade under robe overprinted in gold with panels in mulberry green and gold appliqué, high padded shoulders, tall collars, and cuffs trimmed in grey Astrakhan and Mongolian lambswool, and finally a waistcoat in maroon velvet and green brocade, overprinted in gold trimmed with antique fabric appliqués on the front and back panels. There are no sizes marked on this wonderful costume and it remains in excellent condition.<br />\nThis comes from the private collection of renowned producer Jeremy Thomas (who single handedly raised the $25million budget for the movie) and was archived after filming completed until only recently, when the Prop Store was proud to assist in sorting and cataloguing the incredible inventory under the guidance and in collaboration with Oscar-winning Costume Designer, Jim Acheson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>The Last Emperor, Italy / France, 1987<br />\nDesigned by James Acheson<br />\nSilk screened rayon fabric</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Moving Pictures&nbsp;→ MI-05.

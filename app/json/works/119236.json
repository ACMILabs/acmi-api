Archival film by John Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLES BLOWING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER:  I&#8217;d say it was about 1950, I started. And in those days, it was either a dropkick or a torp. And of course, the high-mark blokes always went crook if you weren&#8217;t kicking a dropkick, because they&#8217;d have a lark making torpedo kicks.</p>\n<p>The blokes who kicked good dropkicks were worth watching, but a lot of us, myself included, weren&#8217;t good dropkicks. And dropkicks were a problem because the ground, the surface changed. And OK, the natural base could always get away. But all the same, every now and again, you&#8217;d go to a different ground. Like you&#8217;d go up to the sandy ground up at Jeparit and even our best fellows would kick a grounder occasionally.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>JACK DUNLOP:  I loved it, actually. We were always doing it, from the time we first went to school. Because the drop punt had never been thought of when I gave it away. So we fancied it as a distance kick, on fine days. You didn&#8217;t do it on a wind day.</p>\n<p>Mainly the biggest thing with dropkicking was timing. If you didn&#8217;t time it, it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. But no, in later years, we had some pretty good big men, good high marks here. And your ambition was to get it as far as you could. They had a fair idea how far you could kick it, and you would kick to a contest. Not like today, where they won&#8217;t kick to a contest at all.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Those days, when they really used it, they all took their marks, went back and had their shots at goal and that. And they&#8217;d take up here but top it behind the head like this. Nobody ever does that these days.</p>\n<p>When you take a mark, you&#8217;ve got the ball. You&#8217;re got to have your ball in your hand ready, because there might be a handball or something. And those sort of things went out in the early &#8216;50s.</p>\n<p>ONLOOKER:  Let fly, Richie!</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER: Well, every coach I had tried to teach me how to kick dropkicks, and I never really mastered dropkicks. I remember playing one day and Jim Gulley was coaching, and I was playing center halfback. And Gulley didn&#8217;t mind me kicking them, because everyone else thought I&#8217;d kick them further than I did. And Gulley would lead up the ground and the center halfback wouldn&#8217;t follow him, because he thought he was getting too close to me. But that&#8217;s as far as I could kick the jolly things.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Nowadays with the drop punt, everyone kicks a drop punt and the balls so easy to handle. It doesn&#8217;t matter which leg you&#8217;re kicking. You&#8217;ve still got the ball in the same position to kick it. And it&#8217;s made a lot of difference to football, the drop punt, has. It&#8217;s one of the biggest challenges in the whole lot, I&#8217;d say.</p>",

Its ideals were high, just like the four photographers who created Magnum Photos - George Rodger, David Seymour (aka Chim), Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa and the intention of this co-operative was to create an ongoing pool of 50 professional photographers who, with shared beliefs about their photography, could go and cover every conceivable aspect of the human condition across the globe. In this documentary, German filmmaker Reiner Holzemer introduces some of the internationally recognised photographers currently with Magnum Photos and joins them in their field work in various parts of the world, including England with Martin Parr, Canada with Larry Towell, and Northern Ireland with Donovan Wylie. Also includes interviews with Philip Jones Griffiths, Eve Arnold, Marc Riboud, Burt Glinn, Rene Burri, Luc Delahay among others and provides an illuminating insight into the workings of Magnum Photos, considered one of today&#8217;s most prestigious photo agencies. Contains many great photo-images, some that are instantly recognisable, and provides an interesting and informative program on the topic of photography and photo-journalism.

The majority of the film takes place at Guy and Lizzie&#8217;s wedding day, a day in which Guy is plagued by memories of his previous girlfriend, Jenny (Frances O&#8217;Connor). In the most inappropriate place and at the most inopportune time, Guy is faced with a tough decision about his future with Lizzie, and his memories of a past relationship with a woman he has not seen for years. Cast also includes Linden Wilkinson, John Gaden and Genevieve Mooy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2324877, "name": "Cherie Nowlan", "creator_id": 24017, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5091950", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2324874, "name": "Jonathan Shteinman", "creator_id": 78263, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078846", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2324872, "name": "Stamen Films", "creator_id": 30651, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270672", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2324868, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45561", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [28108]}, {"id": 93470, "acmi_id": "316914", "title": "Than in the invisible war", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "than-in-the-invisible-war", "creator_credit": "Michel Regnier, Iolande Cadrin-Rossignol, National Film Board of Canada and UNICEF", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>For several decades Cambodia has suffered devastation and human tragedy from US bombings and the Khmer Rouge genocide, leaving the nation with a legacy of around six million land mines hidden in the fields and riverbanks.

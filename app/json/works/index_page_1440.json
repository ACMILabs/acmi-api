Just love going out there with the boys and kicking a few goals. That&#8217;s about all it is.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I get called some funny names. You know, great old bastard, and fossil, and things like that. But it doesn&#8217;t worry me. You get a hard time when your lining up for a goal or something. And you like to bloody kick the goal and say, well, there you go, smart-ass. Get that up ya. [LAUGHS]</p>\n<p>Me wife&#8217;s had a few digs at me about giving the game away, but I don&#8217;t think she was real serious about it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>BEV ALBERT:  From the very start, it was football. Football&#8217;s just part of your life. Yeah. I often say he&#8217;d give  up me before he&#8217;d give up sport. [CHUCKLES] I hope not.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;ll keep doing this for as long as he wants to.

So you just try and teach the young fellows some of the tricks of the trade, I suppose. And go back yourself and just have a go.</p>\n<p>[PLAYER TALKING TO TEAM IN LOCKER ROOM]</p>\n<p>Basically doing the same things I was doing when I was 15 or 16. Just try and get in front and lead hard and try and get the ball. And you know, I can&#8217;t kick any further than 40 meters. I never could. And start in the 10-yard square, and soon as you see an opening, just go. And if they deliberately hit you on the chest, well and good. You&#8217;ll get it for yourself.</p>\n<p>BEV ALBERT: I have nagged at times. But my main worry is injury. I worry that he might have an injury that&#8217;s not going to get better. That&#8217;s my basic concern, really. It&#8217;s the only reason why I&#8217;d like him to stop.

Juanita’s body has never been found and her murderers have never been charged.</p>\n<p><i>The Beehive</i> consists of scripted fictions, documentary interviews and choreographed scenes with multiple actors playing the role of Juanita. The film is ever-changing, as a different combination of footage is randomly selected for each screening with 1,344 possible variations. <i>The Beehive</i> therefore continually morphs and evolves to reveal different interpretations of this violent historical act and its social context.  Operating like a forensic investigation, the film presents a variety of puzzle pieces, asking new questions and potentially pointing to an answer.</p>\n<p>The title is a reference to Juanita Nielsen’s famous hairdo but is also a metaphor for human cities. In classical times the beehive was seen as a hierarchical and densely industrious hub; in pre-Christian symbolism the beehive was a dark cooperative womb guided by a powerful queen.

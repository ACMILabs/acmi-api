Charlie Rogers is a coffee-house singer who joins a financially troubled carnival. He is hired by owner, Maggie Morgan, and soon catches the eye of his pretty female co-worker, Cathy Lean. Cathy&#8217;s irate father, Joe, clashes with Charlie when he tries to romance his daughter, but Charlie&#8217;s singing and looks helps bring in the much-needed money for the near-bankrupt carnival. Cast includes Elvis Presley, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Freeman and Leif Erickson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Carnival", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Carnival", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Carnival", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956559, "name": "John Rich", "creator_id": 16523, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956558, "name": "Hal B Wallis", "creator_id": 22879, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956557, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956556, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44354", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [27289]}, {"id": 62147, "acmi_id": "tmdb-movie-16463", "title": "Roundhay Garden Scene", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "roundhay-garden-scene", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1888", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1888-10-14T09:40:00+09:40", "brief_description": "<p>The earliest surviving celluloid film, and believed second moving picture ever created, was shot by Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince using the LPCCP Type-1 MkII single-lens camera.

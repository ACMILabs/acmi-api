The riots that erupted in the cities throughout the United States forced basic issues of injustice to the surface for all Americans to face. There are no easy ways to solve the problems caused by prejudice, but examples are given of areas in which government, business, and black and white people are working together to wipe out the hatred and misunderstanding between the races.

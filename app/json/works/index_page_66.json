Twelve year-old Yusef (Mohammad Nahhal) lives in a refugee camp with his mother and older sister. His father is in prison and his older brother is on the run from the Israeli soldiers. To escape the surrounding violence Yusef constantly lives in an imaginary world, but it is his bird hunting in the near-by countryside that allows Yusef a sense of freedom and space. It is here that Yusef meets Aida (Hana Nemah), the wild and lovely young gypsy girl from a local gypsy camp, whose beguiling eyes and smile Yusef finds hard to resist. He soon declares his love for Aida telling her he will marry her when they grow up. However Aida sets a task for Yusef before she will agree to marriage, that being he must first find three jewels missing from her grandmother&#8217;s necklace, which was brought from South America by her grandfather.

These three young Palestinian friends from such disparate backgrounds are each portrayed sensitively by the young actors involved. Combine this with superb direction from Michel Khleifi (Wedding in Galilee, Forbidden marriages in the Holy Land), stunning cinematography by Raymond Fromont, and the fact that it is the first feature film ever to be shot in the Gaza Strip, makes &#8220;Tale of the three jewels&#8221; compelling viewing.

Aiditi is a modern woman, frustrated by her long-term affair with a married man, who decides to partake in an arranged marriage to Hemant, an Indian engineer living in Houston. As both chaotic families gather in Delhi for the festivities, ancestral dynamics, errant children and an ambivalent bride complicate the efforts of patriarch, Lalit Verma to organise the wedding. The disorientation of the groom, pondering the machinations of the intricate proceedings, reflects the nature of an extended family, spread across the globe that reunites only occasionally. Convenient plot contrivances and some pat conclusions compromise the script&#8217;s more complex demands, which touches on such issues of child abuse and adultery. Nevertheless the sheer exuberance of the film, coupled with a gaudy palette, teeming with marigolds (the traditional Indian wedding flower) displays Nair&#8217;s affection for and celebration of ceremony despite the evidence that established rituals are collapsing under the strain of modernisation, pre-marital sex and female emancipation.

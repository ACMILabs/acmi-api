Directed by Barry Levinson (Diner, Rain man, Good morning Vietnam, Wag the dog), the film plots Bugsy&#8217;s rise to infamy as a crook and ruthless power broker in LA throughout the 1940s. It also documents Bugsy&#8217;s tumultuous relationship with Hollywood starlet, Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) who seduces Bugsy with Tinseltown glamour, despite the fact that he is married with children. Bugsy is depicted as a vain, sartorial womaniser whose violent ways make him feared and loathed amidst the mobsters with whom he fraternises. His ultimate extravagant dream, to see a bacchanalian oasis in the desert, is built with the funds of his ruthless mob boss Meyer Lanksky (Ben Kingsley).

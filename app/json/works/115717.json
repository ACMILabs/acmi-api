However Bair escapes and leads the Mongolian army against the interventionists. The intensity of the drama, strong feeling for landscape and dramatic use of montage (4 or 5 times the usual number of shots for a feature of this length) have been compared with the work of D. W. Griffith. In effect, the film is one long chase which takes on mythic proportions while the plot takes on metaphoric and lyrical dimensions (the British army is literally &#8216;blown away&#8217;).

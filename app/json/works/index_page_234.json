Based on the Cornell Woolrich novel &#8220;Black Alibi&#8221;, &#8216;The Leopard man&#8217; utilizes to great effect, a subtle, moody soundtrack and expressionistic lighting to suggest rather than show, proving that the imagination can sometimes be more terrifying. Like their previous collaboration&#8217;s &#8216;Cat People&#8217; (1942) and &#8216;I Walked with a Zombie&#8217; (1943), the film is made up of a series of chilling set pieces that unnerve and linger rather than shock in their disquieting tone and atmosphere. Cast includes Margo, Dennis O&#8217;Keefe, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell and James Bell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Circus animals", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Leopards", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus animals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-leopard-man", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996428, "name": "Jacques Tourneur", "creator_id": 77041, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55393", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996427, "name": "Val Lewton", "creator_id": 77040, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q221917", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996426, "name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "creator_id": 71465, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996425, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50178", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1943", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1943"}], "labels": [32174], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92683, "acmi_id": "315998", "title": "I Walked with a zombie", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-walked-with-a-zombie", "creator_credit": "Jacques Tourneur, Val Lewton and RKO Radio Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1943", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1943-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In this hauntingly loose transposition of Charlotte Bronte&#8217;s &#8220;Jane Eyre&#8221; to the West Indies, a nurse, summoned to look after a sick woman, falls in love with the brooding husband and encounters voodoo.

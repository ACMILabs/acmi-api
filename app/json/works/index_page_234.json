The year is 1972 and Fielding Pierce is a young ambitious working-class Coast Guard officer determined to become president of the United States. He meets Sarah Williams, a Catholic activist of left persuasion with a strong anti-American bent, and a great love is immediately born. However, despite their profound and intense connection - both physical and spiritual - Fielding and Sarah represent different perspectives on matters of politics, social change, and America as a nation. The era in which they live - Vietnam, military dictatorship in Chile, post-Cold War - not only tests their allegiances but foregrounds their different values and questions the possibility of their relationship.

Lang and her cast have plenty of fun with the unlikely coupling of the gritty film noir genre and the cliquey Sydney poetry scene, mixing the two at times to witty effect. Lang and screenwriter Anne Kennedy also play with the literary form by dividing the film into chapter headings and having the characters recite some of Dorothy Porter&#8217;s elegant prose. Cast includes Deborah Mailman, Marton Csokas, William Zappa, Chris Haywood and Annie Jones.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murderers", "Erotica", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "Places&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996367, "name": "Samantha Lang", "creator_id": 11187, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996366, "name": "John Maynard", "creator_id": 51466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996365, "name": "Robert Connolly", "creator_id": 64647, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996364, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996363, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996362, "name": "Arenafilm", "creator_id": 64646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996361, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50148", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32148], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92657, "acmi_id": "315966", "title": "The Most fertile man in Ireland", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-most-fertile-man-in-ireland", "creator_credit": "Dudi Appleton, David Collins, Alibi Films and Sky Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Eamon is a nerdish love-lorn 24-year-old virgin who lives with his mother and works for a dating agency.

Fed up with paranoid lovers, endless bundles of blood test results, and the consuming fear of investing emotionally in a partner he may lose to AIDS, Jeffrey decides to give up sex for good. He rationalises that this will allow him to channel his energy into his career and hobbies, which in turn will help him to forget about sex. However, his resolve is soon put to the test when he meets the gorgeous body-builder Steve (Michael T. Weiss) while working out at the gym. Torn between wanting to ravish Steve and wanting to maintain his celibacy, Jeffrey turns to his best friend Sterling (Patrick Stewart) for advice. As circumstances (and friends) conspire to bring Steve and Jeffrey together, Jeffrey begins to warm to the idea of a committed relationship. However, Steve&#8217;s revelation about his HIV-positive status soon throws a spanner in the works and Jeffrey finds himself caught between love and fear once again. Seeking the advice of Sterling and his partner Darius, a post-modern evangelist, a self-help group, his liberal parents, and a randy Catholic priest, Jeffrey struggles to come to terms with the concept that a life lived in fear is no life at all. Features a variety of cameos from stars such as Sigourney Weaver, Camryn Manheim, Olympia Dukakis, Kathy Najimy, Christine Baranski, and Nathan Lane.

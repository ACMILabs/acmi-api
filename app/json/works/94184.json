Elizabethan express: From King&#8217;s Cross Station, London, to Waverley Station, Edinburgh, is 393 miles. The Elizabethan - a summertime express - does this journey in six and a half hours non-stop - the longest daily non-stop run in the world to be timed at over 60 mph in 1954. This film is about one of those runs and the people behind the service.

The Motive Power, Operating and Engineering Departments of British Transport go to work with snow-ploughs to reach the trapped train. Working through the night the team dig clear, and thaw out moving parts, and finally two engines help to clear the line.

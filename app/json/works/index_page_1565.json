Dialogue is pared down to a minimum; instead the camera observes its characters framed against the contrasting urban sprawl of Tokyo and the windswept coast of rural Japan. The meditative and richly poetic mise-en-scene explores the importance of environment, nature and landscape in defining a person&#8217;s relationship to the world. Recalling the films of Japan&#8217;s celebrated director Ozu, &#8220;Maborosi&#8221; is a deeply affecting and richly rewarding art film which reaffirms that cinema too can be a place for the creation of transcendental and spiritual works that assist in defining that complex, ambiguous phenomena which is the human condition.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Landscape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Japan - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995771, "name": "Hirokazu Koreeda", "creator_id": 79762, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q740758", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995770, "name": "Kore-eda", "creator_id": 79761, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995769, "name": "Naoe Gozu", "creator_id": 33482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995768, "name": "TV Man Union", "creator_id": 33454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49722", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [31782], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92291, "acmi_id": "315523", "title": "I Stand alone = Seul contre tous (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-stand-alone-seul-contre-tous-d", "creator_credit": "Gaspar Noe, Lucile Hadzihalilovic, Les Cinemas de la Zone and Alliance Atlantis", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An unemployed butcher returns to his native Paris after having bashed his lover and forced her to miscarriage.

Set in 1980, the film explores a post-industrial world in which capitalism has seemingly no more need for the labourers and workers which it previously employed to generate wealth. As the butcher walks the graffiti strewn desolate streets of northern Paris, passing shut down factories and warehouses, he is continually giving vent to destructive homophobic, misogynist and racist fantasies, blaming everyone except himself for the alienation and menial servitude of his life. Employing startling effects of sound and editing to simulate the increasing paranoia and madness of its protagonist, &#8220;I Stand Alone&#8221; is an alarming and terrifying exploration of a society that has seemingly lost all egalitarian and communal values; a society in which the accumulation of wealth and the integrity of exchange are the only values and ethics that count. By the end of the film, as the butcher degenerates into complete solipsism and lunacy, he articulates a value system for this new age based on idolisation of rape, incest and murder. The film is as a passionate, ambiguous and disturbing exploration of the attraction of neo-fascism for the French indigenous working class. In French with English subtitles.

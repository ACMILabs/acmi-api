A cross-dressing black comedy, &#8220;Gaudi afternoon&#8221; is an amusing undertaking from director Susan Seidelman (Desperately seeking Susan, She-devil), who spent ten years directing for television before returning to film with this feature. Seidelman never seems to quite make all the elements gel but the impressive cast and beautiful locale go some way to making the film an enjoyable ride. Fans of &#8220;Desperately seeking Susan&#8221; may be interested to decipher the similarities between the two narratives here.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Spain", "Places&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924217, "name": "Lola Films", "creator_id": 27983, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924218, "name": "Antenna 3 Television", "creator_id": 35419, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924219, "name": "Via Digital", "creator_id": 35420, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924220, "name": "Andres Gomes", "creator_id": 27985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924221, "name": "Susan Seidelman", "creator_id": 12438, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51204", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 14, "name": "Spain", "slug": "spain"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33090]}, {"id": 108001, "acmi_id": "B1000854", "title": "Gauchi and Howson interview", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gauchi-and-howson-interview", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Gauchi and Howson interview</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 727587, "name": "Daryl Dellora", "creator_id": 6331, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewer", "role_id": 457, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "215", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [47494]}, {"id": 89498, "acmi_id": "312297", "title": "Gattaca [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gattaca-dvd", "creator_credit": "Jersey Films, Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher and Andrew Niccol", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Niccol&#8217;s debut as a director, a year before he wrote the script for &#8216;The Truman Show&#8217;, is set in a near-future where the lives of the majority of citizens are determined before birth through genetic engineering of their genes, and the &#8216;natural-born&#8217; minority of &#8216;In-Valids&#8217; is shunned.

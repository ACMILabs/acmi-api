Dromana Beach is featured a few times and appears to be a family favourite for swimming and family gatherings.</p>\n<p>This film is rich with fashion of the period, both casual and formal, including two weddings of different periods and golfing attire.</p>\n<p>Included in the film is the 1935 centennial celebrations parade showing crowded street with brass bands travelling down Collins Street, including a brief scene of an Aboriginal float. Much of these scenes are taken from the rooftop of Parsons Bros and company building. The company would later form Uncle Toby’s.</p>\n<p>The film also includes the Shrine of Remembrance, St Pauls cathedral, Princes Bridge and many other Melbourne landmarks including some buildings and sites that no longer exist.</p>\n<p>Of interest are the many forms of transport that are seen throughout which include cars, trams, horses, bicycles, motor bike with side carriage, a canoe, bi planes, fighter planes, a gyrocopter, the Saro A17 Cutty Sark seaplane (only 12 were ever created), transport planes, steamboats, tugboats, a navy ship, locomotives and a Melbourne ferry.</p>\n<p>Also of interest is a scene from the 1939 Australian Championship at Kooyong Stadium with John Bromwich and Adrian Quist.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:21:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1487520, "name": "George Parsons", "creator_id": 84854, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119162, "acmi_id": "B2004316", "title": "[George Robinson Parsons Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "george-robinson-parsons-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "George Parsons", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1929-1938", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 118229, "acmi_id": "B2004318", "title": "[George Robinson Parsons Home Movies: Reel 2]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "george-robinson-parsons-home-movies-reel-2", "creator_credit": "George Parsons", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1929-1938", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "183648", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1929-1939", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1929-1939"}], "labels": [57732], "external_references": []}, {"id": 119162, "acmi_id": "B2004316", "title": "[George Robinson Parsons Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "george-robinson-parsons-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "George Parsons", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1929-1938", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>The George Robinson Parsons Home Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 16mm film.

Sternberg reversed the meaning of Heinrich Mann&#8217;s novel &#8220;Professor Unrath&#8221; by making the professor a foolish, repressed victim rather than the corrupt and hypocritical exploiter of Lola portrayed in the novel. The film already shows Sternberg&#8217;s interest in visual density rather than narrative vigour, creating atmosphere rather than narrative tension, a preference for the maximum expressiveness of decor and lighting over surface realism. Stars Marlene Dietrich, Emil Jannings, Hans Albers and Kurt Gerron.

The camera has captured some rather up-close and disturbing images of the physical violence dealt by the police to the protesters, particularly in the first two days of the Summit. It was estimated that over 10,000 protesters managed to prevent 150-200 participants from attending the Summit on Day 1. This led to a heightened reaction from the Police on Day 2 resulting in the injuring and hospitalisation of 30 protesters. By Day 3, with a smaller crowd of protesters in attendance, and a somewhat calmer atmosphere between police and protesters, the focus of S-11 turned to the effects of globalisation on women and indigenous people around the world. The film features footage and interviews with several of the protesters, union leaders, local entities, politicians including Richard Court (Premier W.A.), Steve Bracks (Premier, Vic.), Denis Napthine (Opp. Leader, Vic.), Bob Brown (Sen. Aust. Greens), Peter Costello (Aust. Fed. Treasurer) and inside footage of speakers at the Summit, the highlight of which was Dr Vandana Shiva speaking on behalf of the young people of Australia and the world. The three-day non-violent campaign by S-11 protesters against globalisation was witnessed by the international media, including the BBC, subsequently putting Melbourne on the world stage, alongside Seattle, in the voicing of its opposition to the WEF and what it stands for.

Klibansky discusses his life, analyses his philosophy and its relationship to world events and humanity and provides perhaps a different slant on world history during the 20th century. Included in the documentary are stills, photographs, archival newsreel footage and interviews with Sonja Sutton-Steiniger (Klibansky&#8217;s sister), Ethel Groffier (his wife), Georges Leroux (philosopher and friend), Rainer Maria Lepsius (sociologist), Jana Patocka (daughter of philosopher Jan Patocka) among others. Voice and narration by Claudio Besso in English with some interviews in French with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Humanism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Philosophers, Modern", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Philosophy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political activists", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Philosophy - Study and teaching", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "History&nbsp;→ Humanism", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Klibansky, Raymond, 1905-", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 818389, "name": "Anne-Marie Tougas", "creator_id": 80638, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 818388, "name": "Yves Bisaillon", "creator_id": 80311, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 818387, "name": "Tele-Quebec", "creator_id": 80637, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 818386, "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "creator_id": 66965, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 818385, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51954", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33594]}, {"id": 77838, "acmi_id": "33621", "title": "Raygun's nightmare", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "rayguns-nightmare", "creator_credit": "Peter Wallach, David Jablin, Atlantic Television and Imagination Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1982", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>An animated satire combining a mixture of live, puppets and computer animation, on American politics in which President Raygun has a terrible nightmare about the invasion of America by a huge Japanese electronic monster.

The King felt that Figaro was impudent and disrespectful as a lower-class citizen because of the way he treats his superiors in the play. According to Louis XVI, the foundations of European social structure would be in jeopardy should this play be allowed to be produced - the truth of the matter was that private shows were going on all over Paris. The King finally acquiesced and the play was given publicly on April 27, 1784 - but not without a fair share of cuts and subtractions. Consequently, the play was a huge success, and was soon translated into German. On January 31st, 1785, Joseph II of Austria gave a memorandum prohibiting a German version from appearing in Vienna. It was not long after this edict was given that Mozart suggested to da Ponte that they use it as a subject for his new Italian opera. &#8216;Le mariage de Figaro&#8217; (actually finished in 1778) is one of three in a set of plays written by Beaumarchais.

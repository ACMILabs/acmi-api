In &#8220;Two Bob Mermaid&#8221; Darlene Johnson presents a beautifully filmed story about a young girl who can pass for white in a racially divided 1957 Australia. Warwick Thornton&#8217;s &#8220;Payback&#8221; presents a surreal story of a young convict who has to obey tribal lore as much as he does white law. Bill McCrow&#8217;s &#8220;Black Man Down&#8221; explores the need for contemporary Aborigines to be aware of the lessons and spirituality of the past.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:16:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Religion", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Women", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australian prisoners - Death", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 903995, "name": "Australian Film Commission", "creator_id": 66813, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903996, "name": "Australia.

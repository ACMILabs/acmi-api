In series one, set on the day of the California Presidential Primary elections, Jack Bauer and his staff discover an attempt will be made on politician David Palmer&#8217;s life. Whilst battling to foil the assassination, Jack suspects that a double-crosser is working within the CTU. Meanwhile Jack&#8217;s daughter has snuck out of the house, and is missing, but unbeknownst to her she is a part of the intricate assassination plot.

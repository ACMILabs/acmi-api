The hero, Priest, is a tough pimp and drug trafficker, who snorts cocaine throughout the movie and has little time for white people and their rules. The film follows his misadventures as he attempts to go straight in a world where the straights don&#8217;t want him. With limited resources, Parks Jr manages to create a highly entertaining and fast-paced thriller, fuelled by a brutal lead performance by Ron O&#8217;Neal and a stunning score by soul and funk musician, Curtis Mayfield.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Blaxploitation films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Soul music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 873840, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 873841, "name": "Sig Shore", "creator_id": 30526, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 873842, "name": "Gordon Parks Jr", "creator_id": 30527, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 873839, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45360", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [27922], "external_references": []}, {"id": 76390, "acmi_id": "014322", "title": "Superfluous people", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "superfluous-people", "creator_credit": "WCBS-TV and Warren Wallace", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1962", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A grim and unremitting survey of New York citizens exiled at the margins of capitalist society including the elderly displaced by new housing construction; a woman on relief whose husband was recently released from a mental institution; and those who live in the slums of New York.

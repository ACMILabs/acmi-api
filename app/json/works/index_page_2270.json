The characters&#8217; actions and behaviours are presented straightforwardly without moralising, enabling an open-ended exploration of the way class differences play out in power relations between the sexes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915840, "name": "Action Films", "creator_id": 28188, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915841, "name": "Gaumont-British Instructional", "creator_id": 12382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915842, "name": "Klaus Hellwig", "creator_id": 77444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915843, "name": "Yves Gasser", "creator_id": 79374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915844, "name": "Maurice Pialat", "creator_id": 36435, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52382", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [33958], "external_references": []}, {"id": 69934, "acmi_id": "006516", "title": "Louisiana story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "louisiana-story", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1946", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1946-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Louisiana Story is an enchanting record of the infatuation of a French Cajun boy with the wild landscape of the forest marshes of South Louisiana.

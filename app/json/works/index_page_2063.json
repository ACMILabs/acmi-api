In 1956 he immigrated to Australia to be re-united with his remaining family. Episode 11: Leopoldine Mimovich learnt sculpture in her home city of Salzburg, Austria. Arriving in Australia in 1949, she found living as a female artist a demanding calling. Episode 12: Nicolas Habib, born in Egypt to a Greek mother and Lebanese father, was a foreigner in his own homeland. Upon becoming effectively stateless, he moved to Australia where his lack of English saw his skills denigrated, forcing him to adapt to a life of hard labour.

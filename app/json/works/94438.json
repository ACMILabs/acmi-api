Daiga is an aspiring Lithuanian actress, who arrives in Paris expecting work but finds few opportunities open to her; Theo is a musician and carpenter from Martinique, estranged from the French mother of his young child, who longs to return to his family and homeland; Camille, his brother, is a beautiful drag queen and part time prostitute, joylessly making his way in the gay scene.

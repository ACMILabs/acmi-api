A large focus is on Kylie Mingoue, a phenomenally successful pop artist who has reinvented herself numerous times through her stellar career. Other artists such as Todd Hunter (from &#8220;Dragon&#8221;) talk about the self-destructive streak within the band that sabotaged potential worldwide success; a sentiment echoed by James Freud from &#8220;The Models&#8221;. Another artist examined in John Farnham, whose early success meant he was poison to radio stations for a time, but whose music won out through the persistence of his manager Glenn Wheatly. Also examines the succes of bands &#8220;Air supply&#8221;, &#8220;Crowded house&#8221; and &#8220;Savage garden&#8221;.

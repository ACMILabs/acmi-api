The only men who survive are those who revel in war and destruction. Men like Sargeant Steiner (James Coburn). And men who won&#8217;t risk their necks for anything. Men like Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Stransky is new to the ugliness of front-line battles, but determined to win himself some glory before he returns home. The one thing he wants above all is the supreme symbol of bravery - the Iron Cross. And he wants Steiner to win it for him - and get blown apart while doing so. Stranky&#8217;s determination to obtain that coveted emblem of bravery at whatever cost is the background to Sam Peckinpah&#8217;s gripping story of men living at extremes and fighting for their lives.

Each of them wears a quirky nickname: Goupi Tisane (herbal tea), Goupi Cancan (chatterbox), etc  But two of the Goupi have chosen to live outside the clan: Goupi Mains Rouges (red hands), poacher and witchdoctor and Goupi Tonkin, a former colonial soldier. One day, Goupi Tisane is found murdered in the forest. &#8216;Goupi Mains Rouges&#8217; is one of the great successes of French cinema of the Occupation. At a time the Vichy regime was extolling the virtues of life on the land, the film delivered a biting satire of country life and country folks.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Jean Mugeli ; director, Jacques Becker ; writer, Pierre Very ; photography, Jean Bourgoin ; music, Jean Alfaro ; editor, Marguerite Renoir.<br />\nCast: Fernand Ledoux, Georges Rollin, Blanchette Brunoy, Robert Le Vigan, Line Noro, Maurice Schutz.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890422, "name": "Jean Mugeli", "creator_id": 82977, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890423, "name": "Jacques Becker", "creator_id": 82950, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146642", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1943", "notes": "", "to_year": "1943"}], "labels": [55417]}, {"id": 99153, "acmi_id": "509225", "title": "Gould League snake show.

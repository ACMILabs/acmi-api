Mao joins his troops and embarks on a vast journey through the mountains and across extremely rough terrain. He is depicted as an equal to his soldiers and is shown walking and socialising with all ranks of his army.<br />\nChiang Kai-Shek decides to buy extremely technologically advanced war instruments from the US government officials and uses them to locate exactly where Mao is and determine where he is going. The equipment informs the Nationalist Party that Mao and his followers are heading towards Russia to seek shelter from the applied communist forces led by Joseph Stalin. The Nationalists immediately send their highly trained army named ‘Division 36’ to capture Mao.<br />\nThe Nationalist army travel through the harsh conditions of the desert and when they make it to the other side they are absolutely exhausted. They plan a large-scale sneak attack but even after their fervent tracking efforts are unable to locate the communist army. Mao and his army are strategically hiding in the mountain ranges and when they see the Nationalist Party lurking directionless, they launch an organised and vicious attack that completely wipes out the notorious ‘Division 36’. Mao and his followers rejoice in their landslide victory over the Nationalist army.<br />\nAfter the battle the members of the Kunlum Column no longer need to conceal their identity and come out of hiding. They meet with Mao at a Buddhist temple and are thrilled to be reunited. At the temple Mao draws a stick from a monk that is said to predict the future – the stick reads “most lucky”. Mao plans his next major attack against Chang Kai-Shek but is very content at have reclaimed so much land after their latest victory – which was all thanks to the courage and superior intellect of the Kunlun Column.<br />\n(Haydn Green 2013).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism and social sciences", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1162512, "name": "Sheng Dong", "creator_id": 82859, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1162513, "name": "August First Film Studio", "creator_id": 34754, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1162514, "name": "Jin Mu-Kui", "creator_id": 82860, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1162515, "name": "Sheng Dong", "creator_id": 82859, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1162516, "name": "Zhang KeYao", "creator_id": 82861, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1162517, "name": "Sun Feihu", "creator_id": 82282, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1162518, "name": "Lu Xi", "creator_id": 82862, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1162519, "name": "Su Lin", "creator_id": 82635, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146483", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [55328], "external_references": []}, {"id": 69452, "acmi_id": "005935", "title": "The Kremlin", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-kremlin", "creator_credit": "NBC News", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A guided tour of the Kremlin recreating events in Russian history associated with the building from the 12th century up until its present day role as a museum and seat of the Social Government.

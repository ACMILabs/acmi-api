At her beguiling best, Deborah Kerr plays a prim English lady whose husband has vanished into the jungle while searching for the legendary mines of King Solomon. Stewart Granger&#8217;s portrayal of Allan Quartermain, &#8220;white hunter&#8221; and reluctant leader of the danger fraught expedition, is one of the finest roles of his swashbuckling career. &#8220;King Solomon&#8217;s Mines&#8221; offers a colourful palette of action, danger, suspense, drama and romance. Particularly exciting are the extraordinary animal stampedes captured by Robert Sutees&#8217; Oscar winning cinematography.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Swashbucklers", "Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Swashbucklers", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 950906, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950907, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950908, "name": "Sam Zimbalist", "creator_id": 76868, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950909, "name": "Compton Bennett", "creator_id": 25044, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 950910, "name": "Andrew Marton", "creator_id": 25045, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 950905, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38819", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1950", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1950"}], "labels": [22406]}, {"id": 69408, "acmi_id": "005884", "title": "King penguins: a study of these birds in captivity", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "king-penguins-a-study-of-these-birds-in-captivity", "creator_credit": "Gaumont-British Instructional and Mary Field", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1950", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this study of King Penguins in their natural surroundings in the Antarctic, and also in the Edinburgh Zoo, the use of the flippers and feet in swimming are shown by underwater slow-motion cinematography.

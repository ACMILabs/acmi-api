An interesting and illuminating series.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Love is in the air&#8221;.<br />\nEpisode three of &#8220;Love is in the air&#8221; looks at the imprecise science of success in the pop music business. A large focus is on Kylie Mingoue, a phenomenally successful pop artist who has reinvented herself numerous times through her stellar career. Other artists such as Todd Hunter (from &#8220;Dragon&#8221;) talk about the self-destructive streak within the band that sabotaged potential worldwide success; a sentiment echoed by James Freud from &#8220;The Models&#8221;. Another artist examined in John Farnham, whose early success meant he was poison to radio stations for a time, but whose music won out through the persistence of his manager Glenn Wheatly. Also examines the succes of bands &#8220;Air supply&#8221;, &#8220;Crowded house&#8221; and &#8220;Savage garden&#8221;. Interviewees include Michael Gudinski, Glenn Wheatly, Nick Seymour, Darren Hayes and Kylie. Episode 4 (final) celebrates some of the greatest Australian songs and their writers, the stories behind which illustrate the ephemeral nature of pop songwriting. Interviewees include: James Reyne, Mark Seymour, Neil Finn, Richard Clapton and John Paul Young. An interesting and illuminating series.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Love songs", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Songs", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Women singers", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1121468, "name": "Tony Wyzenbeek", "creator_id": 81118, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121467, "name": "Richard Stomps", "creator_id": 81117, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121466, "name": "Paul Clarke", "creator_id": 739, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1121465, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1121464, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115628, "acmi_id": "58811", "title": "Love is in the air", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "love-is-in-the-air", "creator_credit": "Paul Clarke and Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2003", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 95004, "acmi_id": "53065", "title": "Love is in the air.

This remains an important film although the reasons for its importance have changed over time. What is now most apparent is a particular stylisation which passed for realism. The use of non-professional actors, real locations and the absence of a complex story-line and characterisation, disguise the carefully calculated and detailed mise-en-scene, the stylised representation of an authentic environment. The son has been set up to create a sentimental commentary on the central dilemma. This engenders an empathy with the characters qualitatively different from the more usual identification.

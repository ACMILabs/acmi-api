Devastated he seeks redemption in a shrine, shaving heads of monks in the region, pondering his future, and being tempted by a widower (also played by Joan Chen) who visits the shrine seeking burial for her husband. Shot in an atmospheric blue hue, the plot of Clara Law&#8217;s film is at times hard to fathom, however it&#8217;s easy to savour the epic proportions of the film, the mesmerising battle scenes, and witness the restrained performance of the two leads as they manage to imbue their scenes with sensuality and passion.

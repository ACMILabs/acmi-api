Yes! Mickey Mouse imposes the &#8216;talkies&#8217; in France. Ironically, it was Rene Clair, one of the most vociferous opponents of sound, who directed the first great French sound film, &#8216;Sous les toits de Paris&#8217;<em>, at the Epinay studios in 1930. Although the film did manifest an adventurous use of sound - privileging songs while reducing dialogue to a minimum, and including some counterpoint experiments, in which sound and image were not synchronised - it was most notable for Lazare Meerson&#8217;s set design, which evoked a realistic yet lyrical picture of working-class Paris.&#8221; Reference: Guy Austin. &#8216;Contemporary French cinema&#8217;.

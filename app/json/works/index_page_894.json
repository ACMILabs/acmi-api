When several family members become stranded and their lives are imperilled, Ducky learns the value of respecting her elders, particularly Mr Thicknose, a dinosaur with whom he falls into constant conflict. Although the plot is trite, and the dialogue cloying, this animated children&#8217;s movie still entertains as it imagines the world inhabited by dinosaurs. Features frequent musical interludes and the voices of Jeff Bennett, Rob Paulsen, Aria Noelle Curzon, Thomas Dekker, Robert Guillaume, Susan Krebs and Kenneth Mars.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dinosaurs", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Prehistoric life", "Motion picture sequels", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924561, "name": "Charles Grosvenor", "creator_id": 27508, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924560, "name": "Universal Studios", "creator_id": 23708, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 924559, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51648", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33365]}, {"id": 85373, "acmi_id": "306761", "title": "The Land before time III: The time of the great giving", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-land-before-time-iii-the-time-of-the-great-giving", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1995", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Join your favourite prehistoric past, Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike and Pete - plus three mischevious new dinosaurs - for another exciting adventure.

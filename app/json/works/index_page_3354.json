As the alienation increases they drift to other people and Daniel begins an affair with one of his nurses while Mary Ellen fantasises about the family gardener. With their marriage well and truly over, Mary Ellen clings to the security of her once happy home, chaining herself to painful memories. Finally, she realises that to move on with her life she must leave the house that once contained the happiness of her marriage.

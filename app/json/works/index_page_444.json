The young man&#8217;s return, however, results in his personal confrontation with the Freudian mysteries of the unconscious; in particular the secrets repressed by memory. In uncovering the truth about his father the young man begins to lose his own sense of identity. Bertolucci creates a claustrophobic, menacing atmosphere that reflects the confusion of his young hero.

Dumbo is the story of a baby circus animal born with oversized ears. Snubbed and ridiculed by all the other circus animals, he is befriended by Timothy, a small but spirited mouse. After Dumbo is involved in several disastrous performances under the big top, Timothy decides to launch Dumbo as a new star - the world&#8217;s only flying elephant. Also included in this program are three Disney cartoons: &#8220;Father Noah&#8217;s ark&#8221;, &#8220;The Practical pig&#8221;, and &#8220;Three orphan kittens&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Self-respect", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-respect", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 833338, "name": "Walt Disney", "creator_id": 68785, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 833339, "name": "Ben Sharpsteen", "creator_id": 60443, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "57565", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1945", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1945"}], "labels": [38815], "external_references": []}, {"id": 70916, "acmi_id": "007633", "title": "Duke of Wellington", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "duke-of-wellington", "creator_credit": "Clifford Parris, Frank Stevens and Film House Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;London No 1&#8221;.<br />\nA visit to Apsley House at Hyde Park Corner in London which belonged to the first Duke of Wellington and houses the Wellington Museum.

Strickland views herself as an architect and an artist - &#8220;fashioning places and experiences that have a purpose&#8221;. The focus of her work, &#8220;Portable effects&#8221; is about the architectural design, and the many dimensions of architectural space that are not particularly well suited to a linear or narrative structure. She discusses the relationship between her work and cinema, and excerpts are played of everyday nomads such as Thelma Gehry, explaining why they have chosen to carry certain objects in their hand luggage.<br />\nShe then moves on to describe how relationships were established between the 100 portable portraits to construct an interactive experience on CDROM, as well as briefly outlining interface design and database structure.

Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne.

Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>In Reel 11, we see the Queen dedicating the forecourt and eternal flame additions to Melbourne&#8217;s Shrine of Remembrance. The Queen and other audience are seen arriving at Melbourne&#8217;s Princess Theatre. The Duke visits the Flinders Naval Depot (now HMAS Cerberus).</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 11:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Shrine of Remembrance Dedication of Additions&#8221;, followed by aerial shots of Shrine of Remembrance with waiting crowds, and Queen&#8217;s car driving along St. Kilda Road. 00:00:35:00 car arrives at the Shrine, driving slowly through waving crowds. 00:00:41:00 Queen and Duke exit their car and are greeted (by an official party including Governor Brooks). 00:01:00:00 the party walk across the Shrine forecourt with Government House and Melbourne Observatory buildings visible in the background. Party climb steps and enter Shrine; at 00:01:34:00 an entertaining shot of a collective bow and curtsey at top of Shrine steps. The National Anthem is played and speeches made (NOTE: this footage does NOT include footage of Queen lighting Eternal Flame contained in Reel 1). There is a break in the film before a shot of the Eternal Flame smoking. Official party walk down steps and across the forecourt to the Eternal Flame. 00:03:18:00 Queen and Duke re-enter car and leave. 00:03:38:0 Title &#8220;Arrival at Princess Theatre Monday, 1st. March, 1954.&#8221;, followed by shots of Queen, Duke and other guests arriving at the Spring Street theatre in evening dress. 00:04:09:00 to 00:04:26:00 interior shots of the theatre (dress circle) and audience. 00:04:26:00 Title &#8220;Visit of His Royal Highness to Flinders Naval Depot Tuesday, 2nd. March, 1954.&#8221;, followed by train arriving (presumably at Flinders Naval Depot railway platform). 00:04:54:00 Duke exits train accompanied by William (Billy) McMahon (then Minister for Labour and National Service, later Prime Minister of Australia 1971-72) and is greeted by navy officers. Duke enters car and motorcade drives through streets lined with flag-waving children. 00:05:40:0 naval marching band and sailors on parade. Duke reviews troops, a short religious service is held, and the Duke makes a speech. 00:07:30:00 Band plays (probably Royal Australian Navy Band or Flinders Naval Depot Band). Sailors parade past saluting Duke.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Royal Visit, Victoria, 1954: Pre-Release Footage: Reel 11]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>State Film Centre of Victoria</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1954</p>", "description": "<p>The 1954 visit to Australia of newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria.

Ludovic throws his parents life into turmoil as he dresses up in girl&#8217;s clothing, plays with make-up and plans to marry the boy next door. Ludovic&#8217;s parents and their peers react with alarm at Ludovic&#8217;s pronouncements but Ludovic himself is a very together child. Director and screenwriter Alain Berliner presents &#8220;Ma vie en rose&#8221; as a modern fable, replete with scenes of magic realism and flights of fancy. The difficulties faced by Ludovic&#8217;s sexuality are presented as mostly challenges for the parents rather than the child. The perspective of the film is mostly Ludovic&#8217;s - which makes for an engaging comedy/drama, as Ludo is such a warm and heartfelt character. A film about family, acceptance, and sexual orientation, this was Alain Berliner&#8217;s debut feature.

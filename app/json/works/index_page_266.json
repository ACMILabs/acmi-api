Like many recent films from Iran, this one has a simple plot line, light humour, a humanitarian streak, and resonance due to its use of metaphor and rather complex themes. The film starts with concerned neighbours signing a petition for social workers to investigate a home where their blind mother and out-of-work father have locked up two girls for eleven years. Social workers &#8220;rescue&#8221; the (now severely intellectually and socially stunted) girls then give them back to their parents. What follows is an initiation period in which a social worker and the father have a seriocomic encounter whereby he gets a kind of comeuppance and the girls venture into the neighbourhood and begin to make friends despite their lack of social skills. What&#8217;s most harrowing about the film is that it&#8217;s based on a real life event and the principal characters play themselves, and it&#8217;s directed by an 18 year-old Iranian woman. Samira Makhmalbaf was able to shoot this film with film stock left over from her father&#8217;s (Mohsen Makhmalbaf) film &#8220;Sokhout&#8221; (1998). In Farsi with English subtitles. Cast includes Ghorban Ali Naderi, Azizeh Mohamadi, Massoumeh Naderi, Zahra Naderi and Zahra Saghrisaz.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Apple</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Iraj Sarbaz, Makhmalbaf Productions, MK2 Productions, Hubert Bals Fund and Samira Makhmalbaf</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Iran, Islamic Republic of, 1997</p>", "description": "<p>Two girls locked in the home for eleven years finally get a chance to go out and play.

Rated R, for reasons which become very apparent from the first five seconds.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mateship", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Australian football"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427586, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43588", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 2000", "notes": "release (via NFSA)", "to_year": "c. 2000"}], "labels": [26654], "external_references": []}, {"id": 86878, "acmi_id": "308590", "title": "The Little ark", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-little-ark", "creator_credit": "James B.

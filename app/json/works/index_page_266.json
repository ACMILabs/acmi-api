While Kitano&#8217;s deadpan comic character with a tendency to extreme and sudden violence is familiar from his earlier work, &#8216;Kikujiro&#8217; marks a departure from the milieu of the criminal underworld to focus on the unlikely bond that gradually develops between the man and boy. The film evokes Chaplin&#8217;s &#8216;The Kid&#8217;, both in Kitano&#8217;s trademark use of visual gags and in its sentimental bittersweet tone. In Japanese with English subtitles. Cast includes Takeshi Kitano, Yusuke Sekiguchi and Kayoko Kishimoto.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children and adults", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children of divorced parents", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1994966, "name": "Takeshi Kitano", "creator_id": 7712, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q26372", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994965, "name": "Takio Yoshida", "creator_id": 78822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994964, "name": "Masayuki Mori", "creator_id": 78820, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q302456", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994963, "name": "Nippon Herald Films", "creator_id": 32482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994962, "name": "Bandai Visual Company", "creator_id": 30358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994961, "name": "Office Kitano", "creator_id": 30312, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48055", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [30269], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90755, "acmi_id": "313765", "title": "The Love letter", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-love-letter", "creator_credit": "Peter Ho-sun Chan, Kate Capshaw, Midge Sanford, Sarah Pillsbury and NBCUniversal", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The lives of residents of Loblolly by the Sea are transformed by the discovery of a passionate love letter, written to and from a nameless person.

When Robert postpones the wedding to go and save a group of orphans stranded in the centre of a war zone, Megan demonstrates her devotion by accompanying him on his mission. After the last of the orphans are despatched to safety, Megan becomes separated from Robert, and is overcome by the panic-stricken crowds. She awakens to find herself on a military train, travelling to the Summer Palace of Chinese warlord General Yen (Nils Asther). Initially she is repulsed and frightened by both her alien surroundings and the Generals&#8217; attempts to win her favour, and demands to be sent back to Shanghai. General Yen, however, finds himself fascinated by Megan&#8217;s feisty nature, and finds excuses not to send her back to her fiancee. Any chance of a relationship developing between the two is irrevocably destroyed when Yen&#8217;s mistress Mah-li (Toshia Mora) betrays both him and Megan, initiating a sequence of events which result in the downfall of the mighty General. Originally Columbia Pictures assigned this film to silent film director Herbert Brenon, with Frank Capra lobbying for and eventually winning the project after Brenon left the studio due to creative and financial differences. Controversial due to its principle theme of interracial romance, this moody, sensual production deviated from Capra&#8217;s usual filmic concerns with its touching yet dramatic depiction of doomed love, a factor which Capra allegedly hoped would earn him an Academy Award. The characterisation of the Chinese in this film seems quite racist by today&#8217;s standards, especially the casting of Swedish silent film star Nils Asther, in the title role, plus a fantasy sequence where a demonic General Yen menaces Megan in her bedroom.

When Robert postpones the wedding to go and save a group of orphans stranded in the centre of a war zone, Megan demonstrates her devotion by accompanying him on his mission. After the last of the orphans are despatched to safety, Megan becomes separated from Robert, and is overcome by the panic-stricken crowds. She awakens to find herself on a military train, travelling to the Summer Palace of Chinese warlord General Yen (Nils Asther).

General Yen, however, finds himself fascinated by Megan&#8217;s feisty nature, and finds excuses not to send her back to her fiancee.

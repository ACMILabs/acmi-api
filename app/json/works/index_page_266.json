Political, passionate and dedicated feminist, folksinger (with a raw edge) Ani DiFranco, along with her band Righteous Babe, provides an insight into her music and her mind through this independently made documentary film. Spanning back from 1997 through to 2001 the film follows Ani and her entourage as they criss-cross the US performing live concerts to a devoted following every where they go. Includes on-stage footage from New Orleans, Buffalo NY, Austin, Knoxville, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, New Haven, Columbia interspersed with frank and upfront interviews with Ani and an inside look at how the band operates during these performances. Two of Ani&#8217;s passions are also explored here - feminism and her fight against the death penalty - and includes guest appearances by Utah Phillips, Hamell on Trial, Palmer Singleton (Defense Attorney, Southern Center for Human Rights), Sekou Sundiata, Bitch and Animal, Erin McKeown. Ani is magnetic. Her voice, energy and commitment to her art form uncompromising - 12 studio albums, including two collaborations with Utah Phillips have been released since the beginning of Righteous Babe Records in the early 90s. A great documentary for those into independent music.

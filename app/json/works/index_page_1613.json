Given no respect from his overbearing relatives including a picky mother-in-law, lazy brother-in-law and his bossy and nagging wife, Ambrose has a constant battle as everything seeming to be against him. His saving only grace is his daughter from a previous marriage and the workplace where he has a mild respect for his amazing memory. What happens when he wants to have an afternoon off to see a wrestling match is a series of mishaps where he finds himself out of a job and exiled by his family. This comedy of errors is an entertaining display of the art of Fields as a comedian. &#8220;The Man on the Flying Trapeze&#8221; is made up of a collection of short gags, almost short films in themselves, which make up the whole compelling feature. It is a fine farce of married life, in-laws and dysfunctional relationships where nothing ever goes right but is always funny. Cast also includes Mary Brian, Kathleen Howard and Lucien Littlefield.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884585, "name": "William Le Baron", "creator_id": 25609, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884586, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884587, "name": "Clyde Bruckman", "creator_id": 20813, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 884584, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52781", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1935", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1935"}], "labels": [34247]}, {"id": 88661, "acmi_id": "311257", "title": "The Man of fashion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-man-of-fashion", "creator_credit": "Crown Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1951", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1951-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;This Is Britain&#8221;.<br />\nDiscusses, in humorous fashion, the evolution of men&#8217;s clothes, showing how details of dress have evolved over the years.

The subtlest of his films, &#8220;Cookie&#8217;s Fortune&#8221; focuses on a small American town to juxtapose the &#8216;old racist South&#8217; with the &#8216;new South&#8217; in which interracial relationships and carefree attitudes have replaced the repression and stoicism of the past. Though there is a hint of narrative suspense, &#8220;Cookie&#8217;s Fortune&#8221; proceeds with a higher purpose: taking a relaxed, meandering pace to trace out the moral dimensions of its milieu, and the potential for art to encourage pretension and superficiality while affirming that the joy of life is offered to those who embrace it by way of being earthly, honest, good-natured and spirited.

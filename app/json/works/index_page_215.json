But what he miscalculates is Trevor&#8217;s unique psychological makeup: not only is he completely anti-society, the more society attempts to strap him down, the more his anger is fuelled. Perhaps the most terrifying aspect of Clarke&#8217;s portrait of young Trevor is that his neo-Nazism is in fact a logical extension of Britain&#8217;s colonial history: hence Trevor could only be &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221;. A tight script by David Leland, an outstanding performance by Tim Roth and tight, precise editing makes this film an unforgettable viewing experience.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Racism in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Immigrants - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fascism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Juvenile corrections", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Juvenile delinquency", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Juvenile delinquents", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National socialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social structure - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social work with juvenile delinquents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Anger", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Anger"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996982, "name": "Alan Clarke", "creator_id": 33527, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996981, "name": "Margaret Matheson", "creator_id": 34716, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996980, "name": "Central Independent Television (UK)", "creator_id": 20644, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50575", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [32561], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93057, "acmi_id": "316417", "title": "Angels with dirty faces", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "angels-with-dirty-faces", "creator_credit": "Michael Curtiz and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1938", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1938-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Despite his success in musicals and comedies throughout his career, James Cagney will be remembered best for his tough guys roles in &#8220;White heat&#8221;, &#8220;Public enemy&#8221; and &#8220;Angels with dirty faces&#8221;.

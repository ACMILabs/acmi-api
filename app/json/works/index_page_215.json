Things begin to fall apart when Joe is pulled back into the world of drugs and crime in order to save his friend, Liam (David McKay), whose life is at stake when he can&#8217;t pay back the local drug lords for his partner&#8217;s heroin addiction. Sarah&#8217;s disapproval of the underworld and Joe&#8217;s connections to it pushes their relationship to breaking point and Joe to the very edge. Loach&#8217;s film combines a razor-sharp portrayal of unemployed and working-class life in Glasgow with strong doses of melodrama. Clearly &#8216;leftist&#8217; in his concerns, Loach reveals the limited options available to those living in a world dominated by a closed circuit of unemployment, substance abuse and crime. The possibility of breaking free of this circuit lies in the character, Joe, whose redemption however comes at a high price. In a manner reminiscent of Nicholas Ray, Loach dramatises the intense rhapsody and sheer desperation of gaining and losing a sense of humanity. &#8220;My Name is Joe&#8221; is both poignant melodrama and stirring political realism. Music by George Fenton.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Glasgow (Scotland)", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Places&nbsp;→ Glasgow (Scotland)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996665, "name": "Ken Loach", "creator_id": 72757, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55238", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996664, "name": "Rebecca O'Brien", "creator_id": 28484, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2134946", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996663, "name": "Road Movies Vierte Produktionen", "creator_id": 34444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996662, "name": "Parallax Pictures", "creator_id": 20477, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996661, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50297", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [32280], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92789, "acmi_id": "316118", "title": "Three colours blue = Trois couleurs bleu [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "three-colours-blue-trois-couleurs-bleu-dvd", "creator_credit": "Krzysztof Kieslowski, Marin Karmitz, Canal+, TOR Film Studio, CAB, France 3 Cinema, CED and MK2 Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1993", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1993-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Three colours blue is the first installment in Krzysztof Kieslowski&#8217;s trilogy based on the three ideals of the French revolution - liberty, equality and fraternity.

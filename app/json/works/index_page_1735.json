Tokyo Story is actually a recasting of Leo McCarey&#8217;s Make Way For Tomorrow which his collaborator, Noda, had seen but Ozu had not. As in most of his later films there is a pervasive nostalgia, a sense of loss. Although a loosely plotted leisurely survey of the extended family structured around journeys, the film is full of conflicts triggered by the grandparents&#8217; visit in which characterisation both enriches and qualifies stark thematic oppositions. The generally sombre tone and lack of formal playfulness is reminiscent of &#8216;There Was a Father&#8217;.

But the young children who they see, largely orphaned and living in extreme poverty and hardship, are too busy working as smugglers to be convinced about the worth of education. Filmed in the rugged mountainous terrain of Kurdistan, &#8220;Blackboards&#8221; uses the most economic means of mise-en-scene and editing to create a powerful evocation of the terror of war. The bonds between men and women - marriage, family - and the sanctity of childhood are all shown as precarious in a context where chemical bombs and machine guns can destroy a whole community. As the teachers join the increasing load of refugees fleeing across the wild savage borders, we are confronted with one of cinema&#8217;s most moving expressions of the madness and evil of war.

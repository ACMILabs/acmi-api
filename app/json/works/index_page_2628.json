Nineteen year-old Boni finds release from his ennui with erotic writings - obsessive detailed accounts of his desires for a married woman. Boni is perturbed by the arrival of his little sister, Nenette, a teenager who is pregnant and in need of his support. Nenette and Boni have been estranged since the divorce of their parents, having lived separately for many years, and their reunion is fraught and even violent, filtered through the pain of their parents&#8217; relationship. As the pregnancy continues Boni becomes increasingly engaged by the idea of the baby, whilst Nenette remains hostile to the idea of motherhood.

Nelly is struggling with their financial situation, juggling several odd jobs to make ends meet. One day she meets by chance at a restaurant, Mr Arnaud. He is an elderly, retired judge, reasonably well off and estranged from his wife and children. Arnaud, a complete stranger, offers to pay her debts, no strings attached, and Nelly reluctantly agrees. Intrigued by Nelly, Arnaud employs her to help him record his memoirs. Nelly is depicted as a somewhat aloof woman searching for a connection to those around her. Mr Arnaud is a man near the end of his life, financially secure but dwelling on past regrets, both personal and professional. The bond between them intensifies and as Nelly embarks on an affair with a dashing young publisher, Vincent (Jean-Hugues Anglade), Nelly and Arnoud&#8217;s relationship is threatened. Created from an original script, &#8220;Nelly and Mr Arnaud&#8221; is a gently observed tale about friendship and the vagaries of the heart. This was the last film directed by Claude Sautet before his death. In French with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Foreign language films", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 811555, "name": "Les Films Alain Sarde", "creator_id": 30241, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811556, "name": "TF1 Films productions", "creator_id": 23587, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811557, "name": "Cecchi Gori Group Tiger Cinamatografica", "creator_id": 27166, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811558, "name": "Alain Sarde", "creator_id": 23743, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811559, "name": "Claude Sautet", "creator_id": 27274, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49953", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [31969], "external_references": [{"id": 2009, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1930843"}]}, {"id": 78084, "acmi_id": "016542", "title": "Nelli Kim", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "nelli-kim", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Jacques Bobet and Georges Dufaux", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Member of the Soviet Union&#8217;s women&#8217;s gymnastic team at the 1976 Olympic Games, Nelli Kim was 17 when she won two gold medals for her superb performance on the horse vault and for the floor exercises.

Powell saw it not as a horror film but &#8216;a film of compassion, of observation and of memory &#8230; a film about the cinema from 1900 to 1960 &#8230; the opposite to a realistic film &#8230; a reverie&#8217;. A withdrawn psychopath, traumatised by childhood memories, films young women as he impales them with the camera&#8217;s tripod, forcing them to watch their own death throes in a mirror mounted on the camera. This is rendered genuinely disturbing as we are drawn into identification with the protagonist through Carl Boehm&#8217;s subtly controlled performance. Littered with internal cross references, this is a reflexively subversive film about the fascination of cinema, a film which seeks to make voyeurs of us all.

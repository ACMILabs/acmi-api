It became evident from his work over the following years that the incidence of cancer and leukemia was much higher there than in other areas. The film covers exposure to atomic fallout by civilians around the government&#8217;s Nevada site in the 1950&#8217;s and early 60&#8217;s and the soldiers who were participants in the nuclear bomb tests.

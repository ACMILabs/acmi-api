This became one of pop culture&#8217;s most discussed questions when this pilot for David Lynch&#8217;s &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; was first aired on television. Kyle MacLachlan plays FBI agent Dale Cooper who comes into the sleepy small-town Twin Peaks to investigate Laura Palmer&#8217;s murder and discovers that underneath the banal facade the town hides a labyrinth of perversity and evil. As with &#8220;Eraserhead&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Velvet&#8221;, Lynch uses macabre humour to expose the psychological neurosis and psychosis that underlie the supposed normality of middle-class America. Both wickedly funny and savagely shocking, &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; radicalised the potential of the TV mini-series by introducing generic forms and psychological content that had previously been isolated to independent cinema. Ep 1: An autopsy reveals a few unexpected clues relating to Laura&#8217;s actions on the night of her murder. Laura&#8217;s secret lover James Hurley, is released from custody. Ep 2: Agent Cooper turns to unconventional criminology methods, lecturing the local Sheriff&#8217;s office on the wisdom of Tibet. Several important plot threads are also revealed in this episode, while a new and uneasy friendship forms between the sultry and spoilt Audrey Horne and Laura&#8217;s best friend, Donna Hayward. This episode, directed by Lynch himself, ends with the much discussed surreal dream sequence where Agent Cooper encounters strange figures such as the One-Armed Man, the Magician, the dancing Man from Another Place and Laura Palmer herself. Ep 3: This episode begins the morning after Agent Cooper&#8217;s dream in which Laura Palmer revealed to him the killer&#8217;s name. Unfortunately, Agent Cooper has forgotten, and he and Sheriff Truman must continue the investigation with FBI forensic expert, Albert Rosenfeld&#8217;s assistance. Meanwhile, the town readies itself for Laura&#8217;s funeral and deals with the arrival of Madeline Ferguson, Laura&#8217;s dark-haired but otherwise identical cousin. Ep 4: Agent Cooper&#8217;s dream visions begin to materialise in this episode as Sarah Palmer, Laura&#8217;s mother, has a vision of the evil man named Bob, and Deputy Hawke has located the One-Armed Man. Laura&#8217;s classmate, Audrey Horne, has also been looking for clues as she begins to suspect that her father may have some involvement in Laura&#8217;s murder. &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; is a soap opera and police drama as reinterpreted by the leading urrealist of contemporary cinema.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Twin Peaks.

His friends, a mix of rappers, dancers and turntablists, yearn to stage a huge hip-hop concert and give voice to their artistic expression. On the cusp of adulthood, the teenagers face all manner of trials, including fledging romances and the stigma of their class, as they face the future. Despite its dated aesthetic, &#8220;Beat Street&#8221; is a lot of fun, and quite exuberant as it travels from one snappy musical moment to the next. This film is also an interesting view of the Bronx as it existed in the 1980s - a fascinating melting pot of backgrounds, set against the grimy subways, graffiti work, and an underground music and dance scene. Cast includes: Rae Dawn Chong, Guy Davis, John Chardiet, Leon Grant and Robert Taylor. Kool Herc, Kool Moe Dee, The Rock Steady and NY Breakers, Us Girls, Busy Bee, Melle Mel and the Furious Five, Bambaataa &amp; Soul Sonic Force, Tina B., Brenda Starr, Treacherous Three and Doug E. Fresh are among the artists that make an appearance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African American women", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Graffiti", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African American women", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hip-hop - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ African American women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "History&nbsp;→ African American women", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop - New York (State) - New York", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Musicals", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/beat-street", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2109140, "name": "Stan Lathan", "creator_id": 17596, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2109138, "name": "Harry Belafonte", "creator_id": 80832, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q214959", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2109136, "name": "David V.

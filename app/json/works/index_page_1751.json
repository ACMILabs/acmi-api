A withdrawn psychopath, traumatised by childhood memories, films young women as he impales them with the camera&#8217;s tripod, forcing them to watch their own death throes in a mirror mounted on the camera. This is rendered genuinely disturbing as we are drawn into identification with the protagonist through Carl Boehm&#8217;s subtly controlled performance. Littered with internal cross references, this is a reflexively subversive film about the fascination of cinema, a film which seeks to make voyeurs of us all. Cast also includes Moira Shearer, Anna Massey and Maxine Audley.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Child psychology", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Voyeurism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology, Pathological", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Voyeurism", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 100}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 805207, "name": "Michael Powell", "creator_id": 21924, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55234", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 805206, "name": "Michael Powell (Theatre) Ltd", "creator_id": 32119, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47630", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1959", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1959"}], "labels": [793]}, {"id": 97905, "acmi_id": "507217", "title": "Bertolucci shoots 1900", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bertolucci-shoots-1900", "creator_credit": "Gianni Amelio, Luca Olmastroni and Daria Cinematografica", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1975", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A documentary made during the shooting of Bertolucci&#8217;s &#8220;Novocento&#8221; which includes comments by Bertolucci on his attitudes to film-making as well as reflecting the particular style of this film-maker.

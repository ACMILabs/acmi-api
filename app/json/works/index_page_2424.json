Complications ensue when the couple visit a campground named The Red Squirrel and Lisa&#8217;s memory starts to return, as does her ex-husband. At the campground Lisa and Jota encounter a myriad of characters, who compound the sense of deception and duplicity that pervades the film. Directed with humour and flair by Julio Medem, &#8220;The Red squirrel&#8221; has much in common with Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;Vertigo&#8221; in that is explores the territory of a man shaping his ideal woman out of a person he (wrongly) perceives to be an empty vessel. At times &#8220;The Red squirrel&#8221; mocks the idea of machismo; in particular Jota&#8217;s rock star posturing and the chauvinistic overtures of an obnoxious male neighbour at the camp. The game within the game is what drives the narrative and keeps the audience guessing as to who is telling, or even knows, the truth.

Deirdre, a mysterious Irish woman, organises a crack team for one high-risk job - to steal a valuable case of unknown contents. The team consists of an ex-CIA officer, a former European intelligence officer, a skilled driver, a top electronics expert and a weapons specialist. The five don&#8217;t know, like or particularly trust one another but must work together to get the job done. Director Frankenheimer, somewhat of an expert in the field of car chase sequences, flexes his knowledge here with spectacular rides through the narrow streets of Paris and Cannes. Pyrotechnics, rolling cars, shootouts and a minor love interest make &#8220;Ronin&#8221; a fairly standard crime movie with some very impressive stunts. International cast includes: Robert De Niro, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgard, Jonathon Pryce and Jean Reno. Script is by David Mamet (The Winslow boy, Hannibal, State and Main) working under the pseudonym Richard Weisz.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Norwegian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Paris (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962718, "name": "John Frankenheimer", "creator_id": 23513, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962717, "name": "John Frankenheimer", "creator_id": 23513, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962716, "name": "Frank Mancuso", "creator_id": 33024, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962715, "name": "Frank Mancuso", "creator_id": 33024, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962714, "name": "FGM Entertainment", "creator_id": 33023, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962712, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962713, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20044, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/cErYSa1xjPBvjf0yCB26oWaOEYp.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Ronin  (John Frankenheimer) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51225", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33110]}, {"id": 72340, "acmi_id": "28042", "title": "Ron Shelley: civil engineer", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ron-shelley-civil-engineer", "creator_credit": "Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1968", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Typical experiences of a design engineer working on road and bridge construction in Papua-New Guinea, illustrating the development role of better communications.

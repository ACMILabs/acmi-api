Unfortunately her mother is competing for the same part. The situation becomes intolerable when Nancy follows her mother to Rio in order to wrest the part off her; complications ensue when both women fall for the same man. A featherweight musical filmed in Technicolor, &#8216;Nancy Goes to Rio&#8217; is mostly remembered for being Carmen Miranda&#8217;s second to last picture. The film is essentially a remake of &#8216;It&#8217;s A Date&#8217;, Universal, 1940.

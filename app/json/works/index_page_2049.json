Feng Lan is from an upper-middle class family, she is one of two children and her father is a wealthy, educated official; whereas, Zhang-Min is from a poor working class family of seven, where Zhang Min is the sole provider.

The Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong took socialist realism as its basis for art, making clear its goal was the &#8220;education&#8221; of the people in communist ideology. This included, as during the Cultural Revolution, transforming literature and art to serve these ends. Despite the fact that the Communist Party was restructured in post-Mao China, Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s new version of &#8220;Socialism with Chinese characteristics&#8221; is very much rooted in the homogeneity and control of its people through the arts (this is often noticeable in the Chinese films made during the 1970s and early 1980s). Though benign, the ideological propaganda that the film employs is difficult to ignore. Feng Lan embodies the figure of the virtuous woman that the Chinese female should strive to become. The family is run like socialist unit, where each member has a distinct role and complementing personalities. Harmony and efficiency was only achieved when they embraced Feng Lan as the matriarch.

By producing films, such as Orchid Road, with a deep emphasis on the importance of high morals and virtues, they are seen as contributing to the greater cause of promoting the socialist cause.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nPropaganda can be linked back to the PRC&#8217;s scientific and educational policies. Anne-Marie Brady, an Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury&#8217;s School of Political Science and Communication, writes that propaganda and thought work have become the &#8220;life blood&#8221; of the Party-State since the post-1989 period, and one of the key means for guaranteeing the CCP&#8217;s continued legitimacy and hold on power. The Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong took socialist realism as its basis for art, making clear its goal was the &#8220;education&#8221; of the people in communist ideology. This included, as during the Cultural Revolution, transforming literature and art to serve these ends. Despite the fact that the Communist Party was restructured in post-Mao China, Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s new version of &#8220;Socialism with Chinese characteristics&#8221; is very much rooted in the homogeneity and control of its people through the arts (this is often noticeable in the Chinese films made during the 1970s and early 1980s). Though benign, the ideological propaganda that the film employs is difficult to ignore. Feng Lan embodies the figure of the virtuous woman that the Chinese female should strive to become. The family is run like socialist unit, where each member has a distinct role and complementing personalities. Harmony and efficiency was only achieved when they embraced Feng Lan as the matriarch. More telling are some of the lines that Feng Lan delivers, in one scene she explains to Zhang-Qi (the youngest female of the family who is depicted as a shallow and superficial character whose sole interest is following fashion trends):<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s not just money that brings happiness, it is work and noble spirit…one should not be the slave of money.&#8221;<br />\nThe film is very culturally specific, foreign audiences might find the narrative, with its soap operatic melodrama, outdated and disengaging.<br />\n(2.5 stars - Mary Chen; May 22, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890136, "name": "Jichang Li", "creator_id": 82791, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890133, "name": "Wei Kou", "creator_id": 82788, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890132, "name": "Liaoning Scientific and Educational Film Studio of the PRC", "creator_id": 82787, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 890140, "name": "Ruying Tu", "creator_id": 82795, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890139, "name": "Qinghong Liu", "creator_id": 82794, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890138, "name": "Ge Xu", "creator_id": 82793, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890137, "name": "Maya Chen", "creator_id": 82792, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890135, "name": "Xingyuan Geng", "creator_id": 82790, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890134, "name": "Chonghu Tao", "creator_id": 82789, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146469", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [55315]}]}

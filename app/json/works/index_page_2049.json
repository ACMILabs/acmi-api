How about the high-octane car race the Templestowe Hill Climb, which snaked through 960 metres of outer suburb scrub?</p>\n<p>Thanks to Kenneth’s granddaughter, who donated his films to our collection in August 2016, we can peer back into Melbourne’s past, sharing everyday and extraordinary experiences.</p>\n<p>Comprising 38 cans of silent, colour 16mm films, Kenneth’s collection portrays gardens, regional and interstate holidays, beauty pageants, shipping ports, water skiing and royal visits, many of the films introduced by his custom-made title, “KenRa Films Present”. No surprise for a celluloid enthusiast who had a movie studio behind his Caulfield home.</p>\n<p>Kenneth even came third in a Western Australian amateur film competition for Every Many Should Have A Hobby, a fictional narrative of a man pursuing his secret filmmaking passion. The film is currently undergoing conservation treatment due to acetate deterioration, but we’re hoping to get it digitised like the wonderful home movies in this collection.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["Approx running time 5.2 hours (11,380ft)"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2508727, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119632, "acmi_id": "B2003371", "title": "Hubby gets a Hobby", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hubby-gets-a-hobby", "creator_credit": "Keith Greenwood and Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1947", "video_links": [{"id": 1602, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/rwbGtX1eN8g"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1947-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

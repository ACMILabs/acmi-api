A young, staunchly anti-authoritarian outsider (Kevin Dillon) leads the charge, joined by cheerleader Meg (Shawnee Smith). When local authorities struggle in vain to contain the threat, mysterious government agents arrive to take the situation in hand, trying to cover up the evidence under suspicious circumstances. The overfamiliar machinations of the narrative are compensated for by state-of-the-art special effects (revelling in true gore here, the visuals leave little to the imagination) and the numerous scary moments that ensue. Cast includes Donovan Leitch, Jeffrey DeMunn, Candy Clark and Joe Seneca.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture remakes", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Extraterrestrial beings", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Life on other planets", "Motion picture remakes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924476, "name": "Tri-Star Pictures", "creator_id": 22768, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924477, "name": "Jack H.

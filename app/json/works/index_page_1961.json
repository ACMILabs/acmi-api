Concini hopes to use power and influence to overthrow the young king but his plan is violently opposed by the peers of the Kingdom who have their own candidate to the succession, Charles d&#8217;Angouleme. As Concini terrorises his opponents, the kingdom is on the verge of a civil war. In order to save his life and his throne, the young king enlists the help of Francois, also known as Le Capitan, the best swashbuckler of the kingdom, and his sidekick, Cogolin.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Paul Cadeac, Pierre Caband, Rene Bezard ; director, Andre Hunebelle ; writers, Jean Halain, Pierre Foucaud, Andre Hunebelle ; photography, Marcel Grignon ; music, Jean Marion.<br />\nCast: Pierrette Bruno, Lise Delamare, Annie Anderson, Guy Delorme, Jean Marais.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2560694, "name": "Andre Hunebelle", "creator_id": 83002, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q518179", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560691, "name": "Paul Cadeac", "creator_id": 83001, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121057852", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560692, "name": "Pierre Caband", "creator_id": 83117, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3385047", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2560693, "name": "Rene Bezard", "creator_id": 83118, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121336977", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146781", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [55551]}]}

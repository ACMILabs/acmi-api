The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family.

The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA).

Yehia is an eighteen-year-old boy living with extended family in Alexandria. His parents, in particular his father, have made great personal sacrifices in order to send their son to expensive schools, in order that he may become an engineer. But Yehia fosters desires and ambitions to be an actor in Hollywood. Despite Yehia&#8217;s evident commitment, his father dismisses his son&#8217;s art as a serious prospect. However as Hitler&#8217;s troops advance toward Egypt, the life that Yehia and his family are accustomed to starts to crumble. Thousands flee, becoming refugees, and as prices inflate ordinary people struggle to cope with wartime rationing. Meanwhile - a group of men, disgruntled by English occupation dispatch various plots, in the hope of assassinating Churchill; a beautiful Jewess falls in love with one would-be-assassin, but her wealthy father wishes them to flee the Nazi threat; a young gay English soldier, terrified of his imminent dispatch to the Front, has an affair with a charming aristocrat. Chahine cleverly intersperses newsreel footage with the lives of his protagonists as they struggle to determine their prospects, whilst also interrogating notions of patriotism and duty versus desire and personal ambition. This autobiographical film was followed by two sequels, &#8220;Alexandria again and forever&#8221; and &#8220;An Egyptian story&#8221;.

Simultaneously Yehia (played by the director himself) finds himself attracted to two actors - the handsome young Amr, who Yehia works with on laboured productions, and Nadia, with whom he hopes to collaborate. Following on from the themes explored in &#8220;An Egyptian story&#8221;, Yahia heartlessly forfeits his personal relationships in favour of his work. Yahine&#8217;s struggle to reconcile his art with his ambitions and personal failings is set against Egypt&#8217;s divisive drive, in the 1980s, toward democratic reform. The film takes on a surreal flavour with several musical interludes (one delightfully recalling &#8220;Singin&#8217; in the rain&#8221; as Yehia and Amr celebrate winning the Silver Bear award at Berlin). Chahine applies his signature energy to the film - an appealing mix of whimsy, satire and barbed attacks on the political and social situation in his beloved homeland.

black and white episodes of the classic BBC series about a father and son team of Junk-merchants, and bastions of bad taste, written by Alan Simpson and Ray Galton.

In &#8220;Bath&#8221;, Harold invites a &#8216;bird&#8217; for cocktails and arrives home to find his Dad eating pickles in the bath in the middle of the lounge room. A bit of a social stigma, to say the least.

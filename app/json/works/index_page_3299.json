Filmed on location in Perugia and Cincecitta and directed by Liliana Cavani (The Night porter, Ripley&#8217;s game).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:09:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italy - Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Biographical", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Humanitarianism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Italy - Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Monasticism and religious orders", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Monks", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Persecution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Saints", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Spiritual healing", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ St. Francis of Assisi", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Theology", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Spiritual healing", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "History&nbsp;→ Italy - History", "History&nbsp;→ Monasticism and religious orders", "History&nbsp;→ Monks", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "History&nbsp;→ Saints", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Saints", "People&nbsp;→ St. Francis of Assisi", "Religious films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962049, "name": "Channel 1", "creator_id": 35036, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962050, "name": "Italnoleggio Cinematografica", "creator_id": 35037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962051, "name": "Karol Film", "creator_id": 35038, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962052, "name": "Radiotelevisione Italiana", "creator_id": 15142, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962053, "name": "Roberta Cadringher", "creator_id": 35039, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962054, "name": "Liliana Cavani", "creator_id": 24008, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50866", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [32823]}, {"id": 75987, "acmi_id": "013695", "title": "Francesca baby", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "francesca-baby", "creator_credit": "Martin Tahse Productions, Martin Tahse and Larry S.

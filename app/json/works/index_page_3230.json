His only recourse from the insistent noise and chaos of the New York streets is to power tool anyone that gets in his way. Ferrara&#8217;s films, full of spiritual torment and redemption through bloodletting have seen the director compared to fellow New Yorker Martin Scorsese. With &#8220;Driller killer&#8221; however, its spiritual doppelganger ends up being Roman Polanski&#8217;s disturbing tale of madness, &#8220;Repulsion.&#8221; There&#8217;s even a perverse homage to the skinned rabbit from that film.

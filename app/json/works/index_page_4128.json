Louis makes his way into the world and advances from gramophone salesman to owner of a huge, modern gramophone factory. When Emile is released, he joins is old cellmate at the plant. After things go wrong, they take to the road together as tramps. Clair has created a sublime musical comedy satire on the work ethics and the dehumanizing effects of mass-production techniques. The film inspired Chaplin&#8217;s &#8216;Modern times&#8217;, in which there are similar sequences on the assembly line. Danger in &#8216;A nous la liberte&#8217; often comes in the form of prophetic images of militaristic domination: the factory guards wear proto-fascist armbands and uniforms. The film equates authoritarianism with capitalist exploitation of the working class. Emile&#8217;s one time fellow prisoner, Louis becomes a wealthy industrialist and builds a factory modelled on the prison from which he once escaped. But Emile is the Dada remedy to Louis&#8217;s capitalist order. Everywhere he goes, straight lines collapse in confusion and mass production comes to a standstill.&#8221; Reference: Alan Williams. &#8216;Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking&#8217;.

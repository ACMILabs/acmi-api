The remaining ministers, however, remain stuck in severe traffic, causing them to be late to the meeting. The men complain about the daily morning congestion in Shanghai. The meeting at the mayor&#8217;s office commences. They watch a video showing the daily public transport and congestion issues of life in Shanghai. They discuss the amount of time citizens waste year after year commuting back and forth from work. Elderly residents are shown living in inconvenient high-rise apartments to avoid the risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jinghua fixes a wheelchair for his invalid aunty in the extreme heat while his mother looks after his young son. Aunt Chen is wheeled through the residential laneway where she lives on the wheelchair. Her son Baozhu is glad to see her out of the house.</p>\n<p>The mayor visits an inner city suburb to assess the situation. He finds the residents congested and overcrowded. An open-minded and caring man, he looks after the masses.</p>\n<p>A violent thunderstorm hits and the vulnerable housing areas are completely flooded. While residents try frantically to stop the water, the council meets to discuss how to halt the flooding. They discover that the flooding has occurred because the area&#8217;s drainage system has not been repaired for 34 years. Furious, the mayor promises he will lead an investigation to discover why the system has been neglected. Although it is too late to prevent the flooding, the Mayor promises to find a solution as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Tempers shorten as the residents try desperately to save their property. Several days pass, but the water refuses to subside. The council begins to panic. The Mayor fires Liu Shan, a female minister, believing her to be too young to effectively perform her role.</p>\n<p>Secretary Gao, an older member of the council, asks his daughter Gao Jie about her relationship with Mayor Zhang Yimin. She tells him that the Mayor is only interested in her so he can get closer to the government. He worries that Zhang visits her father more than he visits her.</p>\n<p>The council members help the masses fight the water in a brave display of camaraderie.</p>\n<p>A new housing plan begins construction with the Mayor in attendance. Residents whose houses were destroyed by the flood are given new housing by the council.

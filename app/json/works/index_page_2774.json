Music from Josef Bayer&#8217;s &#8220;Die Puppenfee&#8221;. &#8220;Spiritual constructions&#8221; (1927-29). Kaolin wax figures are modelled and manipulated on a glass sheet with lighting from beneath, rendering opaque shapes with fluid, continuous movement. &#8220;Study number 7&#8221; (1930-31). Various shapes, including dots, squares and lines, are gracefully and energetically transformed, flickering and curving across the screen, accompanied by Brahms&#8217; Hungarian Dance No 5. &#8220;Study number 8&#8221; (1931) Complex and stunning work, presaged Fantasia, with an array of shapes humorously flitting hither and thither. &#8220;Kreise = Circles&#8221; (1933) A commercial commissioned by the Tolirag Theatre, Fischinger presents a free-form composition made of circles which interlink, flash, fly and surge past the viewer. &#8220;Allegretto&#8221; (1936) Fischinger&#8217;s first American film is a splendidly colourful affair, accompanied by a jazz soundtrack. &#8220;Motion painting no 1&#8221; (1947) This piece is about the evolution of a painting, literally a work in motion, as swirls, shapes and lines are continuously layered, creating new patterns and forms. An influential artist, Fischinger&#8217;s work is both visually spectacular and humorous.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Special effects", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Germany", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.)", "Experimental", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Germany"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 820710, "name": "Oskar Fischinger", "creator_id": 36712, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52637", "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [34130]}]}

Watch this film and ask yourself: Do you feel lucky?</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Harry Callaghan is a tough, streetwise San Francisco cop whom they call Dirty Harry. In this classic film, you will see why. You will also see why Clint Eastwood&#8217;s reputation is secure. No other actor can match his presence. He is magnetising in his portrayal as the shoot-first-ask-questions-later law enforcer who must hunt a psychotic roof-top killer who has slain two people and has kidnapped a girl and threatens to suffocate her if his ransom demands are not met. Harry will get him&#8230; one way or the other&#8230; no matter what the &#8220;system&#8221; prescribes. Moody cinematography and stunning location filming propel the story and capitalise upon Eastwood&#8217;s commanding presence.

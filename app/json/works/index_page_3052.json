A flexible model simulating the human backbone is used to illustrate how discs are &#8220;pinched&#8221; when weights are lifted while the backbone is curved. Good posture, positioning, and smooth application of lifting power are shown. Demonstrations point out that using the powerful leg muscles with the back straight and vertical increases lifting power. Extremely heavy items can only be handled with a special lifting device.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:18:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industrial efficiency", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industrial equipment", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Lifting and carrying", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Manual labor", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Safety education, Industrial", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Occupational training", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Accidents - Prevention", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Health education", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Lifting and carrying", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 853408, "name": "Ruddell Films", "creator_id": 15872, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "24558", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [8413]}, {"id": 83150, "acmi_id": "304351", "title": "Industrial symphony no. 1: dream of the broken hearted", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "industrial-symphony-no-1-dream-of-the-broken-hearted", "creator_credit": "Elbow Music, David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1989", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Video of a performance featuring Julee Cruise singing the music of David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti.

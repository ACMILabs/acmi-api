From its fetishistic reconstruction of the code and conduct of organized crime, right down to its casual, flippant depictions of violence, &#8220;The Big hit&#8221; owes a lot to the films of Quentin Tarantino (which are in themselves pastiches of various European and American filmmakers). However the spectre of the Hong Kong action film hangs over them all (&#8220;The Big hit&#8221; goes as far as enlisting Hong Kong action director Che-Kirk Wong and the executive producer is the legendary John Woo), a cinema that is wonderfully inventive with its own form of genre splicing and indirect homage.

Donella.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This teen thriller, set in a small American port town named Cradle Bay, has echoes of the &#8220;Stepford wives&#8221;, albeit played out in a more baleful and graphic manner. In this deceptively banal location a science experiment is being conducted on errant students, each of whom are hand selected then essentially lobotomised, after which they start to behave like &#8216;perfect&#8217; students. After a family tragedy, the Clark family move from Chicago to Cradle Bay, and Steve, (a teenager struggling with a past tragedy), tries to comes to terms with the odd behaviours that he sees around him. Gavin and UV (two arch outsiders) implore Steve that danger abounds behind the seemingly A-grade students, the Blue Ribbons, whose violent outbursts belie their otherwise purist nature. Katie Holms plays Rachel, a rebel bad-girl who teams up with Steve to try to uncover the mystery and save future students from a sinister fate. David Nutter&#8217;s feature debut pays due attention to the tropes of the genre, providing requisite thrills and tensions, beatings and romantic interludes, all to a soft-core punk-rock soundtrack. Cast includes James Marsden, Nick Stahl, Steve Railsback, Bruce Greenwood, Bill Sadler and Chad E.

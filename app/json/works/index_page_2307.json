Immersed in an upper-class world of frippery, fine manners and nasty natures, various friends and associates gather for a weekend shooting party; when murder occurs, suspicious ulterior motives are revealed. But this narrative, largely related from the perspective of the servants, is less of a mystery than it is a comedy centering on the politics and mores of aristocratic society, the &#8216;upstairs&#8217; shenanigans of which are mirrored by the equally fascinating world of footmen, butlers, valets, maids and cooks, who vehemently adhere to the below stairs strictures. With labyrinthine systems of etiquette and appropriate behaviours, these &#8216;downstairs&#8217; caretakers are bland observers of their employers&#8217; lives, who thrive on gossip and rumour, feeding off lascivious details and intricacies, whilst observing the treachery and mixed fortunes of their masters&#8217; lives. Presenting over a score of well-defined players, it is a testament to Altman&#8217;s skill that none are mere ciphers, but rather sustain complex characterisations, creating a fascinating tableau of class politics, societal mores, perfidious interpersonal relationships and a cohesive panorama of human behaviour. Stellar cast includes: Eileen Atkins, Bob Balaban, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Richard E. Grant, Tom Hollander, Derek Jacobi, Kelly Macdonald, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, Ryan Phillippe, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson and James Wilby.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Manners and customs", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aristocracy (Social class)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Manners and customs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998779, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55163", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998776, "name": "Bob Balaban", "creator_id": 80201, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q621490", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998778, "name": "David Levy", "creator_id": 80629, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223137", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998777, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55163", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998772, "name": "Capitol Films", "creator_id": 29576, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5035871", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998773, "name": "Film Council", "creator_id": 35985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998775, "name": "Sandcastle 5 Productions", "creator_id": 35987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998774, "name": "Zestwick Limited", "creator_id": 35986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998771, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51943", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33583]}, {"id": 94076, "acmi_id": "317848", "title": "A Beautiful mind [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-beautiful-mind-dvd", "creator_credit": "Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment (US) and NBCUniversal", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45561, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q164103"}], "brief_description": "<p>Ron Howard won accolades (including several Academy Awards) for &#8220;A Beautiful mind&#8221; which navigates the story of real life Nobel Prize winning mathematician, John Nash.

Gu made extraordinary observations on the happenings of workers and passengers of Number 3 bus and realises that &#8220;quarrels&#8221; and issues often arise because workers&#8217; voices are strained when they work as station-callers; and their attitude and energy are used to its very last drop while they perform their monotonous roles with no respite every day.

When Gu finally tries to sit down to confess his love for Qing, he loses his courage and could only mumble gobbledygook.

At the time, Deng Xiaoping promoted the slogan &#8220;emancipation of the mind&#8221; and allowed the development of more creative ideas — opening a crack of opportunity and flexibility for filmmakers to create films that entertained (provided that their intention to make commercialized movies were not obvious).<br />\nTo a certain extent, this film celebrates the country veering from the stringent eras of the Cultural Revolution, which removed an entire generation from access to university and professional training in the scientific work force.  During the late 1970s, the evolving structure of science and technology under the People&#8217;s Republic mostly thrived from the achievements of poorly educated civilians; hence this film significantly reflects the situation of the development of science and technology in China while the effects of Cultural Revolution slowly loosen its grip on their youngsters.</p>\n<p>My own afterthoughts:<br />\nThis is a wonderfully entertaining film which also hopes to showcase how the country continues to thrive in their development of science and technology, even though most civilian&#8217;s education and certification standards were not high.

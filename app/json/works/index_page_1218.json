Based on David Williamson&#8217;s play of the same name it is the story of Susie O&#8217;Connor (Gia Carides), who says that from the moment she started working for him, her boss sexually harassed her. When she didn&#8217;t submit to his advances, she was sacked. She sues her boss (Anthony LaPaglia) for compensation - but he claims he never touched her and she made it all up. The challenge when watching this highly stylised movie is to determine who is telling the truth and who is telling brilliant lies.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Truth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Truth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/brilliant-lies", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2125313, "name": "Richard Franklin", "creator_id": 23220, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q726445", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2125309, "name": "Bayside Pictures", "creator_id": 27174, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2125306, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41992", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [25421], "external_references": []}, {"id": 88815, "acmi_id": "311428", "title": "Broadcast news", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "broadcast-news", "creator_credit": "James L.

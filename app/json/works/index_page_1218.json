Both dream of one day escaping from the mill, Sean as a tap dancer in Sydney and Mitchell purchasing a tow truck to get out of the only life their stern father has ever known. Tension arrises between the brothers when Sean quits the mill to go to Sydney to study with a well known dance troupe and Mitchell moves in on Sean&#8217;s woman, Linda (Sophie Lee), both brothers finding themselves in love with her. &#8220;Bootmen&#8221; is a feel-good movie that is similar in genre to &#8220;Strictly Ballroom&#8221; and &#8220;The Full Monty&#8221;, a touching and sweet film with wonderful tap dancing sequences. Cast also includes William Zappa, Richard Carter and Susie Porter.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Closed captioning", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sibling rivalry", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Conception", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tap dancing", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2122558, "name": "Dein Perry", "creator_id": 34214, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2122557, "name": "Hilary Linstead", "creator_id": 221, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2122553, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2122548, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50050", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32060], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65541, "acmi_id": "001379", "title": "Boomsville", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "boomsville", "creator_credit": "Yvon Mallette, Robert Verrall and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1967", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1967-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An amusing diagnosis of big city growing pains.

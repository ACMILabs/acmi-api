Boni is perturbed by the arrival of his little sister, Nenette, a teenager who is pregnant and in need of his support. Nenette and Boni have been estranged since the divorce of their parents, having lived separately for many years, and their reunion is fraught and even violent, filtered through the pain of their parents&#8217; relationship.

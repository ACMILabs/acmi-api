While this film culminates in two spectacular battles between the humans of Helm&#8217;s Deep and Saruman&#8217;s vicious minions and Saruman and the Ents, the tale twists and turns around numerous subplots and many new characters, including the twisted half-hobbit Gollum, a warped creature who will do anything to regain what he believes is rightfully his.

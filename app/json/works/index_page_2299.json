Set in early 1990s, Scorsese evokes a New York awash with filth, human degradation, violence, drug abuse and amorality. Nicolas Cage puts in an incendiary performance as Frank - a man struggling to locate his compassion amid the overwhelming cruelty that rages around him.

Ep 3: This episode begins the morning after Agent Cooper&#8217;s dream in which Laura Palmer revealed to him the killer&#8217;s name. Unfortunately, Agent Cooper has forgotten, and he and Sheriff Truman must continue the investigation with FBI forensic expert, Albert Rosenfeld&#8217;s assistance. Meanwhile, the town readies itself for Laura&#8217;s funeral and deals with the arrival of Madeline Ferguson, Laura&#8217;s dark-haired but otherwise identical cousin. Ep 4: Agent Cooper&#8217;s dream visions begin to materialise in this episode as Sarah Palmer, Laura&#8217;s mother, has a vision of the evil man named Bob, and Deputy Hawke has located the One-Armed Man. Laura&#8217;s classmate, Audrey Horne, has also been looking for clues as she begins to suspect that her father may have some involvement in Laura&#8217;s murder. &#8220;Twin Peaks&#8221; is a soap opera and police drama as reinterpreted by the leading urrealist of contemporary cinema.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["04:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hungarian", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Portuguese", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sudden death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sudden death - Psychological aspects", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2283259, "name": "David Lynch", "creator_id": 4092, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2071", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283260, "name": "Duwayne Dunham", "creator_id": 86989, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283262, "name": "Tim Hunter", "creator_id": 26015, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q548834", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283261, "name": "Tina Rathborne", "creator_id": 80792, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16150096", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283258, "name": "Gregg Fienberg", "creator_id": 78779, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5606526", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283256, "name": "Frost Productions", "creator_id": 18672, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035611", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2283255, "name": "Lynch/Frost Productions", "creator_id": 4060, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2283253, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52328", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [33918]}, {"id": 94411, "acmi_id": "318261", "title": "Napoleon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "napoleon-dvd", "creator_credit": "Abel Gance, Films Historiques and Societe Generale Des Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1927", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1927-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 53474, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1632158"}], "brief_description": "<p>This epic historical bio-pic, filmed in 1925, was planned as one of several portraying the life of French war hero Napoleon Bonaparte.

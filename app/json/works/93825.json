Born in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec, Reeves has always been preoccupied with the relationship of nature and the universe going on to study at Cornell University in the United States with some of the great scientific minds of the 20th century. Dedicating his life to astrophysics, Reeves received the Albert Einstein Award for his work in nucleosynthesis in June 2001. In this biographical documentary he discusses the history of astrophysics and about eminent professors like Hans Bethe, Philip Morrison and Bob Wilson whose research led to the atom bomb; the advancement in telescopes and photographic techniques over time; the Big Bang theory; his philosophical beliefs about the universe and his oneness with nature. Interspersed throughout the program are interviews and conversations with neighbours and friends (he now lives on a farm in France) and revealing anecdotes about Einstein, Niels Bohr, Oppenheimer and Teller. He also expresses his deep concern about the potential destruction of our planet ecologically and environmentally but that the globalisation of ecological movements offers hope. An inspiring individual and an interesting and informative documentary containing some amazing images of the galaxies, planets, and stars that make up our universe. Also contains some b&amp;w archival footage. Photography by Philippe Lavalette and narration by Iolande Cadrin-Rossignol.

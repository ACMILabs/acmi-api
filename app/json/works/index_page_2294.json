The film traces their sexually charged and turbulent relationship which began in Dublin in 1904 and survived through periods of poverty, jealousy, pride and betrayal. Moving to Europe to escape the confining traditions and religious attitudes of Ireland, the couple endured years of hardship and despair, interspersed with moments of extravagance, to pursue Joyce&#8217;s literary aspirations.

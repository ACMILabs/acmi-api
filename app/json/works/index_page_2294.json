Renowned for pushing his body to its limits through durational performance, body modification and surgical enhancement, Stelarc has established a decades-long practice that explores the intersection between the human body and technology, proposing a post-human understanding of the world. This unique archive of video and photographic documentation spans the artist’s early hook suspensions and internal body probes to performances with a robotic third arm and experiments in virtual realities.</p>\n<p>The collection is housed on a variety of formats used since the introduction of video in the 1970s, including reel-to-reel tape, VHS, U-Matic, SP Betacam and Mini DV. These variable formats are currently being digitised to ensure the preservation and legacy of the artist’s archive.</p>\n<p>The Stelarc Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the artist through the Cultural Gifts Program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Moving Image Collection"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2059789, "name": "Stelarc", "creator_id": 8996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "video_links": [{"id": 1381, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFOe0JbUdJk"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "video_links": [{"id": 1382, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--2cUhHwo60"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 118261, "acmi_id": "B2003948", "title": "[Stelarc: The Third Hand Tokyo 1981]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-the-third-hand-tokyo-1981", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "173786", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970s-2000s Decade", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970s-2000s Decade"}], "labels": [58688]}, {"id": 116964, "acmi_id": "B2001997", "title": "Unreserved : stories from Truganina Explosives Reserve", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "unreserved-stories-from-truganina-explosives-reserve", "creator_credit": "Alan Young and Bronwen Gray", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2005", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2005-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Unreserved : Stories from Truganina Explosives Reserve is the culmination of a community arts project involving local residents and some of Melbourne&#8217;s up and coming designers.

Featuring Olivier Gourmet in the role of Olivier, a somewhat dour carpenter who teaches his craft to help rehabilitate troubled teenagers and Morgan Marinne as Francis, the new student who becomes an object of inexplicable obsession by his teacher, Olivier. This ambiguously slow-moving story is stark and intensely gripping as it moves towards its unexpected ending. Cast also includes Isabella Soupart with verite-style cinematography by Alain Marcoen.

Whilst the set-up of Wertmuller&#8217;s work is intriguing, drawing on the political frictions of Italian society whilst examining the fundamentals of human nature and desire, the brutality of Gennarino&#8217;s attitude to Raeffaella (including physical violence) is troubling, especially in light of her devotion. Interestingly it is Raeffaella who is aware that their love stands little chance of survival in the real world, and Gennarino who remains deluded.

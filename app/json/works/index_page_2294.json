A man who once had left wing political leanings, Hoefgen is forced to renounce his personal politics and even betray former colleagues in order to gain favour with the Nazis and advance his career. &#8220;Mephisto&#8221; is a compelling portrait of an artist whose ambition is in conflict with his integrity. The mood and aesthetics of 1930s Berlin are aptly evoked in this award winning drama (Oscar for Best Foreign Film, 1982). Directed by Istran Durnoik (Sunshine, Meeting Venus) and also starring Krystyna Janda and Ildiko Bansagi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German", "German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hungary", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National socialism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Germany - History - 1933-1945", "Literature&nbsp;→ German literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Places&nbsp;→ Hungary"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960323, "name": "Ma Film", "creator_id": 23076, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960324, "name": "Manfred Durniok", "creator_id": 17106, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960325, "name": "Istvan Szabo", "creator_id": 23077, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49696", "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [31757]}, {"id": 70314, "acmi_id": "006952", "title": "Meow meow", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "meow-meow", "creator_credit": "Yellow Ball Workshop, Ruckus Films, Dominic Falcone, Red Grooms and Yvonne Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1970", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A man and his pet lion.

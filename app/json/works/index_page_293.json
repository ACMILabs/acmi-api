When Flik endangers the future of the ant colony, Princess Atta sends him away to find help. A gang of grasshoppers- led by the menacing Hopper, will return by the end of the summer to accept the colony&#8217;s offering, which will take the colony the whole summer to collect. Flik runs into a group of circus performing insects who he mistakenly thinks are warriors. Will the colourful troupe and Flik be able to save the colony from Hopper&#8217;s wrath? Includes the voices of Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, Denis Leary, Madeline Kahn and Roddy McDowall. Look out for the bloopers at the end of the film. The video also includes the Pixar animated short &#8220;The Game&#8221; which won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Animated Short.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Insects", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Animation&nbsp;→ Computer animation", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/une-vie-de-bestiole", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1970140, "name": "John Lasseter", "creator_id": 69005, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970139, "name": "Kevin Reher", "creator_id": 78814, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970138, "name": "Darla Anderson", "creator_id": 30287, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970137, "name": "Pixar Animation Studios", "creator_id": 27262, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1970136, "name": "Walt Disney Pictures", "creator_id": 66972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1970135, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45114", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27694], "external_references": []}, {"id": 88203, "acmi_id": "310735", "title": "A Rat's tale = Die Story von Monty Spinnerratz", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-rats-tale-die-story-von-monty-spinnerratz", "creator_credit": "Michael F.

In this work remaining band members are reunited to reminisce about past glories and those departed, and in order to stage a concert that celebrates their contribution to music. Using archival footage, this work also addresses the cultural revolution of the rhythm and blues movement of the 1950s and the racism and inequities that saw the originators of the music, principally African Americans, languish whilst their white counterparts (such as Elvis Presley) prospered. In Detroit the Funk brothers overcame these hurdles with a new sound - known as Motown - that not only championed their artistry but also were phenomenally successful, producing hit after hit.

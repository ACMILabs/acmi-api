Musicians featured in the reunion concert include: Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Me&#8217;Shell Ndege Ocello, Chaka Khan, Bootsy Collins and the Funk Brothers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Concerts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motown Record Corporation", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Soul music", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/standing-in-the-shadows-of-motown", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2308969, "name": "Paul Justman", "creator_id": 36599, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q113351866", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308967, "name": "Paul Justman", "creator_id": 36599, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q113351866", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308965, "name": "Sandy Passman", "creator_id": 80893, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036393", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308964, "name": "Rimshot Productions", "creator_id": 36597, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079059", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2308962, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52551", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34084]}]}

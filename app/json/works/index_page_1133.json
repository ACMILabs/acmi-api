This tape documents two &#8216;great escapes&#8217;. The first is the famous escape by Allied soldiers from Stalag Luft III which was immortalised in the movie &#8220;The Great escape&#8221; (1963) starring Steve McQueen. Using only eating utensils, 600 men worked for a year to dig a tunnel from the designs of &#8216;tunnel king&#8217; Wally Floody. 76 men escaped through the tunnel in 1944. Archival photographs and the personal recollections of surviving escapees highlight the complexity of the operation, while historians reveal the Nazi&#8217;s harsh response to the escape. The second escape documented is that by 25 Nazi officers from an Arizona prisoner-of-war camp: the largest escape from a US camp. It is a little known fact that most of the 500,000 German prisoners of World War II were actually held in POW camps within the US.

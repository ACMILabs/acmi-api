But by the end of the film Jeff has learned that he&#8217;s happiest when reason triumphs over feeling, and he joins the gang at a marshmallow roast.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:12:48:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Ephemeral films", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental hygiene", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental hygiene - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Personality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 849894, "name": "Coronet Instructional Films", "creator_id": 12005, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21982", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1950", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1950"}], "labels": [5863], "external_references": []}, {"id": 66370, "acmi_id": "002379", "title": "Control of body temperature", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "control-of-body-temperature", "creator_credit": "Encyclopaedia Britannica Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1940", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1940-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>By means of laboratory demonstrations, animated drawings, and microphotography, the phenomena associated with variations in body temperature in animals and in human beings are shown.

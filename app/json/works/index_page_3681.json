This film springs from a strong attachment to the Australian bush landscape, an echo of the spirit of kinship that imbued the life of the Aboriginal tribes. The film is a camera calligraphy moving through the bush, capturing textures, surfaces, shadows and light, details of foliage and expanses of rocks and trees, insects and birds - it sees the bush in much the same way as Aboriginal hunters may have seen it, moving rapidly through it. The complexity of the images is repeated in the Aboriginal music, visuals and sounds forming a rhythmic pattern.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:08:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural areas - Australia", "Experimental", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1067231, "name": "Arthur Cantrill", "creator_id": 11442, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1067232, "name": "Corinne Cantrill", "creator_id": 11443, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21147", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [5045]}, {"id": 65555, "acmi_id": "001395", "title": "Bottles into dolls", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bottles-into-dolls", "creator_credit": "Children's Library and Craft Movement, Arthur Cantrill and Corinne Cantrill", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1962", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Children learn to enjoy the art of making dolls from bottles, with plasticine.

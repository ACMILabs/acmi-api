Over the next thirty years we see their lives unfold, as this energetic and outwards-looking man records his work, his leisure, and the violent political upheavals of his country.</p>\n<p>Like an epic novel, Mr N&#8217;s film diary has a huge cast of characters from all strata of society, a wide range of settings - both urban and rural, and every year or so, a new baby born to Ilona.</p>\n<p>Mr N films prolifically and without self-consciousness, documenting what intrigues, interests and impresses him. His family survives the 1944 seige of Budapest by spending winter in an air raid shelter; in &#8216;53 he films several of his eight children marching in a May Day rally; in &#8216;56 a crowd destroying a statue of Stalin; in &#8216;67 Ilona lying on a deck chair, reading a glamour magazine.

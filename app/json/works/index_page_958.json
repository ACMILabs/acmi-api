Apart from his nationalism, the film depicts his early love for an opera singer and his affection for the folk music and people of Poland.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Poland", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Poland - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Chopin, Frederic, 1810-1849", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Chopin, Frederic, 1810-1849", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 947690, "name": "Film Polski", "creator_id": 12338, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947691, "name": "Alexander Ford", "creator_id": 18921, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "30753", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 44, "name": "Poland", "slug": "poland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1951", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1951"}], "labels": [14506], "external_references": [{"id": 6389, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "204293"}]}, {"id": 74990, "acmi_id": "012219", "title": "The Yellow leaf", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-yellow-leaf", "creator_credit": "Julian Biggs, ONF | NFB and Fergus McDonell", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1956", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1956-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A sympathetic study of an elderly widow, forced to leave her daughter&#8217;s household to live in a home for the aged.

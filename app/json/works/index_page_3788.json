It has mainstream appeal, strengthened by its dubbed English dialogue with thick American accents. The story, which follows a group of young and ambitious locals, would have struck a chord with the country&#8217;s youth population. The use of contemporary Peking as the backdrop to the story further conveys the film&#8217;s desire to situate itself within the modern world.<br />\n(4 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 11, 2012)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 835915, "name": "Changchun Film Studio", "creator_id": 34767, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 835916, "name": "Wang Fengkui", "creator_id": 82676, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 835917, "name": "Peng Mingyan", "creator_id": 82677, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835918, "name": "Liu Fengdi", "creator_id": 82678, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835919, "name": "Zhou Lijing", "creator_id": 82679, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835920, "name": "Lu Liang", "creator_id": 82680, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835921, "name": "Zhong Xinghuo", "creator_id": 82681, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835922, "name": "Lu Liping", "creator_id": 82682, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835923, "name": "Li Wangfang", "creator_id": 82683, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835924, "name": "Wang Fengkui", "creator_id": 82676, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146453", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [55299], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93803, "acmi_id": "317416", "title": "Beijing bicycle", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "beijing-bicycle-dvd", "creator_credit": "Pyramide Productions, Arc Light Films, Peggy Chiao, Han Sanping, Xiaoming Xu and Wang Xiaoshuai", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A tale of urban isolation, class consciousness, and peer group pressure, &#8220;Beijing bicycle&#8221; plays out as a re-imagining of De Sica&#8217;s classic Italian neo-realist film, &#8220;Bicycle thieves.&#8221; Gui, a rural young man, decides to relocate to Beijing and lands a job as a courier on the condition that he pay off his bicycle with numerous (over fifty) trips - after which the bicycle is his to keep.

Filmed in Ireland, Canada, the United States and Italy, Part 1 contrasts the experiences of contemporary active nuns, living and working amidst poverty and crime, with the story of a young woman whose search for spirituality led her to a monastery near Rome. The film explores some of the roots of the paternalistic attitudes that have dominated the Catholic Church almost since its inception and the resultant denigration and sometimes persecution of religious women. Part 1 ends with contemporary nuns voicing their feelings about love and sexuality.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nuns", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 898415, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898416, "name": "Signe Johansson", "creator_id": 76285, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898417, "name": "Kathleen Shannon", "creator_id": 74177, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 898418, "name": "Margaret Wescott", "creator_id": 74615, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 898414, "name": "Educational Media Australia", "creator_id": 11964, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "34243", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [17937], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65335, "acmi_id": "320114", "title": "Behind the skyscrapers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "behind-the-skyscrapers", "creator_credit": "Frederick Niemann, National Women's Christian Temperance Union and White Ribbon", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1963", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Documentary of life on &#8220;Skid Row&#8221;, a section of a metropolitan city, where down and out people live in doorways and in condemned housing.

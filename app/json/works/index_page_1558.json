In this episode Andrew MacKenzie deviates from the program&#8217;s usual format to incorporate an in-depth interview with English artist, art critic, writer and television producer, Matthew Collings on the eve of his Australian lecture tour, 2002. Collings provides a refreshing and challenging outlook on contemporary art and provides contextual observation on contemporary art values and practice. Collings is best known for the BBC series &#8216;This is Modern Art&#8217; and his book &#8216;Crazy Nation&#8217; amongst others. Screen Talk this week looks at the work of Geneine Honey and includes an interview with excerpts from &#8216;Young Sad Love&#8217; and &#8216;Don&#8217;t Go Out Walking&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Themes, motives", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art appreciation", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art criticism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Conceptual art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Minimal art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Painting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233159, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233161, "name": "Lena Corner", "creator_id": 80529, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121336963", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233154, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233152, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51761", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33415]}, {"id": 93907, "acmi_id": "317662", "title": "Public hangings.

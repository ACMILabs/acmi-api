Its lyrical recording of the streetlife of everyday Berlin owes something to the cycle of &#8216;city symphony&#8217; films popular in the mid-Twenties. Onto this documentary background is grafted a simple narrative focusing on the interactions between five young Berliners&#8212;all played by non-professional actors&#8212;who spend a typical Sunday together in and around Berlin. The film launched the careers of all six principal filmmakers involved, and had a huge influence on subsequent film movements including the French New Wave, Italian Neorealist and British Free Cinema movements. This restored version contains important scenes previously missing and features a new score by Elena Kats-Chernin. Written by Billie Wilder, Curt Sidomak and Robert Sidomak. Photography, Eugen Schufftan and Fred Zinnemann.

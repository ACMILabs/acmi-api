King Leontes of Sicilia suspects his wife of adultery with his friend the king of Bohemia. He orders that his new born daughter be left in a desolate place to die. The oracle of Apollo declares that Leontes will live without an heir and soon after his only son dies. The baby girl Perdita is found and raised by shepherds and grows to be loved by Florizel the son of the king of Bohemia. It is discovered that Perdita is the lost daughter of Leontes, and then he is happily reunited with his daughter, his wife Hermione, and his old friend the king of Bohemia.

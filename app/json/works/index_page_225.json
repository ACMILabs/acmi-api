The circular movements of the sculpture and camera in combination provide a pendulous, hypnotic effect that is both a document of the sculpture and an elegant visual dance of shape-shifting forms and transformed light. The rhythmic combinations of stasis and dynamism across altered variations of screen space and superimpositions of motion and form makes for a vertiginous visual experience.<br />\nAlthough it cannot replicate the immersive experience of the light sculpture, the film creates a viewing space in which the audience is visually disoriented by Moholy-Nagy&#8217;s spatial dislocations. As the artist anticipated, this creates a sensation of detachment, of &#8216;floating&#8217;, amid a dynamic vision of light&#8217;s relationship to spatial understanding.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Experimental", "Silent films"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1901072, "name": "Laszlo Moholy-Nagy", "creator_id": 7134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD ROM; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "514", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1930", "notes": "", "to_year": "1930"}], "labels": [47748], "external_references": []}, {"id": 603, "acmi_id": "B1001895", "title": "Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-trip-to-the-moon-le-voyage-dans-la-lune", "creator_credit": "Georges Melies", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1902", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1902-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Melies&#8217; fantastical vision of life on the moon.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 289, "name": "Space, sci-fi and cinema fakes", "description": "Magic lantern slides were used to entertain and educate audiences in home, theatres and universities.

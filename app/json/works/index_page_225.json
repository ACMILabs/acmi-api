With the unwelcome mantle of ‘most locked-down city in the world’, Melbourne audiences were at the forefront of artist Laura Duffy’s mind when she created <i>Spawn</i>. Duffy mixes materials together like potions, encouraging audiences to consider texture through filmic spaces in which the natural and unnatural writhe upon one another – slipping, dripping, bubbling, congealing.</p>\n<p>Responsive to a context of global pandemic mixed in with climate crisis, Duffy is moved by sentiments of kindness and generosity, inviting audiences into the ‘poetic, fun, fresh, flowery, camp and flirty’ world of <i>Spawn</i>.</p>\n<p>The work reflects Duffy’s belief that materials are collaborative, complete with their own stories, histories and energies. The artist combines these materials to critique and shatter binary thinking of natural and unnatural as separate, instead embracing the complexity and blur of binaries. ‘How are we able to unleash from the constraints of “nature” to find new pleasures? A Post-nature embrace of all that is and will be, even if it&#8217;s toxic?’ Duffy questions.</p>\n<p><i>Spawn</i> is also a work about gratitude. A filmic study of death and transformation. As golden liquid pours over rotting, spinning fruits and flowers, Duffy encourages us to ‘say thank you and rejoice in transformation and transmutation.’</p>\n<p>An additional element of the work will be released in January 2022. Conscious that so many of us have been confined to our homes and tied to our screens, Duffy is collaborating with artist and friend Aliyah Winter to create a downloadable audio work that we can walk around with, enjoying at our leisure, wherever we please.</p>\n<p>– Serena Bentley, Curator, ACMI</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>What do freak-science, fairies and queer flower coding have in common?</p>\n<p>These themes intersect in a new experimental video work by Te Whanganui A-Tara based artist Laura Duffy. &#8220;Spawn&#8221; explores political underpinnings of categorisations of ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ in relation to bodies.

Single-story terrace houses can be seen in the background.</p>\n<p>The family makes a stop-over at a cat and kitten shelter. A handwritten sign scrawled across the side of the building reads: “All cats and kittens in the hostel are stray and unwanted. Their health cannot be guaranteed. Please consult your vet and have your cat immunised immediately”.  Beside the writing there is another sign reading “Kindly give a donation thank you”. Val plays with a kitten and presumably adopts it as she carries it into their car.</p>\n<p>Families enjoy a couple of trips to the country, including a picnic under pine trees.  A small boy attempts to climb one of the trees with hands-on assistance from Maurie.  Val swings from a branch, flailing her legs comically. Lunch is cooked on a portable tripod-style wood-fuelled barbeque, while people sit in plastic banana lounges and picnic chairs. There is general banter and typical outdoor revelry among the friends.

After a series of lengthy medical tests, it&#8217;s revealed that Lorenzo is suffering from Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a degenerative disease carried by mothers and passed on to sons. Doctors give Lorenzo a life expectancy of only 2 more years and a horrendous series of side affects until then. A relatively new disease, medical experts have little hope to offer in regards to treatment or cure. Unflagging against insurmountable odds, the Odenes set out researching the disease themselves and communicating with other families afflicted by ALD.

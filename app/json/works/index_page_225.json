I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened.

I&#8217;ve sent people off and I&#8217;ve warned people. I&#8217;d rather give them a 50-meter or talk to them than things like that. Because I thought that was a lot easier. Because well, I got more respect by doing that than reporting. That&#8217;s the way I looked at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT: Fizz was always on the side of the bloke that hit second, because he thought the bloke that hit second had a reason to hit.

If there was biffo or something happening, Fizz wasn&#8217;t going to run in and try and be authoritarian. He&#8217;d just throw the ball up, or bounce the ball, and just get on with it, you know? And if there was 10 blokes belting the heebie-jeebies out of each other down the road, well, eventually they&#8217;d stop, because the footy&#8217;d come into their area.

And on one wing, we used to have to wade through ferns to get the ball.</p>\n<p>There was rabbits all around the area at those times, and it was often when we were crossing the creek, there&#8217;d be rabbits running around everywhere.

And often the ball would hit that, and if you were standing on the wire, you were surprised when you found yourself you had the ball.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>DON DUUS: I don&#8217;t know whether the Chewton fullback knew he could hit the lines, but he hit them very, very regular. And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on. And of course, if the umpire told us that we could play on if the power lines were hit, we used to play on and kick goals, much to the annoyance of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The Harcourt was pretty bad. It had a big creek running down one side of it. And many a player&#8217;s disappeared down the creek. Kyneton was a little bit difficult.

And on one wing, we used to have to wade through ferns to get the ball.</p>\n<p>There was rabbits all around the area at those times, and it was often when we were crossing the creek, there&#8217;d be rabbits running around everywhere. [LAUGHS] And well, as you can see, the ground has not changed.</p>\n<p>[SHEEP BLEATING]</p>\n<p>There were a lot of grounds that were in pretty ordinary condition in those days.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I remember on the Chewton football ground in the Castlemaine league, that electric light was running through the ground about the center half forward position. And often the ball would hit that, and if you were standing on the wire, you were surprised when you found yourself you had the ball.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>DON DUUS: I don&#8217;t know whether the Chewton fullback knew he could hit the lines, but he hit them very, very regular. And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on. And of course, if the umpire told us that we could play on if the power lines were hit, we used to play on and kick goals, much to the annoyance of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The Harcourt was pretty bad. It had a big creek running down one side of it. And many a player&#8217;s disappeared down the creek. Kyneton was a little bit difficult. You would always walk off the Kyneton ground four to six inches taller, because the black turfy ground from here used to build up on your boots.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Trenton and Woodend weren&#8217;t too bad when we played out with them. But the biggest trouble there was the snow. We played on Woodend, I think it was, at one stage on about 6 inches of snow.</p>\n<p>And I remember one of the players, real tough, hard player, come out. He says, Duusy, I&#8217;m gonna kill you, with a smile on his face. So during the game I thought I&#8217;d get even with him.</p>\n<p>I bent  down, picked up a handful of snow, squeezed it up hard in a ball, and let him have it behind the ear&#8212; not knowing that it had gone to ice. It nearly knocked him out. It was great fun. He just turned around and said, will you buy me a beer afterwards? And that was the way it was.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>If you meet up with some of the old players of those days, you still stop and have a talk about it. The subject is always football. You always get back to when we played. Wasn&#8217;t it good when we played? Wasn&#8217;t it different when we played?</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:10:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values":

Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller. The films were made on Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is predominantly comprised of a trip through the Snowy Mountains, including some lovely footage of the landscape.</p>\n<p>This

With flashbacks and minimal dialogue Bergman lays out the emotional landscape of this family&#8217;s fragile bonds that strain under the imminent death of one. Clocks are a repeated motif for the passage of time, and a reminder of the women&#8217;s mortality; sound and colour play an important part in the narrative with red (wine, walls, curtains) representing the soul&#8217;s interior. Set in the late 1800s, &#8216;Cries and Whispers&#8217; is an intense, disturbing and powerful family drama about repression, spirituality, sexual passion, hatred and death.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, director, writer, Ingmar Bergman ; photography, Sven Nykvist ; editing, Siv Lundgren.<br />\nCast: Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin, Liv Ullmann, Erland Josephson, Henning Moritzen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sisters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Sweden", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2650401, "name": "Ingmar Bergman", "creator_id": 10138, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7546", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650399, "name": "Cinematograph for Svenska Filminstitutet", "creator_id": 25304, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034748", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2650400, "name": "Svenska filminstitutet", "creator_id": 14106, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1146587", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146313", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 43, "name": "Sweden", "slug": "sweden"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [55168]}, {"id": 115673, "acmi_id": "F000017", "title": "Sommaren med Monika = Summer with Monika", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sommaren-med-monika-summer-with-monika", "creator_credit": "Ingmar Bergman, Allan Ekelund and Svensk Filmindustri", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Sweden, 1952", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1952-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A chance meeting between Harry, an errand boy, and Monika, a wild and reckless young woman from the poorer quarter of Stockholm (a strikingly assured performance by Andersson), leads to an affair and an escape from the city for a holiday on the nearby islands.

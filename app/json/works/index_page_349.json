Marcello Mastroianni plays a film director, Guido Anselmi, who is beset by adoring fans, angry mistresses, nervous financial backers and hostile critics while in the process of directing his current film. Mixing autobiography, fantastical dream sequences, imaginative sets and starkly photographed childhood memories, &#8220;8 1/2&#8221; is the most entertaining and stimulating film ever made about film-making. Cast includes Claudia Cardinale, Anouk Aimee and Barbara Steele. Music score by Nino Rota. Voted second best film ever made by a &#8220;Sight and Sound&#8221; international poll in 1992. The film won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1963.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture producers and directors - Italy", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Creative ability", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/81-2", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962130, "name": "Cineriz", "creator_id": 60689, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962131, "name": "Francinex", "creator_id": 60690, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962132, "name": "Angelo Rizzoli", "creator_id": 60744, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3617191", "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962133, "name": "Federico Fellini", "creator_id": 60737, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7371", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50892", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1962", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1962"}], "labels": [32845], "external_references": [{"id": 1768, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q12018"}, {"id": 3301, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "422"}]}, {"id": 84683, "acmi_id": "306017", "title": "3:10 to Yuma = Three ten to Yuma", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "310-to-yuma-three-ten-to-yuma", "creator_credit": "Columbia Pictures, David Heilwell and Delmer Daves", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>After a stage coach hold-up and killing, outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford) is captured.

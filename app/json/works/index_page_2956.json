She played the role of Gaby in her US debut film &#8220;Algiers&#8221; (1938), followed by &#8220;Lady of the tropics&#8221; (1939), &#8220;White cargo&#8221; (1942) and &#8220;Samson and Delilah&#8221; (1949). Ava Gardner&#8217;s career began slowly with many bit parts, but her more memorable roles included the films &#8220;Show boat&#8221; (1951), The Snows of Kilimanjaro&#8221; (1952), &#8220;Mogambo&#8221; (1953) and &#8220;On the beach (1959). Her sultry beauty combined with an elusive and sometimes cool manner captured many of her leading men and her marriages first to Mickey Rooney, then Artie Shaw and finally Frank Sinatra all made front page headlines. Rita Hayworth trained as a dancer from early childhood and made her first film debut at age 16 in &#8220;Dante&#8217;s inferno&#8221; (1935) in a minor role.

However it was the film &#8220;Gilda&#8221; (1946) that evoked a sensual and stunningly dynamic image, launching Rita Hayworth into superstardom. Brigitte Bardot, French, blonde and sexy, made her screen debut as Javotte Lemoine in &#8220;Le Trou normand&#8221; (1952), married Roger Vadim and starred in her first US production &#8220;Un acte d&#8217;amour&#8221; (1954) with Kirk Douglas. Brigitte however continued to star in French productions which were dubbed for her American fans, including the Roger Vadim directed &#8220;Et dieu crea la femme = And God created woman&#8221; (1957).

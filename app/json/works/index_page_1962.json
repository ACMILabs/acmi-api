After a series of sequences set in the suburbs of Paris, introducing the characters, and showing them doing various temporary jobs, a whimsical twist of fate allows the threesome to make their dream come true. The plot follows their adventures in the United States as they journey south to Louisiana. Although they encounter obstacles aplenty, and are forced by lack of money into bumming train rides or stealing from a garage, they also bathe in the warmth of a more tolerant atmosphere than they have come to expect in France.&#8221; Reference: &#8220;Questions of identity in Beur cinema: from &#8216;Tea in the Harem&#8217; to &#8216;Cheb&#8217;&#8221;.

Rather than being a sweeping epic, this film examines the fight of a small group of Protestants for survival in the mountainous Cevennes region. Some of the story is told using excerpts from the diary kept by an actual participant in the conflict. The movie is notable for its period authenticity and historical accuracy.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Rene Allio ; writers, Jean Jourdheuil, Rene Allio ; photography, Denys Clairval ; music, Philippe Arthuys.<br />\nCast: Francois Marthouret, Dominique Labourier, Rufus, Isabelle Sadoyan, Jacques Debary, Genevieve Mnich, Maurice Benichou, Suzy Rambaud, Jean Benguigui, Christine Laurent.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2560701, "name": "Rene Allio", "creator_id": 82966, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146784", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [55554]}]}

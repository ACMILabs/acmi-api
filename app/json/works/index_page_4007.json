In the detailed observation of a certain stratum of Bengali society, the film oscillates between wryly humorous chamber piece and domestic tragedy as the heroine breaks through to greater self-awareness and understanding of the male domain. Charulata has been described by Ray&#8217;s biographer Andrew Robinson as &#8216;the most complete fusion of eastern and western sensibility in the cinema&#8217;, eastern in the specific tensions between the characters, western in the way these tensions are resolved, particularly for Charu.

Andrew&#8217;s father, Lindsay, who himself was a champion basketballer, had a profound influence on Andrew as his coach and mentor and to this day, there is still a very close bond between the two of them. Down to earth, highly respected by his peers, Andrew talks of his highs and lows, his motivation to keep going even when the odds seem to be against him and his career which spans across three decades and includes representing Australia in several Olympic Games, playing for Seton Hall in the NCAA competition, San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets in the NBA and of course the Melbourne Tigers in the NBA. Put together in chronological order with footage from some of his major games, this is an entertaining and informative video which also includes some humorous moments from &#8220;Gaze Cam&#8221;, Andrew&#8217;s own home video shots.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Athletes", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Basketball", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ College sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Gaze, Andrew", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Professional sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - United States", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Gaze, Andrew", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816102, "name": "John Murray", "creator_id": 79667, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 809725, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49341", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31428], "external_references": []}, {"id": 89132, "acmi_id": "311784", "title": "Andrei Rublev", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "andrei-rublev", "creator_credit": "Mosfilm and Andrei Tarkovsky", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Soviet Union, 1966", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1966-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Widely regarded as Tarkovsky&#8217;s finest film, this film charts the life of the great icon painter through a turbulent period of 15th Century Russian history, a period marked by endless fighting between rival Princes and by Tartar invasions.

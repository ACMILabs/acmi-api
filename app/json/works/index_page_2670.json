As circumstances (and friends) conspire to bring Steve and Jeffrey together, Jeffrey begins to warm to the idea of a committed relationship. However, Steve&#8217;s revelation about his HIV-positive status soon throws a spanner in the works and Jeffrey finds himself caught between love and fear once again. Seeking the advice of Sterling and his partner Darius, a post-modern evangelist, a self-help group, his liberal parents, and a randy Catholic priest, Jeffrey struggles to come to terms with the concept that a life lived in fear is no life at all. Features a variety of cameos from stars such as Sigourney Weaver, Camryn Manheim, Olympia Dukakis, Kathy Najimy, Christine Baranski, and Nathan Lane. Based on the play by Paul Rudnick.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ AIDS (Disease) in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ AIDS (Disease) in motion pictures", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ HIV (Viruses)", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960920, "name": "Working Man Films", "creator_id": 34293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960921, "name": "The Booking Office", "creator_id": 34294, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960922, "name": "Mark Balsam", "creator_id": 79908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960923, "name": "Mitchell Maxwell", "creator_id": 79909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960924, "name": "Victoria Maxwell", "creator_id": 79910, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960925, "name": "Christopher Ashley", "creator_id": 34298, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5111868", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50131", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32132], "external_references": [{"id": 2421, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q739754"}]}, {"id": 91254, "acmi_id": "314347", "title": "Jeff Buckley live in Chicago", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jeff-buckley-live-in-chicago-dvd", "creator_credit": "Gary Fisher and Sony Music Video Enterprises", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Jeff Buckley was born in 1966 and died in May 1997 following a tragic drowning accident.

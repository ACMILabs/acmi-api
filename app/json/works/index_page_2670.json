The dialogue at times is perhaps overdone and the film comes across more as a theatrical presentation, lacking a sense of realism. However this is not to take away from Anthony Quinn and Gina Lollobrigida&#8217;s solid performances in their respective roles. Cast also includes Alaine Cuny, Jean Danet, Robert Hirsch, Danielle Dumont, Philippe Clay.

As in most of his later films there is a pervasive nostalgia, a sense of loss. Although a loosely plotted leisurely survey of the extended family structured around journeys, the film is full of conflicts triggered by the grandparents&#8217; visit in which characterisation both enriches and qualifies stark thematic oppositions.

Ivan the Terrible part I is Eisenstein&#8217;s boldest and most successful experiment in stylisation drawing upon other arts - Wagnerian opera, Marinsky ballet and Japanese Kabuki theatre - which he had begun in &#8216;Alexander Nevsky&#8217;. Ivan&#8217;s personal life is interwoven with the themes of his drive for empire and his alliance with the merchant class against the aristocracy. Part II, the last film Eisenstein made, is dominated by cloak-and-dagger intrigue. It was completed in 1946 but not released until 1959. It takes up the story of Ivan the Terrible upon his return to Moscow from Alexandrov. The complex story is full of intrigue, high level political in-fighting, family resentment and suspicion, and assassination plot, executions and murder in the cathedral.

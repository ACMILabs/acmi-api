Mexico in fact celebrated the 100th anniversary of the danzon in the 1990s.

Julia sets out determinedly to find Carmelo, following a trail of clues to Vera Cruz where she encounters an eclectic mix of new friends including a motherly hotel manager with an acerbic tongue, a prostitute with a young baby, and a transvestite named Susy (Tito Vasconcelos).

All she knows is that he is undertaking a dangerous mission for his scientist father (Max Von Sydow). Her search takes her through an end-of-the millineum Europe and Asia in which technology and consumerism has run riot. She traces the stranger to Australia where beneath the desert soil, a group of First Nations and European scientists are hoping to create a society which will save mankind. Combining exceptional graphics, a film noir palette and a metaphysical reflection on alienation and colonial exploitation, &#8220;Until The End of the World&#8221; is a difficult but exhilerating film. Co-starring Jeanne Moreau and Ernie Dingo and featuring a stunning soundtrack including U2, Lou Reed, Nick Cave, Neneh Cherry, Can and REM.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2049041, "name": "Wim Wenders", "creator_id": 4503, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55411", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2049040, "name": "Kim Vecara", "creator_id": 77826, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2049039, "name": "Argos Films", "creator_id": 69972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2049038, "name": "Road Movies Filmproduktion", "creator_id": 4492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2049037, "name": "Village Roadshow Pictures", "creator_id": 838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2049036, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41065", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}, {"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}, {"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [24575], "external_references": []}, {"id": 82157, "acmi_id": "303297", "title": "Preparing for the corroboree", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "preparing-for-the-corroboree-a", "creator_credit": "Howard Hughes, Australia Council.

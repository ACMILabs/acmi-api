It tells of a unique and special friendship between two young boys, Abraham (Roma Alexandrovitch), a nine year-old Jewish boy and Ivan (Sacha Iakovlev), a fourteen year-old Catholic boy, and their determination to remain best friends as religious prejudices begin to surface in the Polish community and within Abraham&#8217;s own family.

Monitor 640 x 480 resolution, 16 bit colour (thousands of colours). 8X CD drive or faster. Optional external speakers or headphones. Jointly funded by the Catholic Education Office in the Kimberley region and two schools - Kururrungku Catholic Education Centre and John Pujajangka Plyrin Catholic School, &#8216;Learning Walmajarri&#8217; is the result of digitising elements of the program taught by tribal elders in the Walmajarri-speaking areas around Broome. &#8220;The multimedia format of a CD is well suited to the oral tradition, which is the context in which the elders teach their language, using songs and stories to impart vocabulary and syntax&#8221;(&#8216;The Australian&#8217; Tuesday June 8 199 pg. 20). Designed to assist in improving literacy amongst Walmajarri speakers, this program uses jigsaws and traditional stories and songs as entertaining instruction, although people who have no previous experience with Walmajarri may be tempted to give it a try.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Education", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Multimedia systems", "Computer program", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Language - Study and teaching", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Children - Language", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Literacy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Language", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Children - Language", "Multimedia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1786153, "name": "Catholic Education Office of Western Australia", "creator_id": 29603, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "CD ROM; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44029", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27055], "external_references": []}, {"id": 86747, "acmi_id": "308441", "title": "Discovery : Explore the world of oil & gas (MAC & PC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "discovery-explore-the-world-of-oil-gas-mac-pc", "creator_credit": "Fusion and Macromedia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Take a first hand look at the oil and gas industry in Australia.

After another disastrous New Years Eve, Bridget makes a resolution to keep a diary, lose weight, cut down on her smoking and drinking, and above all, find herself the perfect man. Her mother tries to assist her in her search for a man, setting her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, in a role comparable to his performance as Mr. Darcy in &#8216;Pride and Prejudice&#8217;), the son of an old family friend. Unfortunately, the first man to notice the new Bridget is her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), a chauvinistic womaniser with whom she starts a love affair, despite her attraction to Mark. Bridget&#8217;s confusion over her attraction to Mark, her relationship with Daniel, is complicated by her meddling and slightly eccentric friends, and the breakdown of her parent&#8217;s relationship. Based on the novel by Helen Fielding. Cast also includes Gemma Jones, Celia Imrie, Hugh Grant and Jim Broadbent.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Portuguese", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Dating (Social customs)", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Body image", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/bridget-joness-diary", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1973751, "name": "Sharon Maguire", "creator_id": 79875, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973750, "name": "Liza Chasin", "creator_id": 79874, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973749, "name": "Debra Hayward", "creator_id": 79873, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973748, "name": "Working Title Films", "creator_id": 71468, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973747, "name": "Studio Canal", "creator_id": 31030, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973746, "name": "Little Bird Ltd", "creator_id": 34208, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1973745, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50048", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32058], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92550, "acmi_id": "315846", "title": "Tomorrow never dies [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tomorrow-never-dies-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Roger Spottiswoode, Barbara Broccoli, Michael Wilson and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;James Bond&#8221;.<br />\nThe 18th in the Bond series finds Bond (Pierce Brosnan) battling crazed media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) who is intent on starting a war between England and China.

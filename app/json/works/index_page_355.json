In the tradition of true melodramas a love conflict develops between the white chief and Beatrice and leads to an epic Chauvel finale. Filmed in North Queensland and Palm Island and featuring spectacular rainforest and river cinematography, director Chauvel made this film in an attempt to break into the American market. Censorship problems relating to nude swimming as well as violence were eventually overcome for the Australian release while a censored version was released on the overseas market.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Australia - History", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 793364, "name": "Expeditionary Films", "creator_id": 66805, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 793365, "name": "Charles Chauvel", "creator_id": 66792, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q453792", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 793363, "name": "ScreenSound Australia", "creator_id": 16130, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42737", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1936", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1936"}], "labels": [26000], "external_references": []}]}

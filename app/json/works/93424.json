Contains footage of the infamous World Cup final between Uruguay and Brazil and examines the after effects on the black players - who were blamed squarely for the loss. The arrival of Pele (aged 17) brought black pride back to many Brazilians and saw the rise of one of the world&#8217;s greatest, and most beloved, players. Another great player, Garincha (a contemporary of Pele&#8217;s) also became a figure of Brazilian pride. Current problems for football in Brazil are addressed here - poverty, elitism, corruption and the exiting of players to Europe. Interviews: Ronaldo, Zico, Didi, Pele, Zizinho, Roberto Rivelino, Socates, Carlos Alberto Parreira, Mario Zagallo, Tele Santana. &#8220;South American Superpowers&#8221; Examines the influence of South American players on soccer, and the ways in which the phenomenal success of such teams has changed the nature of football. Illuminating interviews includes an unrepentant Maradona justifying the &#8220;Hand of God&#8221; goal that knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup. Contains footage of the Uruguay team at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, and at the 1930 World Cup. Examines the rivalries between Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina, as well as on-field violence that has marred the sport. Briefly explores the relationship between politics and football in certain countries; the problematic rise of football in Columbia and Mexico; and the circumstances surrounding the murder of Columbian player Andres Escobar. Interviews include Ceasar Luis Menotti, Jorge Valdano, Jose Sanfilippo, Alberto Spencer, Juan Schiaffino, Roque Maspoli, Alcides Ghigga, Rene Higuita, Leonel Sanshez, Carlos Caszely and Hugo Sanchez.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>History of football.

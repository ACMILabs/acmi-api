The collection was donated to ACMI by Michaelis&#8217;s daughter, Sally Cohen, and her husband Sheldon Cohen. The films show life in Melbourne including the 1956 Olympic Games, a fishing trip to Bermagui in NSW, and holidays in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This is a home movie from the Michaelis family of early Melbourne. &#8216;Australian Scenes&#8217; is the title on screen and starts with a lovely view from the Yarra looking back to the city skyline. The river bank is packed as an exciting rowing regatta takes place. A great shot facing south from the top of Swanston Street and then the Shrine of Remembrance. We see a passing parade of Australian Army personnel in their slouch hats. A crowd on the steps of the Old Treasury Building. &#8216;Flemington, Cup Day, 1940&#8217; is next with crowds of men in hats and wide shots of the running of the race and winners circle. A tennis match is played in front of a sold-out crowd in the &#8216;1946 Davis Cup Challenge&#8217; at Kooyong&#8217;s tennis courts. A very scenic &#8216;Picnic at Warrandyte&#8217; reflects a relaxing day out with the family in the country. There is footage of Australian native animals at what is possibly Healesville Sanctuary.  &#8216;Bayside Scenes&#8217; shows families enjoying the cooling waters of Port Phillip Bay. &#8216;Autumn at Macedon&#8217; is a brief scene of trees in autumn colours. We then see the 1956 Olympic Games opening in Melbourne and the parade of athletes, releasing doves and the lighting of the flame. The film shows some events shot from the stands.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List (time codes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:35:00:00 rowing regatta on the Yarra<br />\n00:52:00:00 Melbourne street scene with vintage cars and tram #64.

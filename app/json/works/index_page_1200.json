Beginning in 1960, &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; cast of characters included the haughty Annie Walker, formidable matriarch Ena Sharples, busybody Hilda Ogden and her layabout husband Stan, the ordinary Barlow family and tartish Elsie Tanner. The sixties episodes, despite their primitive production values, were much more in the mould of the hard-edged, realistic drama that established Granada&#8217;s reputation, than more recent &#8216;soapier&#8217; seasons. This collection features the first episode, screened in the UK on December 9th, 1960, two episodes each from 1961 (screened February 9th, Christmas Day) and 1962 (screened July 11th, December 12th) and one from 1964 (screened December 23rd).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Soap operas", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television serials - Great Britain", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Soap operas", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television serials&nbsp;→ Television serials - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 883027, "name": "Granada Television International", "creator_id": 13509, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 883026, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51069", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [33003], "external_references": []}, {"id": 76066, "acmi_id": "013819", "title": "The Magic of animation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-magic-of-animation", "creator_credit": "Good Day Productions, Ontario Educational Communications Authority and Rick Butler", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A look at the people and techniques involved in the production of animated films.

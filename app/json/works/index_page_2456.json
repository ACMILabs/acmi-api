In Scola&#8217;s fantastical version of history, they are pursued across country by a coach containing not only the lady-in-waiting Comtesse Sophie de la Borde, but also the cultural celebrities of the period: the legendary lover Giacomo Casanova, the English revolutionary Thomas Paine, and the libertarian writer Restif de la Bretonne. &#8216;La nuit de Varennes&#8217; is hence as much an anthology of eighteenth-century culture as it is a historical account of the Revolution. As &#8216;Les Cahiers du cinema&#8217; noted at the time, political history is presented as literary history through the eyes of idealised witnesses who - along with the spectator - remain at a safe distance from the proletariat. In a gesture typical of the heritage genre, Scola privileges cultural references of all kinds, and in particular literary forms, whether through direct quotations from contemporary texts or through the emphasis on written communication - messages, maps, articles and decrees - which is the motor behind the plot. The central narrative - the king&#8217;s flight from Paris - is moreover framed by the self-conscious device of the puppet show, which first enacts revolutionary events prior to the king&#8217;s disapperance, and ultimately closes with his execution.&#8221; Reference: Guy Austin. &#8216;Contemporary French Cinema&#8217;.

During her nine years as Artistic Director, she encouraged playwrights, poets, actors and musicians to reject theatrical traditions and push the boundaries of performing art. La Mama is synonymous with the renaissance of Australian theatre. Playwrights such as Williamson, Buzo, Dickins, Romeril and Hibberd wrote about contemporary Australia. Actors rejected the formality of conventional theatre and developed a larrikin performance style which reflected a new awareness of cultural identity.

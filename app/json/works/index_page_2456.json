Even though the Indonesians rid themselves of Dutch colonisers in 1949, the new economic order developed by the military has replicated the vastly unequal distribution of wealth that has plagued Indonesia&#8217;s modern history: now, however, the wealthy few are Indonesian not European. This episode examines Indonesia&#8217;s feudal past and the impact of European colonisation on the Indonesian population. The maintenance of feudal authority by the European colonisers is one of the roots, this video claims, of the military&#8217;s successful suppression of democracy in contemporary Indonesia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Imperialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Indonesia - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Indonesia - Social conditions", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Indonesia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Indonesia - History - 1950-1966", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1561789, "name": "Curtis Levy", "creator_id": 13400, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1561788, "name": "Christine Olsen", "creator_id": 69585, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1561787, "name": "AFFC", "creator_id": 24545, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1561786, "name": "Olsen Levy", "creator_id": 69554, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1561785, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115302, "acmi_id": "S01090", "title": "Riding the tiger", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "riding-the-tiger", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 82331, "acmi_id": "303478", "title": "Freedom or death", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "freedom-or-death", "creator_credit": "Curtis Levy, Christine Levy, AFFC and Olsen Levy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 82620, "acmi_id": "303780", "title": "The New order", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-new-order", "creator_credit": "Curtis Levy, Christine Olsen, Zex AFFC and Olsen Levy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38546", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [22141], "external_references": []}, {"id": 69412, "acmi_id": "005888", "title": "Kings' horses", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kings-horses", "creator_credit": "Athos Film Productions, Peter Bucknall and Gerald Weinbien", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>An historical documentary on the relationship between humans and horses.

This illuminating work features historical re-enactments, as well as interviews with contemporary scholars, to recall the ancient worlds depicted in the Bible. Episode 1. &#8220;By the rivers of Babylon&#8221;: In 586 BC, the Israelites were exiled in Babylon and seemed destined to disappear; but they fought back by writing a book using Judean stories to explain the present disastrous situations - the Bible. Episode 2. &#8220;The Book and the sword&#8221;: In 458 BC a scribe named Ezra arrived in Jerusalem from Babylon; gathering the mostly illiterate Judeans together he read the Bible to them. In the following years study of the Bible became an essential part of Jewish life. Episode 3. &#8220;The End of days&#8221;: When the Roman General Pompeii led his legions into the land of Judea in 63 BC it was the beginning of a clash of cultures that grew into one of the most brutal conflicts in history. Terrorism, political assassination, starvation and crucifixion dominated the landscape, ending with the Roman sack of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD. From the aftermath, two new religions rose: rabbinical Judaism and Christianity. Episode 4. &#8220;The Gifts of the Jews&#8221;: In 132 AD Jewish zealots rebelled against Rome&#8217;s legions, forcing them to withdraw from the region. The Romans returned with a vast army, slaughtered nearly 600,000 Jews, changed the name of the region from Judea to Palestine and banned all Jews from Jerusalem. Many Jews fled to distant lands only to face another challenge - a breakaway form of Judaism called Christianity.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Kingdom of David: the saga of the Israelites [Widescreen]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Mitch Wilson, Carl Byker and Oregon Public Broadcasting</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 2003</p>", "description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Empires&#8221;.<br />\nKingdom of David: the saga of the Israelites is the story of one of the most profoundly influential religions, Judaism.

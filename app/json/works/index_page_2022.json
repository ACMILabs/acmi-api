Introduced as &#8220;a picture with a smile - perhaps a tear&#8221;, it proves to be just that. For while it will move people to uproarious laughter and keep them in a state of uneasing delight, it will also touch their hearts and win sympathy, not only for the star, but for its leading woman and little Jackie Coogan. The little tramp adopts an abandoned Kid in the slums of early New York city, where only the fittest can survive. There are characteristic &#8220;Chaplin touches&#8221;. A fine instance of imagination is where he dreams of Heaven. His slum alley is transformed into a bit of paradise, where everybody - including his nemesis, the cop, and a big bully are turned into angels! Includes an episode of those mischievious mites, The Young Rascals, entitled &#8220;Three men in a tub&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783836, "name": "Charles Chaplin", "creator_id": 10471, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783835, "name": "Thirtieth Cinemalux", "creator_id": 26044, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 783834, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39837", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1921", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1921"}], "labels": [23392]}, {"id": 78111, "acmi_id": "33899", "title": "The Kid who couldn't miss", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-kid-who-couldnt-miss", "creator_credit": "Paul Cowan and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1982", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/S3XC7PLNUNYKSyHJYpv9QAUZMu.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The Kid Who Couldn&#8217;t Miss has been the subject of controversy since its release in 1982.

No-one in the slums can afford another mouth to feed, but with the ever-watchful policeman around the corner, the tramp is unwittingly compelled to &#8220;adopt&#8221; the child. In classic style resembling the later &#8220;Gold Rush&#8221;, Chaplin shows his genius in bringing up baby, from inventing his own hysterical methods of changing nappies, to teaching the grown-up nine year old the art of survival, of self-defence, and earning a living- the Kid smashes windows, while Charlie repairs them cheap! A heart-warming story also unfolds, as the true mother stumbles upon her child - Coogan&#8217;s sensational performance made him the best-loved child star of the Golden Era! Cast also includes Edna Purviance, Chuck Riesner, Carl Miller, Henry Bergman. &#8220;Three men in a tub&#8221; - Alfalfa loses his girl to a smoothie with a yacht, but conspires with his friends to get her back.

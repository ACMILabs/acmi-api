Unfolding as a series of thirty-second vignettes, this enigmatic essay in style is characterized by a deadpan theatricality, symbolist imagery, surrealist juxtapositions and repetition of key visual motifs. Indelible images, precisely composed &#8212; a man teetering above a waterfall, a floating chair, a winking eye, a parrot against the New York skyline &#8212; are accompanied by an &#8216;architectural&#8217; sound score that includes spoken &#8216;phonetic patterns&#8217; rather than words. Fusing his surprising visual logic and rhythms with unexpected temporal manipulations, Wilson creates a work of startling wit and poetry.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816553, "name": "Robert Boner", "creator_id": 6453, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816552, "name": "Caroline Arrighi", "creator_id": 6452, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039251, "name": "Robert Wilson", "creator_id": 5221, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1039256, "name": "Film and Video Collectif and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF)", "creator_id": 6454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1039252, "name": "Allan Lloyd", "creator_id": 73173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1039253, "name": "Renato Berta", "creator_id": 73174, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "lighting", "role_id": 447, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "128", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}, {"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [47457], "external_references": []}]}

Michael is charmed by a girl named Star, and immediately falls in with a tough young gang led by David. It&#8217;s peer pressure in the extreme as Michael is tricked into drinking blood.

Middle Earth is now on the brink of a vicious war, and its fate rests on the shoulders of the &#8216;Fellowship&#8217;, now separated into three groups. Pulled by the ring&#8217;s power, Frodo heads towards Mount Doom with Sam, only to encounter an unlikely guide; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head towards Rohan; and Merry and Pippin find an ally in the terrifying Fangorn Forest. While this film culminates in two spectacular battles between the humans of Helm&#8217;s Deep and Saruman&#8217;s vicious minions and Saruman and the Ents, the tale twists and turns around numerous subplots and many new characters, including the twisted half-hobbit Gollum, a warped creature who will do anything to regain what he believes is rightfully his. Once again, Jackson and his screenwriters successfully reproduce a classic tale, which, unlike a number of blockbuster sequels, equals if not surpasses its predecessor, both enthralling and teasing the audience as the tale continues. Cast includes Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, John Rhys-Davies, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, Bernard Hill, David Wenham and Andy Serkis as the voice of Gollum.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Lord of the rings: the two towers special extended edition [DVD]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Barrie M Osborne and Wingnut Films</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>New Zealand, 2002</p>", "description": "<p>The fight between good and evil is played out using spectacular locations and stupendous special effects in &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, the second instalment of Peter Jackson&#8217;s iconic adaptation of J R R Tolkien&#8217;s fantasy epic, &#8220;The Lord of the rings&#8221;.

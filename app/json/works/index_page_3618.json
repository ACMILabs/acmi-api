This production by Achim Freyer was performed in Stuttgart by the Wurttemberg State Opera Chorus and Orchestra, with Ulrich Eistert as Chorus master and musical direction by Dennis Russell Davies. Romantic, melodramatic, evil and mystical, this German folkloric tale set in the Bohemian forest tells of a rivalry between Max (Toni Kramer) and Kaspar (Wolfgang Probst) over the hand of the beautiful young Agathe (Catarina Ligendza), daughter of Kuno (Fritz Linke) the head Ranger to Prince Ottokar. For Max to be worthy of marrying Agathe, he has to win the traditional shooting contest on his wedding morning. Kaspar has already sold his soul to the devil - will Max do the same? Using colorful set designs, costumes and make-up, this stage performance has a Grimm&#8217;s fairytale quality, albeit an adult fairytale. Cast also includes Wolfgang Schone and Raili Viljakainen. Sung in German with no English subtitles. Includes booklet with English translation.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884177, "name": "National Video Corporation", "creator_id": 23494, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884178, "name": "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen", "creator_id": 20976, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884179, "name": "Osterreichischer Rundfunk-Fernsehen", "creator_id": 15352, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884180, "name": "Achim Freyer", "creator_id": 36484, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884181, "name": "Hartmut Schottler", "creator_id": 36485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 884176, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [33983], "external_references": []}, {"id": 97906, "acmi_id": "507218", "title": "Depreciation and inflation (NP)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "depreciation-and-inflation-np", "creator_credit": "Video Arts and Peter Robinson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>John Cleese plays the foolhardy businessman who thinks he has had a successful year in his factory operation, unaware that inflation and depreciation of capital investment have been eating away at his profits.

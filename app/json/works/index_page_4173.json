The latest of these high risk ventures is an unofficial contract to paint miles of power towers on the remote and beautiful Yorkshire Moors. The group are an eclectic mix of ageing hippies and adrenalin seeking rock climbers, very laddish in their encounters with one another. Into this all male crew enters Gerry (Rachel Griffiths) a feisty, fearless, mountain climbing Australian backpacker, who upsets the working life and social order of the group. Gerry falls for her boss Ray (Pete Postlethwaite) fuelling problems for both of them with his ex-wife, and with his best friend, Steven. Tensions rise as racing against the clock, the crew strives to complete the job, whilst Ray and Gerry struggle to resolve the status of their relationship.

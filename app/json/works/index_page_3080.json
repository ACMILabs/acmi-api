Bobby is an eleven-year-old boy feeling the stigma of being from a financially strapped one-parent family. One summer a mysterious boarder Ted Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins) comes to live in the upstairs part of the house and wins over Bobby, if not his suspicious mother, Liz. It is gradually revealed that Ted has psychic powers and sinister men in dark suits are pursuing him. Bobby, in need of a father figure, is drawn into Ted&#8217;s confidence, working for him, and absorbing Ted&#8217;s wisdom.

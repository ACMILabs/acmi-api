Other thrillers of the period were as sharply directed and written, but few had the inestimable advantage of the sparks between Stroheim&#8217;s killer and Jouvet&#8217;s police chief. &#8216;L&#8217;alibi&#8217; is stylistically and thematically the closest of his [Chenal] films to the work of Carne and Prevert, he all but abandoned his habitual moving camera, while multiplying (studio shot) expressionistic effects of lighting and composition. Chenal has the dubious distinction of being the major filmmaker of the decade (1930s) most thoroughly forgotten by the film community after WWII for reason from which prejudice may not, perhaps, be excluded.&#8221;    Reference: Alan Williams. &#8220;Republic of Images: a history of French filmmaking&#8221;.

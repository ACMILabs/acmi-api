The program is also designed to assist students to develop understandings about the ways in which stories help us to make sense of the world and our place in that world. People all over the world tell stories in many different ways using oral, written and visual texts. This program and related activities enables students to share their experiences of story and to extend and refine their understandings by comparing a range of fairy tale and fantasy texts, analysing narrative structure and exploring animation and film adaptations of fairy tales.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:31:33:18"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Animation", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Literature&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 2225682, "name": "Carlton North Primary School", "creator_id": 73656, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "participants", "role_id": 622, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "12327", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2005", "notes": "18th July all day workshop", "to_year": "2005"}], "labels": [49465], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91647, "acmi_id": "314794", "title": "Fame", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fame", "creator_credit": "Allan Parker, Alan Marshall, David De Silva and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An energetic musical drama tracing the lives of eight talented teenagers who join Manhattan&#8217;s High School for the Performing Arts to train for show business careers.

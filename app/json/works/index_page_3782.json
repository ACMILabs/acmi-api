Classic elements of cinematographic style and action sequences are included in all their violent glory. The plot centres on a Bride&#8217;s (Uma Thurman) quest to exact revenge on those who prevented her from leaving the brutal world of the hired killer. Heavily pregnant and attending her wedding, all present at the church are massacred and she is shot in the head, leaving her in coma for four years. On recovering from the coma, the woman (Thurman) arms herself with a rare sword and goes about killing those who aimed to destroy her. We learn of the history of one of her most challenging opponents through the use of a detailed anime sequence - &#8220;The Origin of O-Ren&#8221; (Lucy Liu). Many are dead at the end of this film and the woman is only some way to crossing off the five people on her &#8220;Death List&#8221; - see also &#8220;Kill Bill Vol. 2&#8221;. Infused with the music, wit and humour of a Tarantino picture, &#8220;Kill Bill Vol. 1&#8221; is a classic revenge story with all of the requisite action sequences and fine storytelling. Cast includes Vivica A. Fox, Sonny Chiba, Chiaki Kuriyama, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks, Julia Dreyfus, Michael Bowen, Jun Kunimura, Kenji Oba, Yuki Kazamatsuri, James Parks, Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen.

Unfortunately, like everything else in Sunnydale High, gateway to the hellmouth, Oz has teen issues of the supernatural kind (Ep. 15, Phases). Love is also in the air for Zander (Nicholas Brendan) as he hooks up with the &#8216;cliquey&#8217; Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), an unlikely paring which results in much bitchy repartee (Ep. 10, What&#8217;s my line, Part two). Aside from a new slayer unexpectedly arriving on the scene (Ep. 9, What&#8217;s my line, Part One), season two&#8217;s biggest surprise ended up being the transformation of Buffy&#8217;s &#8216;soulful&#8217; vampire boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz) into the uber evil, Angelus (Ep. 13, Surprise and Ep. 14, Innocence). This causes the love struck Buffy much grief as she has to make some difficult and painful decisions (Ep. 22, Becoming, Part two). Meanwhile, Angelus makes it his personal mission to make the slayer&#8217;s life hell (Ep. 17, Passion), while joining forces with Spike and Drusilla as they attempt to awaken a demon that will suck the world into hell (Ep. 21, Becoming, Part one and Eps. 22, Becoming, Part two). Cast includes: Sarah Michele Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, Anthony Stewart Head.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["09:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Closed captioning", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1118153, "name": "Josh Whedon", "creator_id": 34623, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1118152, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1118151, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115536, "acmi_id": "S01364", "title": "Buffy the vampire slayer", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "buffy-the-vampire-slayer", "creator_credit": "Gareth Davies and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 89944, "acmi_id": "312834", "title": "Angel.

They enjoy the afternoon together, but, as always, it comes to a sad and abrupt end. Songsong begins to resent both of his parents for their divorce. Later that evening, Songsong attempts to visit his mother again, but is shocked and upset to find her with another man. He runs away crying. She chases after him, but he escapes her and is caught in the rain. He becomes ill and is taken to hospital, his parents waiting in worry. The doctor tells them that Songsong has gone into shock, who beg him to save the boy. The parents desperately promise to be there for him, but Songsong appears extremely weak. The scene fades out, and we are unsure whether Songsong lives or not.

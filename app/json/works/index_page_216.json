Sethe&#8217;s history is revealed in a series of brief flashback sequences: her rape, torture, escape, birth of her children, and witnessing of despicable deeds wrought upon her family. Living with her young daughter, Denver, Sethe is visited by a friend from the past Paul D (Danny Glover). Paul and Sethe were slaves on the same plantation and share knowledge of the evil wrought upon each other and their families. Paul and Sethe seek a kind of peace together, cautiously unburdening their darkest memories. Into Sethe&#8217;s house one day, arrives the mysterious, beautiful Beloved (Thandie Newton) a young woman who has, by turns, a menacing and sweet demeanour. Beloved strikes a bond with Sethe and Denver, whilst resenting Paul.

When big-time racketeer Ben Tucker (Roy Roberts) gets Joe to assist him in controlling the New York numbers game, Joe has to put the career and life of his own brother, Leo (Thomas Gomez), in jeopardy. This forces Joe into having to decide between the seduction of big money and loyalty to his brother. From this minimalist film-noir plot, Polonsky has fashioned a dark fable about the American Dream.

This doumentary tells the true story behind the discovery of penicillin, the wonder drug of the twentieth century, which would change the face of modern civilisation by providing a cure for medical scourges such as pneumonia, meningitis, rheumatic fever, septicaemia and venereal diseases. Using dramatic re-enactments, &#8220;Penicillin : the magic bullet&#8221; charts the work of the Howard Florey&#8217;s team (including that of the overlooked Norman Heatley) as they struggled towards this medical breakthrough. Narrated by Martin Jacobs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Bacteriology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Chain, Ernst, Sir, 1906-1979", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fleming, Alexander, 1881-1955", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Florey, Howard, Baron Florey, 1898-1968", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Heatley, Norman George, 1911-2004", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine - History", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Penicillin", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Bacteriology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chain, Ernst, Sir, 1906-1979", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Fleming, Alexander, 1881-1955", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Florey, Howard, Baron Florey, 1898-1968", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Heatley, Norman George, 1911-2004", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Nobel Prizes", "People&nbsp;→ Chain, Ernst, Sir, 1906-1979", "People&nbsp;→ Fleming, Alexander, 1881-1955", "People&nbsp;→ Florey, Howard, Baron Florey, 1898-1968", "People&nbsp;→ Heatley, Norman George, 1911-2004", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 930919, "name": "Gordon Glenn", "creator_id": 16194, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091446", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930917, "name": "Claire Jager", "creator_id": 21587, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143697", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930918, "name": "Gordon Glenn", "creator_id": 16194, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091446", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930916, "name": "Arcimedia", "creator_id": 37770, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53737", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [35097]}, {"id": 89893, "acmi_id": "312777", "title": "Penguin Island", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "penguin-island", "creator_credit": "Australia.

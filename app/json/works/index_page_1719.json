But as the series progresses, the ever watchful eye of the Feds becomes less important than the personal experiences of the New Jersey crime family. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is still in therapy and though he is still baiting psychoanalyst Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), he is getting closer to understanding the source of his anxiety attacks: they are triggered by memories of his violent childhood. But with the death of his mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), Tony has to deal with the twin demons of rage and guilt. Tony also has to deal with his daughter Meadow&#8217;s awakening sexuality (including her falling in love with a black man) as well as with the spiritual angst of his wife, Carmella (Edie Falco), who is increasingly disturbed by the ethical implications of her being a partner to a mobster. It&#8217;s only when he meets the beautiful Gloria (Annabella Sciorra) that things start looking up for Tony, but soon, in true Soprano&#8217;s style, her emotional instability creates a dangerous domestic situation for him. Outstanding episodes in this series include &#8220;Employee of the month&#8221;, which deals with the rape of Dr. Melfi, the black comedy of &#8220;Pine barrens&#8221;, directed by Steve Buscemi, and the horrifying violence of &#8220;University&#8221; which features the abusive relationship between a mobster and one of the strippers at the Bada Bing. The dark exploration of masculinity, abuse and violence which is central to this episode exemplifies what is unique to The Sopranos: terrific writing, outstanding performances and a daring audacity to fully explore the brutality of contemporary culture.

This episode, &#8220;Commendatori&#8221; is a series highlight, revolving around the glaring discrepancies between the Italo-American conceptions of the &#8220;old country&#8221; and the realities of contemporary Europe. Other outstanding episodes in series two include &#8220;D-Girl&#8221; where Christopher (Michael Imperioli) finds hidden talents as an actor and &#8220;Knight in white satin armour&#8221; where the tensions between Janie, Ritchie and Tony resolve in a violent and unexpected manner. But every episode in this adult cynical series is of excellent value.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["13:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in television", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Depression, Mental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychiatry", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2475446, "name": "Allen Coulter", "creator_id": 80740, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q423052", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475451, "name": "Henry J.

WARNING: CONTAINS GRAPHIC IMAGES OF EXTREME FIGHT SCENES.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Dan Bigras, Canadian singer and filmmaker, features in his own documentary along with his extreme fighter friends, Charles Ali Nestor (27 y.o.), David Loiseau (21 y.o.) and Steve Vigneault (22 y.o.) to demonstrate that an outlet can be found for those who find themselves battling with self-destructive impulses or overwhelming uncontrollable anger and rage. Where Bigras uses singing and song-writing as his outlet, his friends prefer to channel their energies into martial arts and extreme fighting as a way of rebuilding their lives. It would seem a common thread runs through the lives of each of these young men as they tell their stories of an unhappy childhood, bullying, teenage gangs, violence and family break-down. But the frankness and honesty in their personal tales and the friendship, loyalty and support between the four men in their collective struggle to transform their anger into a rage for life is what really defines this film, not the fighting scenes - their courage is to be admired. Features interviews with families, friends, sporting personnel and other extreme fighters and includes graphic coverage of bouts from competition fights and training sessions.

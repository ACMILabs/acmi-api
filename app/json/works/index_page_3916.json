With his mates and his twin brother by his side, Barry enlists the help of Australian ambassador Sir Alec Ferguson (Ed Deveraux dressed perpetually in baggy shorts and long socks) and a daring rescue mission is launched. After the successful rescue mission, Barry and Edna are repatriated back to Australia where they are welcomed at Sydney airport by the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and his wife Margaret (playing themselves). The film was one of the few Australian features after 1970 to be made without government money. This DVD re-release of the second Barry McKenzie film, is packaged to highlight the retro appeal of seventies &#8216;ocker&#8217; comedy. Written by Barry Humphries and Bruce Beresford ; photography, Don McAlpine ; music, Peter Best. Cast includes Barry Crocker, Barry Humphries, Donald Pleasence, Dick Bentley, Ed Deveraux, Roy Kinnear, Frank Windsor, Clive James, Gough and Margaret Whitlam.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Motion picture sequels", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Best, Pete, 1941-", "People&nbsp;→ Best, Pete, 1941-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963927, "name": "Reg Grundy Productions", "creator_id": 34288, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963928, "name": "Bruce Beresford", "creator_id": 13900, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963926, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52261", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1974", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1974"}], "labels": [33867], "external_references": [{"id": 3551, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "24085"}]}, {"id": 94908, "acmi_id": "318937", "title": "Barry Humphries' flashbacks [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "barry-humphries-flashbacks-dvd", "creator_credit": "Flashback Films, ABC-TV (Australia), John McLean and David Mitchell", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1998", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Entertainer and self confessed cultural historian Barry Humphries takes the viewer on a voyage of discovery into Australian society in the 1950s, 60s, 70s and 80s.

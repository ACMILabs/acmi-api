With the unwelcome mantle of ‘most locked-down city in the world’, Melbourne audiences were at the forefront of artist Laura Duffy’s mind when she created <i>Spawn</i>. Duffy mixes materials together like potions, encouraging audiences to consider texture through filmic spaces in which the natural and unnatural writhe upon one another – slipping, dripping, bubbling, congealing.</p>\n<p>Responsive to a context of global pandemic mixed in with climate crisis, Duffy is moved by sentiments of kindness and generosity, inviting audiences into the ‘poetic, fun, fresh, flowery, camp and flirty’ world of <i>Spawn</i>.</p>\n<p>The work reflects Duffy’s belief that materials are collaborative, complete with their own stories, histories and energies. The artist combines these materials to critique and shatter binary thinking of natural and unnatural as separate, instead embracing the complexity and blur of binaries. ‘How are we able to unleash from the constraints of “nature” to find new pleasures? A Post-nature embrace of all that is and will be, even if it&#8217;s toxic?’ Duffy questions.</p>\n<p><i>Spawn</i> is also a work about gratitude. A filmic study of death and transformation. As golden liquid pours over rotting, spinning fruits and flowers, Duffy encourages us to ‘say thank you and rejoice in transformation and transmutation.’</p>\n<p>An additional element of the work will be released in January 2022. Conscious that so many of us have been confined to our homes and tied to our screens, Duffy is collaborating with artist and friend Aliyah Winter to create a downloadable audio work that we can walk around with, enjoying at our leisure, wherever we please.</p>\n<p>– Serena Bentley, Curator, ACMI</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>What do freak-science, fairies and queer flower coding have in common?</p>\n<p>These themes intersect in a new experimental video work by Te Whanganui A-Tara based artist Laura Duffy. &#8220;Spawn&#8221; explores political underpinnings of categorisations of ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ in relation to bodies.

Taught by action stars but inspired by classic Chinese texts like Lao Zi&#8217;s &#8220;Dao De Jing&#8221;, he questions whether these life lessons are genuinely useful. Phu is aware of how wisdom can be oversimplified and misused, how film subtitles miss the mark or even present a completely different narrative, and how we are guided in our day-to-day life by the movies we watch.</p>\n<p>Leading Melbourne-based visual artist Jason Phu&#8217;s multi-disciplinary practice includes printmaking, installation, painting and video. Born in 1989 in Sydney, Australia, Phu lives and works in Melbourne, Australia. Phu&#8217;s artworks often explore Chinese histories in Australia, his own family history, and Chinese/Vietnamese folktales. Jason Phu is the 2021 recipient of the Mordant Family Moving Image Commission for young Australian artists.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Jason Phu<br />\nThree-channel video installation, 85 mins.<br />\nEdited by Conor Bateman<br />\nMordant Family Moving Image Commission, ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Three-channel video, colour and sound"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 639}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1431199, "name": "Jason Phu", "creator_id": 86084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1431200, "name": "Conor Bateman", "creator_id": 84346, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "186546", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2021", "notes": "", "to_year": "2021"}], "labels": [59205]}, {"id": 119665, "acmi_id": "B2004413", "title": "[The funeral of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-funeral-of-field-marshal-sir-thomas-blamey", "creator_credit": "Unknown", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1951", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1951-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film contains documentary footage of the state funeral of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, which took place on 30 May, 1951 in Melbourne, Victoria.</p>\n<p>The film captures the funeral cortege as it proceeds along Swanston Street, with crowds of people lining the streets and buildings.

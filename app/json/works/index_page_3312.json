This leads to an explanation of the development of cyclones in the North Atlantic, and their drift towards these islands, Finally, the film illustrates Great Britains; position in relations to sea and air communications.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:38:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Climate", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Cyclones", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Places&nbsp;→ Great Britain", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 852384, "name": "Gaumont", "creator_id": 70108, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 852385, "name": "Frank Wells", "creator_id": 12353, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 852386, "name": "Derek Mayne", "creator_id": 12722, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

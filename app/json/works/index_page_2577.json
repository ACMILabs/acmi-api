This program sets out to dispel the myths and misunderstandings by taking the viewer into the homes, mosques and work places of American Muslims (6-7 million in America, many who have immigrated from Iraq during the Gulf War) who openly talk of their faith, and their beliefs and values that shape their lives, commenting that fanaticism and acts of terrorism are contrary to the beliefs of Islam. Shot on location in the Middle East, Europe and the United States, this documentary program took three years to complete but the result is probably one of the most comprehensive chronicles produced on the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the Islamic religion. Narrated by Andre Braugher.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Immigrants - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Jihad", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - Religious aspects", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Arabs - Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cultural relativism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Faith", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Faith and reason", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Jihad", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Koran", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Muslims", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Philosophy and religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prejudices", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and state", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religions - Comparative studies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social integration - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Foreign relations", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Prejudices", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Stereotype (Psychology)", "History&nbsp;→ Arabs - History", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Jihad", "History&nbsp;→ Middle East - History", "History&nbsp;→ Muhammad, Prophet, d. 632", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History - 21st century", "People&nbsp;→ Muhammad, Prophet, d. 632", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 916132, "name": "Kikim Media", "creator_id": 36638, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916133, "name": "Unity Productions Foundation", "creator_id": 36639, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916134, "name": "KQED-TV (Television station : San Francisco, Calif.)", "creator_id": 12313, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916135, "name": "Alexander Kronemer", "creator_id": 80889, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916136, "name": "Michael Wolfe", "creator_id": 80890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916137, "name": "Michael Schwarz", "creator_id": 80891, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916138, "name": "Liz Gray", "creator_id": 80530, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916139, "name": "Michael Schwarz", "creator_id": 80891, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916140, "name": "Omar Al-Qattan", "creator_id": 36118, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 916131, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

In this incisive documentary, the history of rap and hip-hop is explored as well as the larger social context of American race and class relations. Interviews with Ice-T, Queen latifah, KRS-One, Chuck D and Rakim explore the context of rap&#8217;s evolution and offer necessary defences of the music&#8217;s relevance and importance to African-American youth; especially in the context of a popular media that has often dismissed rap as misogynist or &#8220;inauthentic&#8221;. Made by two Australian brothers who fell in love with the music, this documentary gives a voice to the power, impact, originality and importance of rap and hip-hop.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap musicians", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 788059, "name": "Elliott Productions", "creator_id": 26939, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788060, "name": "Burberry Productions", "creator_id": 26940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788061, "name": "Stephen Elliott", "creator_id": 73402, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788062, "name": "Grant Elliott", "creator_id": 73401, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 788058, "name": "AFI [au]", "creator_id": 9711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-1 Digital File - 2MB Rate; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41014", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [24528], "external_references": []}, {"id": 99306, "acmi_id": "509513", "title": "Raoul Wallenberg: between the lines [Edited version]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "raoul-wallenberg-between-the-lines-edited-version", "creator_credit": "Jethro Films Pty Ltd, Bob Weis and Karin Altmann", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1985", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The story of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat living in wartime Budapest who displayed outstanding courage and ingenuity in rescuing Jews from the holocaust.

And really, it looks like it&#8217;s a cycle of about every 10 years that someone decides, well, it&#8217;s time that we had another go, so. I&#8217;ve been involved in the three premierships that we have won and involved again at the moment. Balranald&#8217;s a town of 1,400 people. Virtually impossible to keep the young people here. So it makes it pretty hard that way.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>-To get the success&#8212; and I mean, the great form of success&#8212; you&#8217;ve got to bring some players in. And I&#8217;m not being derogative to our boys, but we just haven&#8217;t got the overall talent and the numbers of talented players to win a flag.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>All Central Murray clubs would be spending, at the moment&#8212; the majority of them, anyway, the successful ones, say, 6 or 8 of the top 12, would spend in excess of $100,000 a year on players alone.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>GRAHAM &#8220;JOCK&#8221; CAMPBELL:  It&#8217;s not unreasonable to pay players, $700, $800, $900, or $1,000 a game to be competitive. I have contributed large sums of money. But we&#8217;ve certainly done our homework. We&#8217;ve gone around metro Melbourne and Mildura and hand-picked the players that we reckoned wood do the job.</p>\n<p>[PLAYERS SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>MERV NEAGLE:  I think after the &#8216;94 Premiership, this club won 14 games in 10 years. You know, I mean, and you get sick of it. You don&#8217;t want to go along and the players get sick of it. The all the supporters get sick of it.</p>\n<p>So when all of a sudden, they decided, OK let&#8217;s have another crack at it, it&#8217;s just like a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? OK, we&#8217;ve got a good side. We&#8217;re going to win. Let&#8217;s go to the footy.</p>\n<p>And the whole town on a Saturday when the team plays away&#8212; like we went to Tooleybuc on Saturday. You could have fired a gun up the Main Street of this town and you wouldn&#8217;t have hit anyone. There&#8217;s just a different hype around the place when your football side&#8217;s winning. That&#8217;s how important it is to the town, you know?</p>\n<p>So at the moment, all&#8217;s&#8212; well, we were runners-up last year. And hopefully we have a side good enough to go one step better this year.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>ROB BARRETT: A lot of people don&#8217;t like what we do. And I mean, that&#8217;s the jealousy thing comes into it. And yeah, each time that we&#8217;ve one a premiership, there&#8217;s been money involved. So you do tend to get that. Oh, well, they bought a premiership. Yeah, there&#8217;s a fair bit of feeling comes about. I mean, yeah, you talk about these country teams and country footy clubs, money&#8217;s a big thing.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The value of winning</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Malcolm McKinnon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Victoria, Australia, 2007</p>", "description": "<p>To combat a declining number of players in the local community and to add talent to their team, many football clubs are buying in star players to boost their chance of winning a flag.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Graham Campbell, Rob Barrett, and Merv Neagle.

We used to get dressed in the Spargo hotel. Had to wade across through the creek, which you can see down the bottom there, get our feet nice and wet. If you were up there playing fullback or full-forward, and the ball was down this end, you could not see which side had the ball.</p>\n<p>There was a big hump in the middle of the ground, and the only way you could fathom it out was which direction the ball was travelling. And on one wing, we used to have to wade through ferns to get the ball.</p>\n<p>There was rabbits all around the area at those times, and it was often when we were crossing the creek, there&#8217;d be rabbits running around everywhere.

And often the ball would hit that, and if you were standing on the wire, you were surprised when you found yourself you had the ball.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>DON DUUS: I don&#8217;t know whether the Chewton fullback knew he could hit the lines, but he hit them very, very regular. And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on. And of course, if the umpire told us that we could play on if the power lines were hit, we used to play on and kick goals, much to the annoyance of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The Harcourt was pretty bad. It had a big creek running down one side of it. And many a player&#8217;s disappeared down the creek. Kyneton was a little bit difficult.

be the Mallee stump. The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling. It always has been. And yeah, always will be.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Because we didn&#8217;t have any social club rooms at the time to store any of our memorabilia, everything was stored at the pub. And as different publicans come and go, some don&#8217;t like the memorabilia that apparently collects dust, and so he decided he&#8217;d clean the place out. And I went past one day and he was heading out to the tip with all of this football memorabilia in the back of his Ute.</p>\n<p>And so I quickly went in and grabbed the lot. And I&#8217;ve still got a fair bit of it, but it&#8217;s all there for the football club, for the future. And it&#8217;s interesting how some people just don&#8217;t value these things that others really think are fairly precious.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I just think, mainly because of where we live, in the middle of the Mallee, it was called the Mallee Footy League, and we end up with a trophy made out of a Mallee stump, you can&#8217;t get much more significant than that.

And you&#8217;ve got to work hard at it. We used to have a lot of fun, but we never won many games.</p>\n<p>[HORN BLOWING]</p>\n<p>So we turned it around. And that&#8217;s why in the last 20 years we&#8217;ve won premierships. In the &#8216;80s, the cash was $2,000. That was big money. And we could rise up with&#8212; we took raffles and dinner dances and things like that. And then in the &#8216;90s when we were just struggling, we realized we had no money. We have to do something better. And that&#8217;s when we first started wrestling the Harley Davidsons. Four of the committee rang up together and all put in, and we brought a motorbike. And from then on, it was just full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>[MOTOR RUNNING]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: I see our biggest challenge as being fundraising, because we have a pretty clear idea of what we are going to get from a go at the Canteen and the bar. And that&#8217;s enough to cover our expenses. But it&#8217;s not enough to do anything with new buildings. It&#8217;s not enough to repair our fairly basic amenities. We can&#8217;t send players on trips and things like that. We cannot afford to pay our player&#8217;s memberships. We have to ask them to pay, that sort of thing. I&#8217;ve really got to watch all the costs.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>DERRY MONAGHAN: They certainly all pick [INAUDIBLE] stumps. And not for a while they haven&#8217;t, but we did that at [INAUDIBLE] just to try and get a couple of extra players each year. And the local boys here cut wood to source money for the football trip.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>The main source of income is the Vic Grain Bunkers. We have the contract to empty them the [INAUDIBLE] Bunkers. And when we get enough trucks, we can make a lot of money. And that&#8217;s how we source the money to run the club. Now it&#8217;s one in, all in, and from me, down to the players.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: Really, the things that keep small country towns going are your pub, your football team, and your primary school.

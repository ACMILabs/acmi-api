Philip Kaufman (The Unbearable lightness of being, Henry and June, The Right stuff) presents the Marquis de Sade as a mostly harmless presence (ignoring his historical squalidity) - compared to the enshrined corruption within the Church. Kaufman ably captures the fetid environs of the asylum; the barely contained carnal desires of the inmates, their depravity and insanity, inflaming the nightmarish atmosphere of these scenes. Rush puts in an impressive, if manic, performance as a tormented artist, whose prose may inspire acts of passion and murder witnessed throughout the film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Closed captioning", "Erotica", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Insanity", "Historical films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Authors - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Authors - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 928463, "name": "Fox Searchlight Pictures", "creator_id": 72572, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928464, "name": "Hollywood Partners", "creator_id": 35862, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928465, "name": "Industry Entertainment", "creator_id": 35863, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928466, "name": "Walrus and Associates", "creator_id": 25280, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928467, "name": "Julia Chasma", "creator_id": 80548, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928468, "name": "Peter Kaufman", "creator_id": 21177, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928469, "name": "Nick Wechsler", "creator_id": 3948, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 928470, "name": "Philip Kaufman", "creator_id": 24130, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 928462, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51805", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33455]}]}

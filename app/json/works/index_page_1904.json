Enjoying a cult following, the program (now in its second series) produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops.

First stop for Andrew MacKenzie in this episode is 80 Gold Street, a gallery run by director Ellie Young that focuses on photography made by using alternative processes. Interviewed is artist John P. Pollard who discusses the Gum Bichromate process discovered by Poitenin in 1855. Zara Stanhope curates &#8220;Release&#8221;, an exhibition of New Zealand photography.

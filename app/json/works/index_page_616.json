His suspect theatre expertise ranges from off-off Broadway to a disastrous production of &#8220;Backdraft - The Musical&#8221;. The cast for &#8220;Blaine - The Musical&#8221; is filled out by a small group of inept but keen town locals whose enthusiasm far surpasses their talent. The mainly ensemble cast are spot on with their small town counterparts, particularly Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the screenplay with Guest), as local dentist Dr. Allan Pearl, who wins the lead despite his lazy eye and wobbly singing voice. Rounding up the cast is the wonderful Parker Posey as the bored Dairy Queen shop girl, and husband and wife Sheila and Ron (Catherine O&#8217;Hara and Fred Willard), the seasoned pro&#8217;s with an eye for broadway. If things weren&#8217;t bad enough, word gets out that influential Broadway theatre critic Mr. Guffman is coming to opening night, raising the stakes for the amateur crew.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Critics", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Mockumentary", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Critics", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Critics", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Critics", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960390, "name": "Castle Rock Entertainment", "creator_id": 52854, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960391, "name": "Karen Murphy", "creator_id": 4007, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960392, "name": "Christopher Guest", "creator_id": 79769, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49781", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [31828]}, {"id": 74446, "acmi_id": "011621", "title": "Waiting for Fidel", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "waiting-for-fidel", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Tom Daly and Michael Rubbo", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1974", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Joseph Smallwood, former Newfoundland Premier, Geoff Stirling, radio and television station owner, and Michael Rubbo, NFBC film director, visit Cuba to make a film in which they hope Fidel Castro will star.

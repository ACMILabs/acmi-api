Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken play lawman and hitman on opposite sides of the struggle, who share the love of Ella, played by Isabelle Huppert. The original film was cut by 70 minutes and was never acclaimed in the United States as it was in Europe. This version is presented in its entirety and has compelling performances by the supporting cast of John Hurt, Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston and locational shoots of breathtaking beauty.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/heavens-gate", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1988342, "name": "Michael Cimino", "creator_id": 77662, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q59129", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988341, "name": "Joan Carell", "creator_id": 26516, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q75189137", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1988340, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q219400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1988339, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40536", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [24071]}]}

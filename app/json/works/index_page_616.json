The plight of these refugees is graphically illustrated through film footage and interviews with Montserrat Felix (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), Francesc Vendrell (United Nations mediator), Taliban representatives including Ebdul Salam Zaeef (Ambassador of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in Pakistan) and several Afghani women refugees. Also covers a brief history of Afghanistan from 1978 onwards when Afghanistan was invaded by Soviet forces. Suitable for senior secondary and tertiary students. Teacher notes included.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Filmed just prior to the September 11 disaster, this documentary provides an inside look at the humanitarian crisis building on the Afghani/Pakistan borders where Afghani refugees were seeking shelter from drought and war and the oppressive regime of the Taliban.

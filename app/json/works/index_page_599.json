A remarkable sequence of (unarmed) indigenous peasants in Mexico taking over an army base; a Korean perspective on the rise of the new global economic orthodoxy and the resistance to it; the &#8216;no borders&#8217; movement in Europe and Australia against the deportation and detention of refugees.<br />\nAdverts peppered throughout the program are actually &#8216;subverts&#8217; - biting satirical 30-second statements about consumerism, gender, sexuality and possibilities for reshaping the world. Producers of this form range from disaffected advertisers to teenagers with an ironic message about climate change.<br />\nThe Global Insights videos have seen hundreds of free public screenings from Tamil Nadu to Antarctica - inspiring grass-roots people&#8217;s action and fostering an independent and accessible screen culture globally.<br />\nGlobal Insights is put together on a miniscule budget by volunteers. It is a collaboration between hundreds of independent media makers around the world.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White", "Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1863831, "name": "SKA TV", "creator_id": 7339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863830, "name": "Tom McKendrick", "creator_id": 81885, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863829, "name": "Campbell Manderson", "creator_id": 7341, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863828, "name": "Ntennis Davi", "creator_id": 8905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863826, "name": "Ntennis Davi", "creator_id": 8905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1863827, "name": "Ntennis Davi", "creator_id": 8905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "curator", "role_id": 501, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2036", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [53615], "external_references": []}, {"id": 109155, "acmi_id": "B1004947", "title": "Tales from two schools", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "tales-from-two-schools", "creator_credit": "Paul Fletcher", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Work created by students from Tarnagulla and Marong primary schools with animator Paul Fletcher as part of the Artists in Schools Project sponsored by the Department of Education and Arts Victoria.

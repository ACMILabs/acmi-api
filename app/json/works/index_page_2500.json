Ninotchka, a stern lady Communist (Charisse) comes to Paris to retrieve three wayward comrades (Peter Lorre, Jules Munshin, Joseph Buloff) and a Russian composer (George Tobias). Much to her surprise, she is seduced by the trappings of capitalism in the form of champagne, silk stockings and a suave American producer (Fred Astaire), all of which contradict her Communist sensibilities. Includes songs such as: &#8220;Fated to be mated&#8221;, &#8220;All of you&#8221;, &#8220;The Ritz Rock and Roll&#8221;, &#8220;Silk stockings&#8221;, &#8220;Red blues&#8221;, &#8220;Josephine&#8221; and &#8220;Stereophonic sound&#8221;. Music and lyrics by Cole Porter. Screenplay by Leonard Gershe and Leonard Spigelgass.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture remakes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Motion picture remakes", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2300355, "name": "Rouben Mamoulian", "creator_id": 70852, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51472", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2300354, "name": "Arthur Freed", "creator_id": 3446, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q709413", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2300346, "name": "Arthur Freed Productions", "creator_id": 78652, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2300345, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2300359, "name": "Cyd Charisse", "creator_id": 76842, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q62558", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2300357, "name": "Fred Astaire", "creator_id": 76474, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q100937", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2300341, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44355", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [27290]}, {"id": 87798, "acmi_id": "309882", "title": "Mars attacks!", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mars-attacks", "creator_credit": "Tim Burton, Larry Franco and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown, 1996", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47476, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q271690"}], "brief_description": "<p>Science fiction and cult movie fans will warm to Tim Burton&#8217;s distinct brand of humour in this sci-fi spoof where, once again, Earth is invaded by martians.

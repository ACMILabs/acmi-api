For a contemporary viewer it is the richly colourful cinematography and the epic reconstruction of Renaissance Rome which is the film&#8217;s long-lasting legacy. If the melodrama of the clashes between the tortured artist and the meglomaniac Pope now seem almost camp, the recreation of the feat of painting the vast Chapel still seems wondrous.

They also organised an other team to document the Paris uprising of 1944. This episode concludes with an evocation of &#8216;Les portes de la nuit&#8217;<em> (1945) as the first film of the Liberation (or at least, one that best captured the atmosphere of 1945). Within the film community, the wide range of responses to the moral dilemmas of the Occupation makes it difficult to draw any firm, unambiguous line of demarcation betwen heroes and villains (or dupes). The situation was very different for a Guy de Carmoy, an active supporter of the Resistance, than for a Marcel Carne, who at much less risk gave jobs to old friends in defiance of the ban on Jewish filmmakers. Many others did neither, but they also did not send anonymous letters to Gestapo headquarters in Paris nor include anti-Semitic propaganda in their films. Outside of the industry, particularly in radio and print journalism, standards of conduct were, sadly, much lower. If, after the Liberation, relatively few filmmakers could truthfully boast of heroic exploits during the Occupation, the industry as a whole could find a measure of justification - however limited it might seem in retrospect - in having collectively refused to embrace the madness which surrounded it.&#8221; Reference: Alan Williams. &#8216;Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking&#8217;.

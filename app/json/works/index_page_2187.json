the sounds of a children’s choir practicing their scales accompanied by the sounds of a piano and the voice of a teacher, barely discernable amid the music. My September unfolds across pivotal days of that month in the lead up to the Asian Games. The narrative begins by introducing multiple story strands and a high level of activity, enhanced by the use of a mobile camera filming in the labyrinth of laneways that make up this area of Beijing. The film is set at Elm Street School, in the laneways and in the small homes that surround a courtyard where neighbours share a tap and watermelon on hot days.

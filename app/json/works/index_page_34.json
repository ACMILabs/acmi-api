This masterful film by John Huston, directed late in his career, is one of his finest works. Brad Dourif plays an alienated young ex-serviceman who wishes to create a new form of Church which preaches religion without salvation. On his perverse Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress through the underbelly of the Southern United States, he is taken up as a religious saviour by a range of unscrupulous con-men who are only to willing to exploit him for financial gain. Absurd and blackly comic, &#8220;Wise Blood&#8221; paints a disturbing picture of the twisted relationship between religion and politics in the United States. Released on the eve of Reagan&#8217;s election to President, this film questions the combination of religious hysteria, unashamed materialism and deliberate ignorance of fundamentalism.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Flannery O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s first novel was a mesmerising and almost hallucinigenic satire of deep-South Christian fundamentalism.

For four years, the intrepid crew of the classic television sci-fi series, Galaxy Quest, zoomed around the galaxy in their ship, the NSEA Protector, embarking on perilous missions, and battling hostile life forms. Twenty years later, at the Eighteenth Galaxy Quest convention, the show&#8217;s original stars are still squeezing into their costumes, and resignedly preparing for yet another meet and greet with their die-hard fans. Arriving late, actor Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen), or &#8220;Commander Peter Quincy Taggart&#8221; to his fan base, manages to earn the disapproval of his castmates after they accuse him of taking paid work without them. Upset at being rejected, irritated by the undying attention of his fans, and fed up with his lack of career prospects, Nesmith storms out of the conference to go on a drinking binge. The next day, the group of pale, black-clad &#8220;aliens&#8221; who sought him out at the convention arrive at his hilltop condominium, claiming to require his help. Hung over, and believing it to be a paying acting job, Nesmith agrees to go with them. However, only when he is teleported to their ship, and asked to negotiate with a ruthless alien adversary does he grasp the true nature of the situation.

Effectively utilising the confines of the barrack as an incendiary setting for pent up frustrations, Wilder successfully explores the mob mentality in a compelling manner; less compelling (at least dramatically) are the humorous moments operating as light relief which stagnate the drama, diluting the well crafted tension. &#8220;Stalag 17&#8221; was one of the first films to convey war with humour - a definite precursor to &#8220;M<em>A</em>S<em>H</em>&#8221;, &#8220;Catch-22&#8221; and the campy outlandishness of &#8220;Hogan&#8217;s Heroes&#8221;. William Holden won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the embittered Sefton - a role he apparently reluctantly played. Cast includes Don Taylor, Otto Preminger, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Peter Graves, Richard Erdman, Sig Rumann and Neville Brand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Croatian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Italian", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Romanian", "Slovenian", "Spanish", "Spanish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Prisoners of war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers - United States", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Germany", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Closed captioning", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/stalag-17", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963999, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964000, "name": "Billy Wilder", "creator_id": 56081, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963998, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52331", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [33921], "external_references": [{"id": 1187, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1356753"}, {"id": 5471, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "632"}]}, {"id": 85461, "acmi_id": "306860", "title": "Stage Fright", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stage-fright", "creator_credit": "Warner Brothers First National Productions and Alfred Hitchcock", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1950", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1950-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Drama student Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) envisions the acting challenge of a lifetime in the desperate predicament of boyfriend Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) who is framed for murder by the flamboyant stage star Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich).

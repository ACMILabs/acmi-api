In the film Fritz&#8217;s affair with the baroness has more or less ended and the couple&#8217;s expression of undying love (not entirely cynical on his part), is threatened by the baron&#8217;s vengefulness - the portrayal, in the play, of innocence destroyed by cynical players in a decadent society gives way to Ophuls&#8217; atmospheric portrayal of love doomed by hollow class distinction and hidebound notions of honour. Cast includes Magda Schneider, Wolfgang Liebeneiner and Gustaf Grundgens.

As in &#8220;House of Games&#8221; (1987), Mamet&#8217;s first film as a director, the elaborate con game visited on the innocent victim in &#8220;The Spanish Prisoner&#8221; completely shatters their sense of equilibrium. Trust proves Joe&#8217;s undoing, faith in humanity his tragic flaw. As with many other of Mamet&#8217;s films, an underlying theme running throughout the film is that of the immorality of the corporate world that rewards those who act ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics. Cast also includes Ben Gazzara, Felicity Huffman and Rebecca Pidgeon.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Espionage", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-spanish-prisoner", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1971520, "name": "David Mamet", "creator_id": 24485, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q269927", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971519, "name": "Jean Doumanian", "creator_id": 29398, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6170556", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971518, "name": "Jean Doumanian Productions", "creator_id": 31664, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1971517, "name": "Sweetland Films BV", "creator_id": 27595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46872", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [29214], "external_references": []}, {"id": 89723, "acmi_id": "312570", "title": "The Dinner game = Le Diner de cons", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-dinner-game-le-diner-de-cons", "creator_credit": "Francis Veber, Alain Poire and Sharmill Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), a wealthy publisher, yuppie and art collector is into competitions of a completely different nature.

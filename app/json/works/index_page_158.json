The film is a fascinating &#8216;slice-of-life&#8217; view of working class life in Britain of the 60s, whose entrancing black and white cinematography, reminiscent of Bill Brandt&#8217;s photography of working class England, contrasts with the gauche and drab reality of the characters&#8217; surrounds. This controversial film dealt with many taboo topics on the day - teen pregnancy, inter-racial romance, homosexuality, child abandonment, without excessive sermonising on the topics, typical of American moral dramas of the 1950s. Cast includes Dora Bryan, Rita Tushingham, Robert Stephens, Murray Melvin, Paul Danquah and David Boliver.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Unwanted", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-taste-of-honey", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1976424, "name": "Tony Richardson", "creator_id": 62037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976423, "name": "Woodfall Film Productions", "creator_id": 61992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976422, "name": "Continental", "creator_id": 26186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1976421, "name": "Bryanston Films", "creator_id": 23052, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52030", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [33664], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94157, "acmi_id": "317939", "title": "Movie crazy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "movie-crazy", "creator_credit": "Clyde Bruckman, Harold Lloyd and Harold Lloyd Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1932", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1932-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Lloyd&#8217;s alter ego is developed further in this film about a starstruck movie lover who, through a misunderstanding, lands the promise of a screen test.

Dandy is a &#8220;cyborg techno-human of fluid gender&#8221; who participates in a series of surreal, fetishistic sexual encounters whilst travelling across time and space in a bizzare futuristic universe. Extreme, visceral and visually inventive, the film gleefully upturns conventional notions of narrative, sex, gender and family, in its irreverent exploration of the relationship between body and machine, and the interplay between violence, eroticism and ritual. Cast includes Tre Temperilli, Hans Schierl and Svar Simpson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Erotica", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Great Britain", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Time travel in motion pictures", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 883116, "name": "Hans Scheirl", "creator_id": 35316, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51107", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [33039]}, {"id": 115376, "acmi_id": "S01171", "title": "Dandelion = Pusteblume", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dandelion-pusteblume", "creator_credit": "FIB", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A highly successful children&#8217;s series which was broadcast by the second German TV Channel.

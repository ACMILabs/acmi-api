The humans who surround the donkey are themselves in pain but they fail to understand - or do not wish to see - the connection between themselves and the animal which they use and which they abuse. Only a young peasant girl attempts to love the animal and it is within the beauty and innocence of this relationship that something approaching religious transcendence is made possible.

In an ouvre remarkable for its compassion, &#8220;Au Hasard Balthazar&#8221; stands out as one of cinema&#8217;s most important humanistic visions.

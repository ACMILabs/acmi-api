The first half is superficially theatrical in its refusal of conventional editing strategies but actually is notable for its subtle dramatic geometry involving permutations of position and composition afforded by the Scope screen. Multiple cameras were used to film long takes. The film suddenly opens out into an action-packed chase. Based on the novel &#8220;King&#8217;s Ransom&#8221; by Ed McBain.

The brashness of a youth who have experienced war passively through film and literature is incongruous with Tom&#8217;s traditional hard nosed ways, yet Tom has proven himself to be a complex character also, as the film follows his attempt to rekindle a past relationship with lines that he too has learnt from books. Tom&#8217;s skills for preparing men for battle are put to the test when the recruits experience war for the first time during an invasion of Granada. Cast also includes Marsha Mason, Everett McGill, Moses Gunn, Mario Van Peebles and Eileen Heckart.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Anti-war works", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Combat", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Navies", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Veterans", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sadism", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/heartbreak-ridge", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957365, "name": "Malpaso Company", "creator_id": 22109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957366, "name": "Clint Eastwood", "creator_id": 72253, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957364, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45385", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [27946], "external_references": [{"id": 1533, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q741196"}, {"id": 4368, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10015"}]}, {"id": 86938, "acmi_id": "308670", "title": "Heart condition", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "heart-condition", "creator_credit": "New Line Cinema, Steve Tisch and James D.

Danny&#8217;s life is further complicated by the presence of rental goons despatched by landlords in search of unpaid rent and the police chasing him in relation to a credit card debt thanks to a dodgy housemate. Proving he is not responsible is harder than lying about his identity. Based on the book of the same name by John Birmingham, `He Died With A Felafel In His Hand&#8217; is a wonderful satire on shared housing.

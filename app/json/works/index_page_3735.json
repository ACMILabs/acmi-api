This episode largely celebrates the great ABC pop show from the 1970s &#8220;Countdown&#8221;. Coming out of left field &#8220;Countdown&#8221; was a deliberate attempt by national broadcaster ABC to court teenagers, and they responded with gusto. The show became so enormously popular that it gained iconic status; whilst at the same time gave many acts their big break. Such acts, featured on this episode include: Sherbet, Skyhooks, John Paul Young, Marcia Hines, and Split Enz. &#8220;Countdown&#8221; also attracted high-calibre international guests like Elton John, Rod Steward and Madonna. Ian &#8220;Molly&#8221; Meldrum the show&#8217;s irreverent presenter and talent scout became an international personality. Australian variety television shows of the 1950s, and 1960s, celebrating yodelling, slap-stick and vaudevillian artists, paved the way for &#8220;Countdown&#8221;, which certainly shared with its predecessors an anarchic spirit, and passion for showcasing distinctly Australian culture. Made up of an array of interviews from past alumni, this episode features a heap of excerpts from the &#8220;Countdown&#8221;, including memorable clips, songs and interviews.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Love is in the air.

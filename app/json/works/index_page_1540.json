Schneebaum&#8217;s experiences garnered him notoriety upon his return - he lived with the tribes and even partook in a cannibalistic raid on another village. This documentary tracks Schneebaum&#8217;s visit to that same village 45 years later, displaying his ambivalence about returning there. Archival footage of Schneebaum appearing on numerous chat shows does much to display the cultural imperialism of American attitudes as well as Schneebaum&#8217;s own sensitive views towards those he studied. Schneebaum, an author and artist of some repute is also shown lecturing on the Asmat tribe of Papua New Guinea, who openly embrace bisexuality as a way of life.

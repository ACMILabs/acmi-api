The acronym stands for North-Eastern District Ski Association which was formed by ski clubs at Falls Creek and Hotham in 1937. Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era. The footage of the snow lodge and landscape is a good historical reflection of the architecture, furniture, and the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Title: Falls Creek 1964<br />\n00:00:18:00 Snowhaven Lodge signage on lodge wall<br />\n00:00:27:00 Exterior shot of Snowhaven Lodge<br />\n00:01:26:00 Children reading and knitting on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:03:23:00 Two people prepare to ski outside the lodge<br />\n00:03:57:00 The family have their meal on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:04:31:00 Title: NEDSA 1964<br />\n00:06:25:00 A young girl wearing ski goggles exclaims to the camera<br />\n00:06:52:00 Finishing line banner “Kastle Ski” and “Finish”<br />\n00:06:57:00 Skiers standing together with snow-covered slopes in the background<br />\n00:08:19:00 Timekeepers with stop watches and camera stand together with skiers at the end of a run.

The viral meme seems to have revealed that men, collectively, think about aqueducts from antiquity regularly. It started as a question on Instagram but has become a prank-style template, but it’s also at times considered alongside the &#8216;red/beige&#8217; flag relationship trend and the popularity of ancient Western civilisation on the misogynistic <a href=\"https://www.internetmatters.org/hub/news-blogs/what-is-the-manosphere-and-why-is-it-a-concern/\">manosphere</a>. </p>\n<p>According to Know Your Meme: </p>\n<p>Many are wondering if it&#8217;s a &#8220;red flag&#8221; if their male partner thinks about the Roman empire all the time. In some of the videos, the men sometimes answer &#8220;never,&#8221; and in the comment section, many women joke, &#8220;He&#8217;s a keeper.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That intersection between the Roman Empire trend and the &#8216;red flag&#8217; trend can be interpreted as identifying toxic masculinity. Online trolls and misogynists are at times inspired by examples of hyper-masculinity in antiquity as <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@themasculineedge/video/7278559608375921922\">justification for a return to outdated gender norms</a>. Ronald Levant, a professor emeritus of psychology at The University of Akron and author of <i>The Tough Standard: The Hard Truths About Masculinity and Violence</i> told <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/20/roman-empire-tiktok-trend-why-do-men-think-about-these-things/70903823007/\">USA Today</a> that men may &#8220;gravitate to a society that glorified male strength&#8221; as they feel lost in the world.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Women asking men this question conquered the internet in September. What makes this example funny is the man’s surprise at such a specific question. Like most videos in the trend, he goes from confused to defensive when he realises he actually thinks about Rome <i>a lot</i>, like many other men according to the virality of the trend. Though a light-hearted prank-style meme, it can also be interpreted as demonstrating the link between idolising ancient Western history and toxic masculinity.

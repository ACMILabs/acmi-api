Letos&#8217; bitter enemy Baron Vladimir Harkonnen invades Arrakis forcing the Duke&#8217;s lover and their son into the desert. Abandoned there, Paul discovers the true meaning of his destiny. Stylishly designed, this series certainly has an impressive aesthetic quality, ably capturing the otherworldliness of the book&#8217;s milieu, enhanced by extensive use of CGI. The mini-series format allows for a greater exploration of Herbert&#8217;s saga than the film version of &#8220;Dune&#8221; (Lynch, 1984). Like much science fiction, this futuristic tale has medieval and Biblical overtones with exotic sets, bizarre costumes and stilted dialogue that tends toward the florid and metaphoric. An interesting and engaging series. Cast includes William Hurt, Alec Newman, Saskia Reeves, James Watson, Jan Vlasak, Giancarlo Giannini.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Adaptations&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Closed captioning", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Life on other planets", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Mini-series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1806328, "name": "David Kappes", "creator_id": 34817, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923987, "name": "Sci Fi Channel", "creator_id": 34815, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923988, "name": "New Amsterdam Entertainment", "creator_id": 34816, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 923990, "name": "John Kent Harrison", "creator_id": 20990, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 923986, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50656", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32632], "external_references": []}, {"id": 86289, "acmi_id": "307950", "title": "Dune", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dune", "creator_credit": "Raffaella De Laurentiis, De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and David Lynch", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1984", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Based on Frank Herbert&#8217;s cult science fiction novel, &#8220;Dune&#8221; follows the fortune of Paul Atreides (Kyle Machlachan), whose family is persecuted by the Emperor (Jose Ferrer) and the evil Baron Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan).

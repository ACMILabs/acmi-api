The setting is rural, 1950s America. Selma (played by Icelandic pop star, Bjork), a Czech immigrant, works day and night to save money for an eye operation that will prevent her son from inheriting an eyesight condition that currently plagues her. What Selma lacks in vision, she makes up for in imagination. &#8216;Dancer in the dark&#8217; is punctuated with extended fantasy musical sequences in which the drabness of the everyday is transformed into something fantastic, joyous, rhythmic and utopian.

Loss of financial security and crude betrayal leads to murder, death and an overall Herculean sense of tragedy. Von Trier does many fascinating things in this film.

He does so by juxtaposing documentary-style, almost &#8216;home-video&#8217; footage, with extremely dazzling, technologically sophisticated, emotionally delirious musical numbers. By throwing together opposite cinematic styles, pushing the characters, the story and the audience to absolute limits of emotional intensity and melodrama, Von Trier not only brings out the essence of the musical as a boundless, overwhelming force, but also asks questions about cinema itself and its powers of storytelling in a post-modern, digital age.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Dancer in the dark</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Lars Von Trier, Vibeke Windelov, Trust Film Svenska, Arte France, France 3 Cinema and Zentropa Entertainment</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Denmark, 2000</p>", "description": "<p>&#8216;Dancer in the dark&#8217; is simultaneously an ode to the Hollywood musical, an experiment in digital filmmaking, and a wholly unique, landmark film in contemporary cinema.

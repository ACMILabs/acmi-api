After eleven months in office, Milk and the Mayor of San Francisco were assassinated by Dan White, a conservative member of the Board of Supervisors. The subsequent trial, in which White received a lenient sentence, resulted in massive rioting in San Francisco by gay and lesbian activists. Amidst the tragedy the film builds a convincing and impassioned picture of a man committed to human rights and human dignity.

Film was initially viewed as the poor cousin of theatre. To combat its reputation of being cheap entertainment for the lower classes, film sought to emulate the highbrow success of the theatre by replicating its lavish venues, poaching its stars for screen roles, and adapting plays into films. Working within the limitations of early film cameras and the staginess of Shakespeare&#8217;s works, many of the early productions were hybrids between stage and screen, juxtaposing constructed sets and stage-like tableaux with location shooting, trick photography, hand stencilling, and colour tinting. Works included are King John (Great Britain, 1899), the first ever film adaptation of Shakespeare; The Tempest (Great Britain, 1908); A Midsummer night&#8217;s dream (USA, 1909); King Lear (Italy, 1910); Twelfth night (USA, 1910); The Merchant of Venice (Italy, 1910), and Richard III (Great Britain, 1911).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Archival resources", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater - Production and direction"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20196, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/m4PDi8L77SDv8wvb2KeeSLNnGhR.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Silent Shakespeare (Unknown) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 960, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52021", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33655]}, {"id": 96383, "acmi_id": "503787", "title": "Silent safari: lion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "silent-safari-lion", "creator_credit": "Encyclopaedia Britannica Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Shows without commentary the lion as he eats, sleeps and plays with female and cubs in his natural habitat.

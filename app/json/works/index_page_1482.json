Zhi Ming, a monk in the Northern Shaolin, learns that the warlord who killed his parents is holding a birthday celebration. Without permission, Zhi Ming leaves the monastery and plans to assassinate the warlord. During the assassination attempt, Zhi Ming joins up with Sima Yan and Chao Wei, who come from the Southern Shaolin but have the same agenda. The assassination failed and the three escaped. Zhi Ming found that Sima Yan has a bracelet which is the same as the one on his foot. This means Sima Yan is Zhi Ming’s fiancée as their parents arranged the marriage before their birth. Aware that he is now a monk, Zhi Ming dares not reveal the secret to anybody. In the meantime, the warlord came with troops for a fight. With the help of the kung-fu masters from the Shaolin, Zhi Ming and Sima Yan eventually killed the warlord and took revenge for their parents. Zhi Ming went back to Shaolin with the monks and left his bracelet to Chao Wei, who is in deep love with Sima Yan.</p>\n<p>Southern and Northern Shaolin is one of the first Hong Kong and mainland China co-productions.

when directly translated into English, it means Life.  It is a re-adaptation from a novel of the same name published in1981, in which the Director and screenwriter try to expose the life of peasant farmers during a time of transition from the old, Communistic China, to a &#8216;new&#8217; China which breaks from the discreet eye of the Communist government.  The film reflects the hardships, demeaning experiences and environments of peasantry farmers, as well as general society views at the time. Naturally, as the moniker suggests, this film is about life, but simultaneously it is also very much about love.</p>\n<p>This film is a story which unravels from a woman&#8217;s unrequited love for a man.  After graduating from High school, the young male protagonist Gao Jialin had the hopes of working as a teacher in a primary school in the city.  However, his dream was shattered when the opportunity was directly given to the son of a cadre.  Gao was forced to return to the countryside to earn a living with his parents as lowly peasant farmers and this abrupt fall down the social ladder plagued him every day.  He was constantly in denial about his peasantry life until an illiterate, country girl Liu Qiaozhen attempts to open his eyes to see the beauty of the country folks and their country life.  Liu secretly admirs Gao, and often tries to go out of her way to help him.  She unreservedly and persistently reveals her love for Gao and eventually captures Gao&#8217;s heart; even changing his attitude towards country life.</p>\n<p>As time progress, the couple work together to raise awareness about health and hygiene in the country, looked after well water, gradually changing the country to become more civilized in small ways. However, although Gao finds that little positive changes have occurred, he still couldn&#8217;t abandon the thought of working in the city because his interest is still deeply rooted in writing literature. When Gao&#8217;s uncle changes his job and becomes the Regional Labour Secretary, without much thought, Gao grasps at the opportunity to break away from his lowly country life.  Subsequently, Gao&#8217;s old classmate and secret admirer Huang Yaping tries to help Gao secure a job as a journalist in the city.</p>\n<p>Liu was in depths of despair when Gao left for the city to work but they promised each other that they will remain faithful to one another.  However, Gao is tempted by the glitter and gold of living in the city and ultimately breaks up with Liu—choosing to develop his career over love.  Liu was left heartbroken and was soon married off to a man who had a crush on her from another village.</p>\n<p>Gao learns about Liu&#8217;s fate but was convinced by Huang, who despite already having a boyfriend, that he can have a brighter future in her company because she is educated and is brought up in a family of higher social class. As Gao starts to think that his dream is within reach; believing that he can lead a new and better life away from the country, Life tells him otherwise.

Foreign embassies are established in China for the first time.</p>\n<p>The Boxer Rebellion and the Eight-Power Allied Forces are recent memories, and China is in the process of re-establishing order and peace.</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin, a woman of suitable upbringing and comfortable living, is accused, by her husband, of writing a revolutionary poem: &#8220;The foreign forces pushed deep to the North, securing Chinese territory for themselves like a gift. The Chinese awoke to discover they were slaves&#8221;. He wonders why his wife is interested in state affairs.</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin tells her friend Zhiying that she has decided to go to Japan. Her friend warns her that it is difficult for a single woman to travel alone in a foreign country, and that Japan is currently at war with Russia on Chinese land. Her friend attempts to understand how a woman as delicate as Qiu Jin could be so passionate about politics.</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin prepares to leave, leaving her children with their grandparents. After an emotional goodbye, she arrives in Japan. She is greeted by Xiu Xilin, a revolutionary friend of hers from Shanghai. Qiu Jin settles into her new life in Japan, joining every revolutionary organisation, attending all the revolutionary rallies and even changing her name to Jing Xiong. Qiu Jin implores Xiu Xilin to join the alliance, and they discuss Sun Yat-Sen&#8217;s recent speech and the possibility of imminent revolution. Qiu Jin, we learn, believes in a unified China.</p>\n<p>They organise a hiking trip for the weekend, where Qiu Jin can meet the elusive Tianhua, a revolutionary writer who is having difficulty &#8216;enlightening the people&#8217;. The group picnics in the mountains, toasting to their cause. Qiu Jin resents that she is the only woman in the group, and that they other don&#8217;t understand the struggles of women.</p>\n<p>The Japanese make it increasingly difficult for Chinese people to live abroad, dismissing Chinese students. Tianhua tells the students, who are enraged by the new rules and quarrel amongst themselves, that if China itself cannot act as one, how can it be expected to stand up against the rest of the world? The students form a corps and agree to face the consulate with Qiu Jin as their leader.</p>\n<p>That night, Qiu Jin and Tianhua get to know each other. She confesses the difficulties she has faced leaving her entire life behind. Her passion for women&#8217;s rights, however, outweighs her pain.</p>\n<p>When Tianhua leaves, he gives Qiu Jin his sword and a note in which her confesses to his &#8216;phony idealism&#8217;. In his apartment, he is seen writing a note in which he admits that China is doomed to its fate, and that he would rather die today than in ten years time. &#8220;I hope my death will arouse the people so that they stand up and fight for their motherland&#8221;. He breaks down in tears. As Qiu Jin is shown admiring the sword, Tianhua commits suicide by walking into the ocean.</p>\n<p>In the wake of Tianhua&#8217;s death, the Japanese government ceases the movement to dismiss Chinese students. Qiu Jin, believing that she cannot further accomplish anything in Japan, returns to China. She is made head of the Alliance in Zhejiang Province, believing her to be equally tough and capable of the job as a man. Upon arrival, she learns that her mother has passed away.</p>\n<p>The revolutionaries discuss the impending working class uprising of 50 000 men. They are excited by the prospect of change.</p>\n<p>As leader of the Alliance, Qiu Jin formulates a plan to run the local school and to set up a physical education department, through which students can receive military training, ready to serve their country if the need arises. Her fellow revolutionaries fear that her plans are too extreme. The revolutionaries learn that the town of Anhui supports Qiu Jin&#8217;s plan to arm and train the students. They agree that the uprising should start Anhui, before spreading throughout all of China. Qiu Jin and Xiu Xilin, who have grown close, dream about how they will celebrate their victory, although they both worry about their families back home.</p>\n<p>The uprising takes place at the graduation ceremony of the Anhui Police Academy. Not all goes according to plan, however, and two revolutionaries are killed. The enemy discovers their plan. Of the four key revolutionaries, Qiu Jin is the only one who remains alive. In an act of surrender, she passes Tianhua&#8217;s sword and her literature down to Jinfa, who hesitantly accepts.</p>\n<p>When the Qing Dynasty officials invade the school, they find it empty. Qiu Jin is arrested. They attempt to pry further information from her, but she refuses to speak. They consider torturing her, but instead decide to give her the death sentence. Her husband Wang arrives, begging with the officials to soften her sentence, saving his family the embarrassment. The official agrees to reduce to a life sentence, but only if she confesses. Qiu Jin&#8217;s chambermaid visits her in prison. Qiu Jin makes her promise that if the revolution doesn&#8217;t succeed, that she will tell her children all about their mother&#8217;s heroic efforts and all the lives that where lost in the name of the revolution.</p>\n<p>The officials tell Qiu Jin she will receive a life sentence and her life will be spared if she confesses her actions. As a response, she writes them a revolutionary poem. Qiu Jin is executed. THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>Qiu Jin: A Revolutionary depicts the life of one of China&#8217;s most important female historical figures.

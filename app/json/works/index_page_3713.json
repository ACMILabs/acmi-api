Meanwhile, the eldest daughter, Skylar (Drew Barrymore) is deeply in love with Holden (Edward Norton). Music and an ensemble performance drive the intertwined love stories, which revolve around the members of an extended blended family. The story structure is almost a dance of life that continuously circles around in a cycle of love found, lost, and then found again. The disparate story elements are unified by the use of the narrator DJ (Natasha Lyonne), who is the college-age daughter of Steffi by a previous marriage to Joe. Like almost everyone else in the film, DJ is a romantic at heart who seems to be always falling in and out of love. In addition to narrating, she acts as cupid in helping Joe meet Von (Julia Roberts), a woman he has fallen in love with at first sight. All the principal actors are given at least one song, and with the exception of Drew Barrymore, do their own singing rather than have the voice of a professional singer dubbed in.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956521, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956520, "name": "Robert Greenhut", "creator_id": 46855, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956519, "name": "Jack Rollins", "creator_id": 77008, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956518, "name": "Charles H.

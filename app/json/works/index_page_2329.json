Morris doesn&#8217;t judge Leuchter but rather allows him to present his side of the story, no matter how bizarre. Part of what makes &#8220;Mr Death&#8221; so engaging is Morris&#8217; filmmaking style, which mixes first-person interview and documentary footage with an expressionist almost melodramatic style that creates an effective, eerie atmosphere perfectly suited to the odd material. &#8220;Mr Death&#8221; is fascinating and engrossing thanks to the totally eccentric nature of its main character and the various issues which his story raises and complicates, such as capital punishment, evilness, morality, and truth.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nazis", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Truth", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Europe", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Poland", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Prisoners and prisons", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison wardens", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisons", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Capital punishment", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fascism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National socialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nazis", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Truth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "History&nbsp;→ Jews - History", "History&nbsp;→ Nazis", "History&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemistry", "People&nbsp;→ Leuchter, Fred A."]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815639, "name": "Errol Morris", "creator_id": 4115, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q977546", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882897, "name": "Fourth Floor Pictures", "creator_id": 35129, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50975", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32919]}, {"id": 93408, "acmi_id": "316837", "title": "Fast, cheap & out of control = Fast cheap and out of control [NTSC]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fast-cheap-out-of-control-fast-cheap-and-out-of-control-ntsc", "creator_credit": "Errol Morris and Fourth Floor Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52823, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3067091"}], "brief_description": "<p>Fast, cheap &amp; out of control is another &#8216;non-fiction&#8217; film from acclaimed director Errol Morris.

The main villain is The General (Mitchell Ryan), a drug dealer responsible for the death of the daughter of one of Murtaugh&#8217;s oldest friends. The General is also in charge of a deadly, militia-like gang of smugglers. Adding fuel to the fire is The General&#8217;s chief henchman, played with all stops out by Gary Busey. With the addition of seven minutes extra footage to the original movie, this version of one of the classic &#8216;buddy&#8217; movies provides new action and additional insight into the characters.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 19}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 909791, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909792, "name": "Richard Donner", "creator_id": 25363, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909793, "name": "Joel Silver", "creator_id": 69235, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 909794, "name": "Richard Donner", "creator_id": 25363, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 909790, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909795, "name": "Mel Gibson", "creator_id": 76439, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909796, "name": "Danny Glover", "creator_id": 79354, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 909797, "name": "Gary Busey", "creator_id": 79355, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

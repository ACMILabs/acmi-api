Though she enjoys the support of friends, including her best friend Kathy (Catherine Deneuve) and neighbour Bill (David Morse), and is active in the local theatre group, things go from bad to worse for Selma. Loss of financial security and crude betrayal leads to murder, death and an overall Herculean sense of tragedy. Von Trier does many fascinating things in this film. Though he partakes in the Dogme tradition - which seeks to strip away the complete artifice of cinema and usher in the &#8216;real&#8217; through only &#8216;natural&#8217; means - Von Trier also reworks and questions it. He does so by juxtaposing documentary-style, almost &#8216;home-video&#8217; footage, with extremely dazzling, technologically sophisticated, emotionally delirious musical numbers. By throwing together opposite cinematic styles, pushing the characters, the story and the audience to absolute limits of emotional intensity and melodrama, Von Trier not only brings out the essence of the musical as a boundless, overwhelming force, but also asks questions about cinema itself and its powers of storytelling in a post-modern, digital age.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Denmark", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Blindness", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960759, "name": "Lars Von Trier", "creator_id": 28810, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960758, "name": "Vibeke Windelov", "creator_id": 28808, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960757, "name": "Trust Film Svenska", "creator_id": 34128, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960756, "name": "Arte France", "creator_id": 32232, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960755, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960754, "name": "Zentropa Entertainment", "creator_id": 34127, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960753, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19625, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/9rsivF4sWfmBzrNr4LPu6TNJhXX.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Dancer in the dark (Lars Von Trier) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 800, "height": 1200, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

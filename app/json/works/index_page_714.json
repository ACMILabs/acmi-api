His world changes when he meets the fabulous Angie, a young woman who treats him with respect and loving attention. They begin a friendship which is initially fun until Seymour comes to understand that his friend is a heroin user, and her life not as carefree and safe as he initially believed. Lowenstein&#8217;s gift for understanding the specificicities of subculture make this a moving film about families and contemporary dislocation. Sudi de Winter is excellent as Angie and Mickey Camilleri is the shy child Seymour. Co-stars Ben Mendelsohn. Based on Robin Klein&#8217;s novel &#8220;Came back to show you I could fly&#8221; with music by Not Drowning, Waving.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Richmond (Vic.)", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Places&nbsp;→ Richmond (Vic.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2263276, "name": "Jill Bilcock", "creator_id": 7038, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263275, "name": "Richard Lowenstein", "creator_id": 4700, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263274, "name": "Carol Hughes", "creator_id": 901, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2263273, "name": "Flying Films", "creator_id": 27303, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2263269, "name": "21st Century Pictures", "creator_id": 77799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41341", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [24838], "external_references": []}, {"id": 76922, "acmi_id": "323521", "title": "Saw sense", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "saw-sense", "creator_credit": "Jack Zalkalns, John Honey and Tasmanian Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A chainsaw safety film aimed at both the professional and domestic user.

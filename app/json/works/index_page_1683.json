Clive lives alone in a country mansion and spends his nights cursing his fate as he inserts suppositories, sits on the &#8216;throne&#8217; and downs bottle after bottle of white wine. In his nightmare, the characters of his novel mix with his real life relatives. As Clive gathers his relatives around him for a final week-end and they attempt to nurse him back to life, he realises that they are not the monsters he perceived them to be.</p>\n<p>Credits: Produces, Yves Gasser, Yves Renot, Klaus Hellwig ; director, Alain Resnais ; writers, David Mercer ; photography, Ricardo Aronovitch ; music, Miklos Rozsa ; art direction, Jacques Saulnier.<br />\nCast: Dirk Bogarde, Ellen Burstyn, John Gielgud, David Warner, Elain Stritch, Peter Arne.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815897, "name": "Klaus Hellwig", "creator_id": 77444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1815896, "name": "Yves Peyrot", "creator_id": 79373, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1815895, "name": "Yves Gasser", "creator_id": 79374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890321, "name": "Alain Resnais", "creator_id": 71944, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q218022", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146585", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [55362], "external_references": [{"id": 116, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2038175"}]}]}

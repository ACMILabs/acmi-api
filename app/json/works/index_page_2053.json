Cast includes Jean-Pierre Bacri, Anne Alvaro, Agnes Jaoui, Gerard Lanvin, Alain Chabat, Brigitte Catillon, Christiane Millet and Vladimir Yordanoff.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual attraction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2475054, "name": "Agnes Jaoui", "creator_id": 36527, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q240521", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475053, "name": "Charles Gassot", "creator_id": 77206, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2959173", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475052, "name": "Christian Berard", "creator_id": 80835, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1079125", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475051, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475049, "name": "France2 Cinema", "creator_id": 36524, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q10498467", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475048, "name": "Les Films A4", "creator_id": 36523, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2475050, "name": "Telema Productions", "creator_id": 36525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2475047, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52436", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34011]}, {"id": 91870, "acmi_id": "315044", "title": "The Watermelon Woman", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-watermelon-woman", "creator_credit": "Cheryl Dunye, Alexandra Juhasz, Barry Swimar and Dancing Girl Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52799, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2065014"}], "brief_description": "<p>One of the first feature films made by an African American lesbian, this &#8216;mockumentary&#8217; ostensibly investigates the life of a forgotten black actress from the thirties known only as, the Watermelon Woman.

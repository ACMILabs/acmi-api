At the commencement of Season two (Ep. 1 &#8216;Little green men&#8217;) Scully and Mulder have been deliberately kept apart by unknown government forces and are back doing rank and file FBI investigations. Believing that the agency keeps them under constant surveillance, Scully and Mulder must now meet in secret. Agent Mulder has lost hope in ever finding &#8216;the truth&#8217; behind his sisters alien abduction, while agent Scully has become despondent with her extra-ordinary FBI teaching duties. Of course that doesn&#8217;t last and the two find themselves together again investigating a recent UFO sighting in Puerto Rico which the government is desperately trying to cover up. The second season delves even deeper into the mythologies set up in season one, accumulating with agent Scully&#8217;s abduction (Ep. 5 &#8216;Duane Barry&#8217;) and agent Mulder discovering some shocking revelations about his sister&#8217;s disappearance (Ep. 16 &#8216;Colony&#8217;). In season two creator Chris Carter creates a nice role reversal between the agents, as the scientifically minded Scully begins to entertain the existence of extraterrestrial life, while Mulder begins to lose interest in finding out the &#8216;truth&#8217;. Season two also sees the introduction of Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a duplicitous FBI agent who is initially assigned as Mulder&#8217;s partner when Scully goes missing (Ep. 4 &#8216;Sleepless&#8217;). Cast also includes William B. Davis and Mitch Pileggi.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>X-files = X files. Season 2.

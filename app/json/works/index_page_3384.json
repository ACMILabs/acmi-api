This exuberant, delightful film is well up to the honour of being his last musical. Based on the 1947 Broadway hit, Fred Astaire plays an Irish rogue with a whimsical economic theory: bury a stolen crock of leprechaun gold in the soil near Fort Knox and stand back! Mixed up in the shenanigans are his spirited daughter (Petula Clark) and love-struck leprechaun (Tommy Steele). Director Francis Ford Coppola skilfully updates the Broadway hit and lovingly show cases its most enduring treasure - the Burton Lane/E.Y. Harburg score. This charming film garnered an Oscar nomination for Musical Direction and includes well-known numbers such as &#8216;If this isn&#8217;t love&#8217;, &#8216;How are things in Glocca Morra?&#8217;, &#8216;Look to the rainbow&#8217; and &#8216;Old devil moon&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951541, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951542, "name": "Seven Artists", "creator_id": 25508, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951543, "name": "Joseph Landon", "creator_id": 25509, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951544, "name": "Francis Ford Coppola", "creator_id": 503, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951540, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 951545, "name": "Fred Astaire", "creator_id": 76474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39291", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [22859], "external_references": [{"id": 1622, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1198750"}]}, {"id": 67520, "acmi_id": "003697", "title": "Fingers and clay", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fingers-and-clay", "creator_credit": "Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1967", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1967-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Part of the Outlook series.

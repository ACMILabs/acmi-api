The directors invited to participate were: Yussef Chahine, Amos Gitai, Shohei Imamura, Claude Lelouch, Ken Loach, Mira Nair, Idrissa Ouedraogo, Sean Penn, Samira Makhmalbaf, Danis Tanovic, and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. The results are very mixed &#8212; from the abstract to the obvious &#8212; and the overall piece did not meet with great acclaim. Regardless, the project has some insightful moments, in particular, the segments from Ken Loach, Mira Nair and Samira Makhmalbaf.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Iran", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Coups d'etat", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - Religious aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ September 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Experimental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "History&nbsp;→ Coups d'etat", "History&nbsp;→ September 11 Terrorist Attacks, 2001", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History - 21st century", "Places&nbsp;→ Iran", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Iran", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Mexico", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929549, "name": "Galatee Films", "creator_id": 29785, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929550, "name": "Studio Canal", "creator_id": 31030, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929551, "name": "Youssef Chahine", "creator_id": 72767, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929552, "name": "Amos Gitai", "creator_id": 72768, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929553, "name": "Shohei Imamura", "creator_id": 30861, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929554, "name": "Claude Lelouch", "creator_id": 72762, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929555, "name": "Ken Loach", "creator_id": 72757, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929556, "name": "Mira Nair", "creator_id": 72766, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929557, "name": "Idrissa Ouédraogo", "creator_id": 72771, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929558, "name": "Sean Penn", "creator_id": 72765, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929559, "name": "Samira Makhmalbaf", "creator_id": 72770, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929560, "name": "Danis Tanovic", "creator_id": 36217, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929561, "name": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu", "creator_id": 34305, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 929548, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52960", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34415]}]}

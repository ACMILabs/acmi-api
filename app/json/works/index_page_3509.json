Through interviews with the people themselves, their family and friends, archival film footage, newsreels and stills, we learn about their lives, their ambitions, achievements and failures, and their absolute commitment to Aboriginal rights. &#8220;For who I am: Bonita Mabo&#8221; - Wife of Eddie Mabo and born in Vanautu, Bonita Mabo has, since the death of her husband, become a political activist for the recognition of her people as South Sea Islanders and not Torres Strait Islanders. Bonita also remembers her times with Eddie during the many years of struggle over Aboriginal land rights. &#8220;Stranger in my skin: Ray Cotti&#8221; - A story about identity, about Ray Cotti who grew up feeling he was a white man in a black man&#8217;s skin. Adopted by white parents when he was a baby and brought up with white values, Ray, confused and at crisis point emotionally, decides to track down his biological parents and to seek out his Aboriginality. &#8220;Jetja Nai medical mob: Naomi Mayers&#8221; - A woman of absolute strength and presence who is totally committed to Aboriginal health and the establishment of free community medical services throughout Australia for Aboriginal people. &#8220;Mistake Creek: Steven Craig&#8221; - Along with his wife Jo-Anne and his children, Steven Craig takes on the mammoth task of managing a cattle station in outback north-west Northern Territory - a decision which probably saved his marriage and his family. &#8220;Media nomads: Mick Thaiday, Bill Thaiday&#8221; - Brothers, Bill and Mick grew up on Palm Island listening to Smokey Dawson on the radio. As adults, broadcasting was in their blood and through BRACS (Broadcast Remote Aboriginal Community Scheme), Bill was trained in all aspects of radio broadcasting and is now committed, along with his brother Mick, to setting up Aboriginal radio stations throughout remote Australia. &#8220;Saltwater bluesman: Uncle Kiddo Taylor&#8221; - A tribute to Uncle Kiddo and his musical talents on the harmonica by his niece, Michelle Torres. Uncle Kiddo&#8217;s musical background stems back to the pearling days of the luggers in Broome and the cultural mix of Asians and Aboriginals.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Adoption", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Attitudes", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Biography", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Civil rights", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Cultural assimilation", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Employment", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Government relations", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Health and hygiene", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Legal status, laws, etc.", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Medical care", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Mixed descent", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Removal", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Treatment", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Government relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture conflict", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnology - Australia", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Music", "People&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Indigenous peoples", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 883751, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883752, "name": "CAAMA", "creator_id": 7178, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883753, "name": "Macumba Media Enterprises", "creator_id": 80589, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883754, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883755, "name": "Rod Freedman", "creator_id": 80590, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 883750, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51879", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33521], "external_references": []}, {"id": 75990, "acmi_id": "013698", "title": "Everybody rides the carousel.

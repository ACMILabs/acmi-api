Through candid interviews with seven elderly women the impact of World War II on the women who were left behind and the men in their lives is constructed in a series of deeply personal and unexpected stories. Combined with newsreel footage and still photographs, the choice and sequence of the womens&#8217; stories woven together by Gaylene Preston provides a powerful and wide-ranging portrait of New Zealand society and the long repressed emotions provoked by the experience of war.

A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era. The footage of the snow lodge and landscape is a good historical reflection of the architecture, furniture, and the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Title: Falls Creek 1964<br />\n00:00:18:00 Snowhaven Lodge signage on lodge wall<br />\n00:00:27:00 Exterior shot of Snowhaven Lodge<br />\n00:01:26:00 Children reading and knitting on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:03:23:00 Two people prepare to ski outside the lodge<br />\n00:03:57:00 The family have their meal on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:04:31:00 Title: NEDSA 1964<br />\n00:06:25:00 A young girl wearing ski goggles exclaims to the camera<br />\n00:06:52:00 Finishing line banner “Kastle Ski” and “Finish”<br />\n00:06:57:00 Skiers standing together with snow-covered slopes in the background<br />\n00:08:19:00 Timekeepers with stop watches and camera stand together with skiers at the end of a run.

We then see the baby lying in her pram and being closely inspected and entertained by her older sibling.</p>\n<p>We then go back to the beach with three very young children playing on the water’s edge with their mother beside them. Adults sit on the sand socialising, and there are scenes on the veranda of a holiday house. We see great examples of beach fashion, women&#8217;s hats, and children’s swimsuits.</p>\n<p>This film shows examples of Victoria in the summertime, beach, women’s fashion and children’s fashion, children’s swim wear, vintage toys and a perambulator, children’s leisure and recreation activities that reflect the time.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:18:00 Mother and three boys playing in the sand<br />\n00:02:25:00 Children filling buckets with sand<br />\n00:02:36:00 Two children filling buckets with sand<br />\n00:03:09:00 Young boy crawling along the sea wall<br />\n00:03:34:00 Eating ice creams from cones, offering to share with passers by<br />\n00:03:50:00 Close up of eating ice cream<br />\n00:06:25:00 Three children on their tricycles with backyard swing<br />\n00:06:56:00 Two boys swing on their backyard bench swing<br />\n00:07:03 :00 Three children on swing<br />\n00:07:24:00 Children playing in sandpit<br />\n00:08:36:00 Nice wide shot of children playing on swing and in the sandpit<br />\n00:09:52:00 Three children playing in blow up wading pool<br />\n00:10:17:00 Three children crowded on a backyard swing together<br />\n00:10:32:00 Children trying to move wading pool full of water across the grass<br />\n00:12:44:00 Boys play with toy police car in sand pit<br />\n00:14:08:00 Children play with what appears to be an American shaped football<br />\n00:15:32:00 Boy riding on vintage tricycle in front of house<br />\n00:17:13:00 Baby in vintage pram with sibling peering in and attempting to play<br />\n00:17:53:00 Mother and three very young children sit at the water’s edge<br />\n00:18:15:00 Very young child at water’s edge – good example of children&#8217;s swim wear<br />\n00:20:28:00 Family on veranda of holiday house with seascape in background<br />\n00:21:48:00 Three women sitting on the beach wearing great hats<br />\n00:22:51:00 Great family beach scene as above</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:23:32:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Playgrounds", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1337609, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 2331, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/_fGlmOsdGuQ"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178595", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1950s-1960s", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1950s-1960s"}], "labels": [59198]}, {"id": 119199, "acmi_id": "Z000128", "title": "Florence", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "florence", "creator_credit": "Kamina Vincent, Ken Wong and Mountains", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2018", "record_type": "work", "type": "Videogame", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "digital videogame", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2018-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Expertly blending the visual novel and gaming genres, Florence illustrates one year in the life of a young woman in Melbourne as she falls in love, breaks her daily routine and follows her creative passion.</p>\n<p>Developed by Australian craft games studio Mountains, Florence uses innovative gameplay mechanics to represent social interactions.

These variable formats are currently being digitised to ensure the preservation and legacy of the artist’s archive.</p>\n<p>The Stelarc Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the artist through the Cultural Gifts Program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1337583, "name": "Stelarc", "creator_id": 8996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 118261, "acmi_id": "B2003948", "title": "[Stelarc: The Third Hand Tokyo 1981]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-the-third-hand-tokyo-1981", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "173786", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970s-2000s Decade", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970s-2000s Decade"}], "labels": [58688]}, {"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This video is documentation of a performance entitled &#8220;Modulate / Meditate: Event for Modified Man&#8221; held at Tamura Gallery in Tokyo, Japan, from 26 January to 1 February 1976.</p>\n<p>In this durational performance, Stelarc has hooks inserted into his back and sews first his lips and then his eyelids closed with a needle and thread.

Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>After his signature opening title, &#8216;Round About Alice&#8217;, Wallace goes to the desert landscape around Alice Springs, in the Northern Territory, including close-ups of wildflowers and distance shots of &#8216;Mount Conner&#8217;. We see Alice Springs streets and landmarks, and the annual (since 1970) &#8216;Alice Springs Lions Club Camel Cup&#8217; race. Features the historic Alice Springs Telegraph Station (1872), once also the site of &#8216;The Bungalow&#8217; school, (1932-1942) for children then identified by government as &#8216;part aboriginal&#8217;.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’.

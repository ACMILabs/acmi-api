While the studios rush to re-equip and sound-proof their facilities, filmmakers embark on a local polemic regarding the artistic set back represented by sound. Their arguements are simple: prisonner of the linguistic barriers, &#8216;talkies&#8217; will loose their universality ; the camera, which the &#8216;Avant-Garde&#8217; had tamed and made mobile, is now static and enslaved to the demands of sound recording. Furthermore, the only sound recording systems are foreign: Tobis-Klang Film in Berlin or Western Electric and RCA in the USA. French filmmakers make, at first, a rather gimmicky use of the sound process, (the first sound heard in a French film is that of bath being emptied) until a little mouse convince them that sound can be used intelligently to serve the dramaturgy. Yes! Mickey Mouse imposes the &#8216;talkies&#8217; in France. Ironically, it was Rene Clair, one of the most vociferous opponents of sound, who directed the first great French sound film, &#8216;Sous les toits de Paris&#8217;<em>, at the Epinay studios in 1930. Although the film did manifest an adventurous use of sound - privileging songs while reducing dialogue to a minimum, and including some counterpoint experiments, in which sound and image were not synchronised - it was most notable for Lazare Meerson&#8217;s set design, which evoked a realistic yet lyrical picture of working-class Paris.&#8221; Reference: Guy Austin. &#8216;Contemporary French cinema&#8217;.

The premiere of the &#8216;Jazz Singer&#8217; in New York catches the French studios unprepared and the filmmakers unwilling to accept with this technical revolution. While the studios rush to re-equip and sound-proof their facilities, filmmakers embark on a local polemic regarding the artistic set back represented by sound. Their arguements are simple: prisonner of the linguistic barriers, &#8216;talkies&#8217; will loose their universality ; the camera, which the &#8216;Avant-Garde&#8217; had tamed and made mobile, is now static and enslaved to the demands of sound recording. Furthermore, the only sound recording systems are foreign: Tobis-Klang Film in Berlin or Western Electric and RCA in the USA. French filmmakers make, at first, a rather gimmicky use of the sound process, (the first sound heard in a French film is that of bath being emptied) until a little mouse convince them that sound can be used intelligently to serve the dramaturgy.

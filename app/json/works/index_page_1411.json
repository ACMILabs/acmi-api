Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, Ted captures a trip to Queensland and New South Wales. The film features scenes of holidaying in Queensland, touring around Surfers Paradise, Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Coffs Harbour, before travelling down the East Coast from Sydney to Eden and Lakes Entrance. The film includes memorable scenes such as a show of aqua ballet and water ski stunts in Surfers Paradise, dolphins in the Pet Porpoise Pool in Coffs Harbour, historic buildings in Brisbane and fruit farms on the Sunshine Coast.</p>\n<p>Of particular interest is Lennon’s Hotel in Broadbeach, which was one of the earliest hotels in Surfers Paradise.

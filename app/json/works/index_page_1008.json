Aping the very successful style of &#8220;The Ring&#8221; (Hideo Nakata, 1998), Takashi Shimizu engages in elliptical narrative threads, whilst providing requisite scares and thrills. This film is a big-screen re-working of &#8220;Ju-on&#8221; and &#8220;Ju-on 2&#8221; two low budget Shimizu films. Cast includes: Megumi Okina, Misaki Ito, Kanji Tsuda, Shuri Matsuda, and Misa Uehara.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Foreign language films", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1820219, "name": "Takashige Ichise", "creator_id": 32769, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929527, "name": "Aozora Investment", "creator_id": 36986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929528, "name": "Nikkatsu Kabushiki Kaisha", "creator_id": 34680, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929530, "name": "Takashi Shimizu", "creator_id": 36987, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q463565", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 929526, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

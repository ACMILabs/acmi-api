Set almost entirely in fashionable interiors, stylishly photographed, and with music by Peer Raben the film begs comparison with Fassbinder&#8217;s work. Yet Van Ackeren&#8217;s film lacks Fassbinder&#8217;s assured hand. Cool and distanced, his study of a middle and upper class world ruled by money, power, and sex - where the unexpected and bizarre lie just beneath the tranquil surface, hovers uncertainly between voyeurism and social criticism.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Robert van Ackeren ; writers, Robert van Ackeren, Catherina Zwerenz ; photography, Jurgen Jurges ; editing, Tanja Schmidbauer ; music, Peer Raben.<br />\nCast: Gudrun Landgrebe, Mathieu Carriere, Hanns Zischler, Gabriele Lafari, Matthias Fuchs.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "German"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Middle classes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sexual ethics", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2190360, "name": "Robert van Ackeren", "creator_id": 82169, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q88104", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146285", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [55142], "external_references": []}]}

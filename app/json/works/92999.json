During the British colonial rule, British men were encouraged to marry Indian women in order that their children would help further Britain&#8217;s imperial interest in India. Children of these marriages became known as Anglo-Indians (or in earlier years, Eurasians) and lived a fairly wealthy lifestyle during the British colonial years of the late 19th century. However as time went on, racism and discrimination began to seep in and Anglo-Indians then found themselves in limbo - neither Indian nor British. After India won independence in 1947, two-thirds of the Anglo-Indian community emigrated to other parts of the British Commonwealth such as Britain, Canada and Australia. Those left behind became dislocated from their families and their living conditions declined quite dramatically.

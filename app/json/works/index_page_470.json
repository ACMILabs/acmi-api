100,00 spectators (over 4 billion viewers worldwide) and over 12,000 performers celebrated the opening of the 27th Olympiad in Sydney, Australia. Ric Birch, Director of Ceremonies, and David Atkins, the artistic director, produced an epic pageant of Australian culture, from stockmen on horseback to an Aboriginal Corroboree and clan members representing the original Australians, an homage to our sea-loving nature to the modern dance numbers which represented current Australian lifestyles and attitudes.

Written by Kate Gillick and Harold Furber.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>An autobiographical documentary which tells the story of a member of the &#8216;stolen generation&#8217; of Aboriginal children of mixed descent. In 1957 at age four, Harold Furber was taken from the desert regions near Alice Springs by the Commonwealth Government, and placed in a Methodist missionary camp on Croker Island, 225 km north-east of Darwin. Telling his story through the use of slides and archival footage taken at the mission during the fifties and sixties, Furber recounts a childhood where his fragile but growing feeling of belonging to a new family and home on Croker Island, was continually shattered by the confusion and sense of loss and pain caused by his separation from his family and his country. Carrying a deep sense of alienation and bitterness into his adult life, Furber attempts through this documentary, to reconstruct his fractured identity by reconnecting with his birthplace and community. Narrated by Harold Furber.

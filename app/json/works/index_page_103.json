Filmed in delicate black and white, &#8220;The Hours and Times&#8221; is, apart from a fine film about the possibilities and dangers of male friendship, also an intriguing glimpse into the recent past: the point when pop culture was about to explode and consume the world, that moment when it seemed possible that music could change the world. The film features remarkable performances by Ian Hart as Lennon and David Angus as Epstein.

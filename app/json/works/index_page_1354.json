Quite the opposite, in fact. Indeed, the extreme pressure and excitement of this time inspires a deep sense of cameraderie between them, as they recognise that they are not alone in their struggle. Of course, competition always manages to bring out the worst antisocial traits in a select few, but the group overall are seen to flourish, often going to great pains to stick their neck out for each other.</p>\n<p>The film explains the powerful bond made between friends and classmates of these years, and how struggle is not only a necessary part of life, but teaches us how to empathise with others and work together. The contemporary view of this film is more likely to equate to something like: Harry Potter, with no magic, in Communist China.</p>\n<p>Among the film&#8217;s many themes it examines antisocial personality traits, with plenty of cheating in basketball games, skirting labor, cherrypicking others&#8217; praise, taking advantage of the latitudes of the system, etc. However, we are expected to understand that, in all these situations, it is the Truth which shines through in the long run to reveal people&#8217;s true intentions and motives.</p>\n<p>Although the children are shown to celebrate their 14th year, it would be more realistic to see this as an expression of general nostalgia for those who have left those more simple times behind. The film, therefore, advocates that this is the time young people should appreciate fully the joy of being alive before moving on to a glorious future (something that any young person can expect to be told by their elders).<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald; June 10, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social interaction in youth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social work with youth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Boarding schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Schools - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal relations in adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Social interaction in youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Stress in adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Adolescent psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Stress in adolescence", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889765, "name": "Beijing Children's Film Company", "creator_id": 82370, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889766, "name": "Zhao Yuan", "creator_id": 82402, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889767, "name": "Luo Chensheng", "creator_id": 82403, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889768, "name": "Zhao Yuan", "creator_id": 82402, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889769, "name": "Sun Yongtian", "creator_id": 82404, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889770, "name": "Wang Jiuzhi", "creator_id": 82405, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889771, "name": "Lin A'mian", "creator_id": 82406, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889772, "name": "Xu Hu", "creator_id": 82407, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889773, "name": "Zeng Wei", "creator_id": 82408, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889774, "name": "Liu Tiechuan", "creator_id": 82409, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889775, "name": "Yuan Yuan", "creator_id": 82410, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889776, "name": "Bai Xilian", "creator_id": 82411, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146411", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [55259]}]}

Miscommunication and secret trysts (real and imagined) leads characters to draw false conclusions. Several red herrings increase the intensity of the murder mystery, but the real concern of the film is the kaleidoscope of human failings and interactions, reflecting a complex interweaving of intent and desire. Paul Kelly&#8217;s score serves as an effective moody soundtrack to the film. Winner of seven AFI awards. Cinematography by Mandy Walker. Cast includes Anthony La Paglia, Geoffrey Rush, Barbara Hershey, Kerry Armstrong, Rachael Blake, Vince Colosimo, Peter Phelps, Leah Purcell, Glenn Robins.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1812531, "name": "Jan Chapman", "creator_id": 3383, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3161628", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1771542, "name": "Mandy Walker", "creator_id": 86406, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1771541, "name": "Ray Lawrence", "creator_id": 9735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1771539, "name": "Saddleback Productions", "creator_id": 26195, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1771538, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1771537, "name": "MBP", "creator_id": 35432, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1771536, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51217", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33103], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93567, "acmi_id": "317072", "title": "Walk the talk", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "walk-the-talk", "creator_credit": "Jan Chapman, Mandy Walker, Shirley Barrett and NBCUniversal", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Shirley Barrett displayed a penchant for black comedy with her successful debut feature &#8220;Love serenade&#8221;. &#8220;Walk the talk&#8221;, her second feature, is a darkly comic tale about several deluded individuals trying to govern unreachable dreams of stardom.

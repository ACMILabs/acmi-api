The skinhead, unsure of how he feels about the hairdresser&#8217;s attentions seeks advice from his sister but she is a lesbian separatist filmmaker and not much interested in what goes on between men. Gleefully upsetting the expectations of both the heterosexual and homosexual mainstreams, &#8220;No Skin off my Ass&#8221; is a film that mixes up gender, sex roles and ideology. LaBruce is uninterested in &#8220;positive&#8221; images of gay men.

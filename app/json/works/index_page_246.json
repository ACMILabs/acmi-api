The film is set in Cuba just before the revolution, with Castro&#8217;s revolutionary brigades still fighting in the mountains and with the US backed dictator, Batista, still in power. A minimalist but effective voice-over written by Yevgenis Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, introduces us to the story of Cuba, a tale not only of a beautiful island, but a story of sugar cane, and the history of slavery, oppression and imperialist exploitation that the sugar industry brought with it. Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba. A young woman who lives in a shanty town has to prostitute herself to Western tourists to survive. A peasant sees his land stolen away from him. A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas.

The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA).

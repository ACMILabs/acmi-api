In a telling voice-over narration Ed ponders, ruminates, contemplates adding insight into his plight - &#8220;me I don&#8217;t talk much, I just cut the hair&#8221; encapsulating his alienation. Frances McDormand also excels as Ed&#8217;s blowsy, hard-drinking and hard-hearted wife - a very Coen-esque femme fatale.

A gang of incompetent American troops, led by Walker, head south from San Francisco to liberate Nicaragua from its oppressive president. Corneilius Vanderbuilt, a tycoon millionaire, funds the mission, but feels Walker&#8217;s naive, albeit charismatic, character will ensure stability in the Central American state controlling the Pacific-Atlantic trade. Walker embodies the religious and puritanical traits of manifest destiny and is filled with notions of self-importance and historical greatness. Walker is oblivious to the barbarity of his own troops and their thirst for sex and violence; ironically the behaviour of his men epitomizes the false image that Walker holds of the savages. When Nicaragua is won Walker places a patriot as President; he appoints himself General of the armed forces and, in an act that summarizes the history of the South America, stages a coup against his own government.

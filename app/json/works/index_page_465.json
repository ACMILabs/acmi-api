As Ewa herself says &#8220;The object of life is to live. To have it all and at any price&#8221;. Ewa is a single parent, living in Warsaw with her young daughter (the result of an affair whilst in Rome). With the help and support of her mother in caring for her daughter, Ewa is able to pursue her career, take up judo lessons and maintain the odd affair or two. Ewa believes in the issue, but has no time for the people, innocent or guilty, whom she may expose in getting her story on to the front page. That is until she meets and befriends Marianna, a young girl who lives and works in a local brothel. Through Marianna, Ewa is finally forced to confront her own demons. Cast includes Wladyslaw Kowalski, Malgorzata Zajaczkowska, Zdzislaw Wardejn, Emilian Kaminski, Jadwiga Polanowska, Malgorzata Pritulak.

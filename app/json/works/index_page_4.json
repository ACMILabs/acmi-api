As Halloween Harry, a fearless ghost-hunter, you have been assigned to destroy an evil witch who has taken over a 13-room building. You do this by collecting the magic item in each room, then escape through a mystical door. There are 12 items to collect, ranging from a broom in room 1 to a cauldron in room 12. When all the items are collected, you must confront the witch in the 13th room. The witch is protected by a magical barrier, so you must collect a padlock and a key (in any order) so that her defence is broken down… Once exposed, you may zap the witch with your trusty garlic-blaster laser gun, (which has 13 shots). 3 additional shots may be obtained by grabbing the bonus garlic. To make your task difficult, the witch has summoned up various ghosts and ghouls, as well as the dreaded dropjaws and zombie hands to destroy you! Don’t forget there’s a time limit.

Tracey looks different, she sometines has a shaved head and many tattoos and she is scarred from &#8216;slashing up&#8217;. Tracey acts differently, she doesn&#8217;t follow the social rules of behaviour. She loves trams and has the word &#8216;tram&#8217; tattooed on her hand. She has a mental illness which has led her to being institutuionalised a number of times. She is both street wise and disarmingly trusting and generous. She looks very tough, yet she is very sensitive and vulnerable. She tells her story &#8216;in your face&#8217; and she tells it &#8216;straight&#8217; about abuse, institutions, drug addiction, mental illness, slashing up, giving up her baby for adoption and also about friendships, fun, love and hope. Tracey&#8217;s story tells us alot about living with mental illness, about being different and about surviving without losing your spirit or humanity.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Biographical", "Documentary", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1227345, "name": "Sakshi Productions", "creator_id": 81886, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1227344, "name": "Stewart Lodge", "creator_id": 9069, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1227343, "name": "Tracey Power", "creator_id": 9068, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1227342, "name": "Katrina Sawyer", "creator_id": 9067, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1227341, "name": "Katrina Sawyer", "creator_id": 9067, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1227340, "name": "Victorian College of the Arts, School of Film and Television", "creator_id": 9066, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL];

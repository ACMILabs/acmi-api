As you play, your movements are tracked through a cloud of spores that ultimately engulfs you.</p>\n<p>Rotted Luck disrupts the usual interactivity and visual style of slot machines to encourage a stranger, shared and more joyful experience. By subverting conventional game mechanics, it proposes an outcome that isn’t about ‘winning’. Communal, non-addictive and movement-based, Rotted Luck favours the fun of play.</p>\n<p>To create the piece, artists Vidya Rajan and Ian MacLarty studied slot machine design and imagined a fungus mistaking one for food. They photographed real decaying fruit, transformed them into 3D models, and used a common webcam to track player movements.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Commissioned by ACMI</p>", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["Variable duration dependent on interactivity, looped"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Real-time interactive installation"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2569315, "name": "Ian MacLarty", "creator_id": 86509, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2569316, "name": "Vidya Rajan", "creator_id": 87633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "195854", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2024", "notes": "", "to_year": "2024"}], "labels": [62145]}, {"id": 120412, "acmi_id": "P190417", "title": "Camera strap merchandise for Umurangi Generation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "camera-strap-merchandise-for-umurangi-generation", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "<p>Origame Digital</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2024-09-10", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2019-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Camera strap merchandise for Umurangi Generation</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2019</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Origame Digital</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Games Lab&nbsp;→ GL-01.

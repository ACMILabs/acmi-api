Footage of the gardens surrounding the Exhibition Building follows.</p>\n<p>00:19:13:00 Green trams are photographed moving along Swanston Street in Melbourne’s CBD, before further footage of the city’s decorations. 00:19:39:00 the reel ends with a final (rather jerkily-shot) scene of the Queen’s car – preceded by policemen on motorcycles – moving along a city street as a group of onlookers wave.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:56:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Urban transportation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "History&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "History&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "People&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "People&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "Places&nbsp;→ Flinders Street Railway Station (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, Vic.", "Places&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1431045, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1095, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/hVVlgSxs-gc"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

As proof that Bob Wootton is now in the family, Kenneth directs a kiss between him and his future mother-in-law to end the reel.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:</p>\n<p>00:04:12:00 women of the house posing in matching frocks and dodging bees where Kenneth has them pose.</p>\n<p>00:04:27:00 the women eating watermelon.</p>\n<p>00:04:54:00 one of the women wearing a uniform (possible of the WAAAF).</p>\n<p>00:06:30:00 example of 1940 style dress with gloves and bag.<br />\n00:07:04:00 another uniform shot interspersed with flowers and the pet rabbit.</p>\n<p>00:08:51:00 fruit trees are another feature of the garden and whilst collecting apricots, apples and green beans we see some examples of two piece sunsuits of the day.</p>\n<p>00:14:11:00 title card &#8216;Peter&#8217; begins a sequence featuring the family pet rabbit.</p>\n<p>00:16:18:00 shows Mrs Rankine in a large black car in the driveway before shots of the lawns covered in hailstones or sleet.</p>\n<p>00:16:31:00 title card &#8216;Kim&#8217; introduces us to the family dog and to a young Bob Wootton who would become part of the family when married to Kenneth&#8217;s daughter.</p>\n<p>00:17:30:00 title card &#8216;His First Bath&#8217; shows the dog being washed in two enamel bowls typical of the time.</p>\n<p>00:18:36:00 car being driven by Bob Wootton and members of the family in or near the car and playing with Kim.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:48:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Grampians (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mount Buffalo (Vic.)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Flower gardening", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardens - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Australia - History", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Recreation", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender roles in children", "History&nbsp;→ Clothing and dress - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Play", "Places&nbsp;→ Grampians (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Mount Buffalo (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1431030, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1101, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/kDtaHpGjolQ"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

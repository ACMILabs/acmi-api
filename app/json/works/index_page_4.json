Maybe they just need to smile more. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a huge swath of the internet came out in support of Tame’s directness – with stills from the footage shared across social media – likening her demeanour to their feelings towards the Coalition government. </p>\n<p>Throughout her tenure as Australian of the Year, Tame has been vocal about the government’s handling of sexual abuse allegations and its treatment of survivors. In April of 2021, when asked about Scott Morrison’s <a href=\"https://www.mamamia.com.au/brittany-higgins-scott-morrison/\">‘as a father’</a> response to rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins – which some believe he didn’t take seriously until <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-criticised-for-invoking-his-daughters-in-response-to-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations/f749bed4-feb5-4903-9338-0d03b10d795f\">“viewing it from the lens of being a father of daughters”</a> – Tame responded: “It shouldn’t take children to have a conscience. And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience.” Like this most recent interaction with the Prime Minister, that clip also went viral on the internet, helping solidify Tame’s position as a courageous advocate for sexual assault survivors and a moral champion at a time when many see Australia’s leaders as lacking both courage and morals.</p>\n<p>As Imogen Champagne writes in <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/01/27/grace-tame-side-eye-peter-van-onselen/\"><i>Crikey</i></a>:, &#8220;Conservatives have been trying to silence Grace Tame all year.

After Guo completed his creative piece, Zhou En the director of the Eighth Route Army subscriptions office, enthusiastically encourages and supports Guo’s production; emphasizing that revolution literary scholars like Guo can use their script writing talent as a weapon to attack their enemies.</p>\n<p>“Qu Yuan” finally proceeds on stage; and the show was a success across Chong Qing—spreading its fame throughout the whole of China. Subsequently, the fame of such a play which embedded controversial ideologies against the Nationalists ideals infuriated Jiang.  Jiang ordered Zhou En to force Guo to apologise and admit that they were wrong to produce such a play, but Zhou did not do as he was told.  Failing to force Guo, his supporters and the production to stop, Zhang Du, the advertising director of the Literary Cultural Conference tries to attack Guo’s moves by asking difficult questions.  A reporter asks whether Guo is a supporter of the Communist Party, Guo answers “Are all Buddhists monks in this world?” Guo replies all questions with ease and at ease, effectively using language, humour, wisdom and research to ‘dodge bullets’ fired at him by troublemakers at the conference.</p>\n<p>Guo attempts to break through the obstacles set for him and Chong Qing so that he can continue to preach his wisdom and political visions to other parts of China by moving Northward with his theatre production. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the theatre group set sail on a big ship, but police speedboats unexpectedly appear, making an attempt to stop them from leaving.  At once, theatre group troupes waved a flag vigorously in the air and dragon boats sailing next to their ship immediately turn their boats to face the police speedboats head-on.  As all dragon boats united to interfere with the police chase, it was an obvious picture that epitomize the strength of people power; the dragon boats are confronting police forces, and viewers can read that they are also working for what they believe is right—confronting corruption, injustice and power of the Nationalist Party.   While the dragon boats break the police chase, the theatre group is able to be on their way.  In the final scenes, Guo Moruo raises both hands into the heavens, showing his deep gratitude towards his Chinese comrades.<br />\n(Pearl Lau, 2013).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Sino-Japanese Conflict, 1937-1945", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 1}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1706361, "name": "Qin Wei", "creator_id": 82629, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production designer", "role_id": 966, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1706358, "name": "Yue Yu", "creator_id": 82626, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1706357, "name": "Ma Erlu", "creator_id": 82625, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1706356, "name": "Yabiao Wang", "creator_id": 82297, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1706355, "name": "Beijing Film Studio", "creator_id": 21396, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1706368, "name": "Xu Daolin", "creator_id": 82636, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706367, "name": "Su Lin", "creator_id": 82635, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706366, "name": "Zhao Jing", "creator_id": 82634, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706365, "name": "Chen Tianlu", "creator_id": 82633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706364, "name": "Dong Wenying", "creator_id": 82632, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706363, "name": "Yan Xiang", "creator_id": 82631, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706362, "name": "Wang Cheng", "creator_id": 82630, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706360, "name": "Philharmonic Orchestra of China", "creator_id": 82628, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1706359, "name": "Jia Kuan", "creator_id": 82627, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146443", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [55291]}, {"id": 73241, "acmi_id": "010294", "title": "The Story of Menstruation", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-story-of-menstruation", "creator_credit": "Walt Disney Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1946", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1946-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film was made as an outgrowth of Disney&#8217;s contract work with the armed forces during World War II. &#8220;The Story of menstruation&#8221; was probably the first American educational film with a woman narrator.

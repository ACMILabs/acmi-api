Jason Phu found it in martial arts films. By reclaiming wise sayings from movies and TV shows like &#8220;Drunken Master&#8221; (1978) and &#8220;Avatar the Last Airbender&#8221; (2005–08), &#8220;Analects of Kung Phu&#8221; presents a moving image philosophy for surviving contemporary life. Taught by action stars but inspired by classic Chinese texts like Lao Zi&#8217;s &#8220;Dao De Jing&#8221;, he questions whether these life lessons are genuinely useful. Phu is aware of how wisdom can be oversimplified and misused, how film subtitles miss the mark or even present a completely different narrative, and how we are guided in our day-to-day life by the movies we watch.</p>\n<p>Leading Melbourne-based visual artist Jason Phu&#8217;s multi-disciplinary practice includes printmaking, installation, painting and video. Born in 1989 in Sydney, Australia, Phu lives and works in Melbourne, Australia. Phu&#8217;s artworks often explore Chinese histories in Australia, his own family history, and Chinese/Vietnamese folktales. Jason Phu is the 2021 recipient of the Mordant Family Moving Image Commission for young Australian artists.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Jason Phu<br />\nThree-channel video installation, 85 mins.<br />\nEdited by Conor Bateman<br />\nMordant Family Moving Image Commission, ACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Three-channel video, colour and sound"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 656}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1742510, "name": "Jason Phu", "creator_id": 86084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1742511, "name": "Conor Bateman", "creator_id": 84346, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "186546", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2021", "notes": "", "to_year": "2021"}], "labels": [59205], "external_references": []}, {"id": 119198, "acmi_id": "Z000192", "title": "The Gods of Tiny Things", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-gods-of-tiny-things", "creator_credit": "Deborah Kelly", "credit_line": "<p>Deborah Kelly</p>\n<p>Two-channel digital animation, colour, sound</p>\n<p>ACMI Collection</p>\n<p>Collage figures: Joanne Albany, Alana Ambados, Kate Andrews, Justin Ashworth, Kathryn Bird, Karen Golland, Amanda Holt, Deborah Kelly, Kath Lim, Lex Lindsay, Megan Rushton, Rie Tamaoke, Anna Tregloan</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 3", "last_on_display_date": "2021-11-14", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "2-channel digital animation, colour, sound", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2019-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Deborah Kelly’s The Gods of Tiny Things is a vast, microscopic Eden teeming with deities born from the pages of old magazines and encyclopaedias, creating an exquisite collage of grotesque beauty and new mythologies.</p>", "constellations_primary": [{"id": 316, "name": "Speculative futures, sci-fi worlds and environmental disaster", "description": "Deborah Kelly's <I>The Gods of Tiny Things</i> explores extinction and the climate crisis, the scars of colonialism, and the political shift to the right around the world through collage and imagined futures, much like these sci-fi, animated and computer-generated artworks."}], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Gods of Tiny Things</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Deborah Kelly</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2019</p>", "description": "<p>&#8220;<i>This work is blessed by the powers of the animator, musicians and collagists.

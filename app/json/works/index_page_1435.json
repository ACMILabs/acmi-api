There are also scenes of children playing in a Mirror or possibly a Sabot sailing boat dry-docked in a suburban back yard.</p>\n<p>There are sequences of slalom ski events, chair lift and poma lift rides, and family leisure time spent inside the ski lodge.</p>\n<p>We see ski races with slalom pole banners with “Molony Ski Shop&#8221; signage, and &#8220;Start&#8221; and “Finish” banners and flags with “Henke Schuhe” signage. A ski instructor wearing a red Parka teaching parallel turns. The old ski jump is visible down the valley.</p>\n<p>A group of family and friends go down the Valley of the Moon ski run. A child navigates the tricky bits, then skis along the narrow raceline to the village. We see currawongs in the trees, a village, and return on the chairlift.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker experiments with some in-camera slow-motion techniques, and amongst the crowd of onlookers and prize givers, we see people using what could be a Standard 8 camera or a 16mm Bolex camera, as well as 35mm SLR cameras.</p>\n<p>There are some beautiful ski scenes filmed against blue skies amongst eucalypts and beside streams. A high shot provides an excellent view of the slalom course with flags and banners. We see a lovely panorama of green hills patched with snow in the background and views of the ski feild from the Snowhaven deck.</p>\n<p>The film shows some great scenes of a man in charge of a “Snow mobile” as he starts it up and tows four skiers behind him. They traverse the beautiful snow-covered countryside in formation, across towards Mt McKay. Looking down over Sun Valley and a very long tow queue.</p>\n<p>In a suburban backyard seemingly far from the snow fields, the film shows two children playing in a dry-docked Fireball sailing boat. We see the young boy strapped into the boat’s flying trapeze harness as he swings from the edge of the boat. The children play with a toy ambulance and ride down the street (Cleeve Court) on their bicycles.

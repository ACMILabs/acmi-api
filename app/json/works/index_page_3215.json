This documentary discusses the past and present community of Flemingdon Park, as well as the challenges the diverse residents face and the valuable lessons offered by the community that has developed there. From a history of overcoming violence and racism to the hope of the celebration of difference in increasingly inclusive and welcoming community attitudes there are many and varied facets to life in and around the Park. Many of these elements are touched on in this program in order to come to terms with the history and current experience of the community through interviews with past and present residents, teachers and students from neighbouring schools, the Park&#8217;s designer and architect and through commentary from journalist Robert Fulford and the documentary&#8217;s director, Andrew Faiz, himself a former resident.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Housing", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Architects and housing developers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Race relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Housing", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Public housing", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Housing", "Places&nbsp;→ Toronto (Ont.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816700, "name": "Gerry Flahive", "creator_id": 80524, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817339, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817341, "name": "Andrew Faiz", "creator_id": 80525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817338, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51695", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33373], "external_references": []}, {"id": 67617, "acmi_id": "003816", "title": "Flax", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "flax", "creator_credit": "Strand Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1944", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1944-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Opens with scenes of the flax industry in pre-war Ireland.

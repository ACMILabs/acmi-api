This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film is made up of two distinct parts, both showing off the beauty and destinations of Tasmania and both capturing the courtship and marriage of the main people in the films, Val and Len.</p>\n<p>In the first part, Kenneth uses a series of ‘intertitle’ cards to introduce his viewers to a conversation between ‘Valerie Sparks’ and ‘Len Couchman’ about Tasmania, which is ‘beyond the blue horizon’. What follows is a scenic tour of Tasmania interjected by moments of Valerie and Len sitting on a bench looking out to sea, continuing to talk of Tasmania over the course of a few days. During these chats, Valerie and Len become closer and end the first part of the film with arms around each other’s shoulders.</p>\n<p>The second part of the film, title card ‘KenRa Films Present’ appears before we see Valerie and then Len in close-ups followed by title card, ‘Val. and Len. Couchman in’ and ‘”The Sequel” to The Blue Horizon’, thus showing the audience that the single Val and Len of the first film have now married.</p>\n<p>As well as showing Tasmania as an interesting travel spot, both parts of this film include wonderful examples of late 1940s scenes - piers, shipping and boats, cars, trucks and Hobarts historic (and no longer used) trams, streets, shops and signs – all of which show the styles of living and working at the time.</p>\n<p>Another point of historic interest is that of the fashion displayed by both men and women at the wedding. The bride chooses a cocktail style ensemble in blue rather than a long white dress and she and her attendant (Bettye Rankine Wootton) carry smaller floral bouquet in the style of a corsage. The guests wear low key but elegant outfits, the women in ‘frocks’ and suits that go well with matching hats, gloves, bags, shoes and sometimes corsages and the men in double breasted suits that indicate a particular style of the era.</p>\n<p>Another point of interest in the film is the scenes of the operation of the ‘Bridgewater Bridge and Causeway’ over the Derwent River between Bridgewater and Granton north of Hobart and which was fully operational at the time. Construction on the steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939 and completed in 1946. It consists of a long concrete bridge that leads off the end of the causeway, and a steel lifting section just before the northern bank of the river. The lifting section is one of only a few remaining in the Southern Hemisphere, and is the largest of its kind remaining in Australia.</p>\n<p>Finally. at Port Arthur the camera focuses on the crumbling masonry and ruins of the buildings which seems to capture the awful history of the site.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 pre-title certificate -

What follows is a scenic tour of Tasmania interjected by moments of Valerie and Len sitting on a bench looking out to sea, continuing to talk of Tasmania over the course of a few days.

The bride chooses a cocktail style ensemble in blue rather than a long white dress and she and her attendant (Bettye Rankine Wootton) carry smaller floral bouquet in the style of a corsage.

Construction on the steel vertical lift bridge across the Derwent began in 1939 and completed in 1946.

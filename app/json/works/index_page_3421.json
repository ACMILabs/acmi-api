We look at anti-aliasing techniques which solve this and algorithms which solve the problems of limited time and memory. We then look at three programs from Symbolics Inc. - &#8220;Geometry&#8221; which creates 3D objects, &#8220;Dynamics&#8221; which moves them and &#8220;Render&#8221; which makes them realistic. Demonstrated techniques include splining, translation, scaling, rotation, texture mapping and opacity.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Management", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Computer graphics", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Programming (Electronic computers)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 781981, "name": "COMAP", "creator_id": 24469, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781982, "name": "Chedd-Angier Productions", "creator_id": 23871, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 781983, "name": "Joseph Blatt", "creator_id": 24473, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 781980, "name": "Educational Media Australia", "creator_id": 11964, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39241", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [22809], "external_references": []}, {"id": 83388, "acmi_id": "304624", "title": "For all practical purposes.

The film stars the then real-life married couple, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Literature&nbsp;→ Austrian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "People&nbsp;→ Freud, Sigmund, 1856-1939"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 812946, "name": "Hobby Films", "creator_id": 66909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812947, "name": "Pole Star", "creator_id": 66907, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812948, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812949, "name": "Stanley Kubrick", "creator_id": 66943, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 812945, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50312", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32294]}, {"id": 67330, "acmi_id": "003482", "title": "Eyes that hear", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "eyes-that-hear", "creator_credit": "Campus Film Productions, Lexington School for the Deaf and Nat Campus", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1946", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1946-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>An introduction to the work being done in schools for the deaf in America.

Liu, a kung-fu master himself, also tried to find the thief, but in the meantime, a couple of young ladies have been killed by darts that belonged to Liu. Liu was imprisoned, but was saved by his daughter together with a young man. They went to Mr. Yang’s boat and found the authentic woodcarving but were poisoned by an old man on the boat. It turned out that the thief was the county magistrate, who wanted to sell the woodcarving to foreigners. After a big fight, Liu with his daughter and the young man eventually killed the magistrate and Mr. Yang and saved the treasure.</p>\n<p>Fan Zhongyan’s (AD. 989-1052, Song Dynasty) &#8216;Travel Notes on Yueyang Building&#8217; is a very well-known prose and has a unique place in Chinese literature. Fan’s famous sentence in the prose, “one should be the first in his/her country to worry about state affairs, and the last to enjoy oneself” is widely quoted and has become the motto for many Chinese people.</p>\n<p>The film well combines different genres such as suspense, martial arts and melodrama.

When the Mayor visits the complex, however, he discovers that selfish council members and their families have begun to move into the apartments, although they were intended for those whose houses were damaged by the flood. Disgusted, he throws them out. Meanwhile, the residents prepare for the move. Thoroughly excited, they secretly curse the municipal cadres for being selfish.</p>\n<p>The site workers protest their long working hours. They were promised more pay for more work, but did not receive it. Their supervisor is enraged, calling them selfish, working only for a bonus and not for the cause, like men used to in the past.</p>\n<p>The council discusses the construction of the freeway flyover. They praise the constructions design as innovative, thinking it similar to a lotus flower. The men are shocked to discover the designer is none other than Liu Shan. Unfortunately, however, Liu Shan has cancer, and only has a week to live. The Mayor visits her in hospital, thanking her for her great work and promising her the best medical care in the world to help her recover. She is grateful to receive the recognition she deserves.</p>\n<p>At the opening ceremony for the Flyover, the workers are denied entry for being too sloppily dressed. Despite all their hard work, they are given no recognition. When the Mayor finds out, he visits the workers, insisting they all cut the ribbon together. Suring the ceremony, the Mayor reflects on the city&#8217;s great achievements but laments that the designer (Liu Shan) could not be there to see her finished product. THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>This film is incredibly unique. While it has a discernible plot and knowable characters, it plays out like a kind of advertisement, illustrating a newly modern Shanghai while praising the great achievements of the Chinese Government who made it happen. It paints a positive portrait of the Chinese Government as a body whose chief aim is the wellbeing of its people. The film suggests the Government is willing to pull up their sleeves and work alongside the masses.</p>\n<p>Shanghai&#8217;s modernity is made evident in the large number of establishing shots of the city, the added voiceover providing a highly propagandistic commentary on its beauty.</p>\n<p>The film is also imbued with a Communist touch. Subtly critical of capitalist ambition, it suggests that men should work for a cause and not just to be paid.<br />\n(2 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 28, 2012)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>A 1990 big city = Da Cheng shi</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Changchun Film Studio and Sun Sha</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1990</p>", "description": "<p>A slice of life portrait of Shanghai in 1990 that illustrates its many and varied people, and their daily struggles.

It focuses on the history of the development of cities in Britain under the Roman Empire and their development of the notion of the country being a unified entity, a province governed from the centre rather than being separately managed tribal lands. This was symbolised most strikingly by the Roman&#8217;s establishment of the port town of London as a capital city and the legacy of 400 years worth of road construction across the country for ease of trade and travel between districts. The program also looks at the influence of the Roman empire over food preparation, the establishment of bath houses, architectural traditions, dynamics of the marketplace and the establishment of industrial complexes in early Britain. In the process the merging of the Celtic cultural landscape with that of Rome is examined, with discussion of the acknowledgement of the different cultures within the constructions of the Roman Empire in Britain as each country became a visible part of the other.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Coming of age</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Paul Manners and BBC-TV</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 1999</p>", "description": "<p>Episode number 2 of Series &#8220;The Romans in Britain&#8221;.<br />\nThe second program in the Roman&#8217;s in Britain series which discusses the progression of the Roman rule over Britain over 4 centuries.

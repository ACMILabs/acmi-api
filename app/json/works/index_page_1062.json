Panic and chaos ensue, and lives are lost, as frantic efforts are made to raise the cash. The plot has an interesting twist and the characters are made up of an eclectic mix. Based on the novel by John Gody with screenplay by Peter Stone, the film although full of suspense and drama laced with the odd moment of humour, unfortunately falls down when some of this humour involves racial slurring. Cast also includes Martin Balsam (Mr Green), Hector Elizondo (Mr Grey) and Earl Hindman (Mr Brown) and Lee Wallace (New York City Mayor).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-taking-of-pelham-one-two-three", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963761, "name": "Palomar Pictures", "creator_id": 26923, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963762, "name": "Palladium Productions", "creator_id": 36201, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963763, "name": "Gabriel Katzka", "creator_id": 79066, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963764, "name": "Edgar J.

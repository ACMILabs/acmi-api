Pepperland was a paradise until the &#8220;Meanies&#8221; moved in and everyone had given up hope. Until the Beatles arrived in their yellow submarine to save the day. It is a fascinating but uneven anthology of contemporary art and graphic design up to the late sixties - surrealism, art nouveau, op and pop art - brought together by designer Edelman&#8217;s flattened comic strip, Lennon style whimsy out of Lear and Carroll and play upon the Beatles&#8217; myth.

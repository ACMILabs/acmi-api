Yu then called on the Chinese Communist leaders in Hong Kong for their assistance in his new government. The CPC Central Committee of the Communist Party decided to assign the then Secretary-General, Deng Xiao-ping and a large number of communist members under his leadership to assist Yu’s office.</p>\n<p>On the Guomingtang (National Party) side Jiang Jie-she (Chiang Kai-Shek) also appointed his henchman Deng Jie-ming to restrain Yu’s power.</p>\n<p>Deng Xiao-ping first stopped at Nanning (the capital city of Gui Territory) and met up with the underground communists Lei and Yu Zuo-yu to discuss about the current situation. They settled on a number of strategies to remove the newly-appointed Yu in order to unite Gui under the CPC.</p>\n<p>Another active member of the Communist underground was Zhang Yun-yi, who was busy refining the army force according to CPC instructions. At Yu’s office, he consulted his assistance Deng Xiao-ping, who used the name Deng Bing to hide his identity, for advice to prevent the potential upheaval of the prominent landlords in the area. Deng suggested Yu to gather and arm the peasants in order to balance out the power of the landlords and Yu followed suit.</p>\n<p>Jiang Jie-shi (Chiang Kai-Chek) was growing worried about this development of the Gui Territory, so he commanded Deng Jie-ming, his henchman to decrease the ration to the army and bribe the high officers under Yu’s leadership. Under the threats from both the landlords and Jiang, Yu took the risk to rival against Jiang but unfortunately failed.</p>\n<p>Deng Xiao-ping took the opportunity to allocate the communist army to the West Gui Area and established the communist government.</p>\n<p>(Pearl Lau, 2013).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Places&nbsp;→ China", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 836059, "name": "Guangxi Film Studio", "creator_id": 33557, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 836060, "name": "Chen Jialin", "creator_id": 82421, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 836061, "name": "Hou Yuzhong", "creator_id": 82780, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 836062, "name": "Zhu Xuming", "creator_id": 82781, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 836063, "name": "Jin Fucai", "creator_id": 82782, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 836064, "name": "Lu Qi", "creator_id": 82783, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 836065, "name": "Guo Shaoxiong", "creator_id": 82784, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 836066, "name": "Xu Daolin", "creator_id": 82636, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 836067, "name": "Tang Tangmin", "creator_id": 82785, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 836068, "name": "Li Liangtao", "creator_id": 82786, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146468", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [55314], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65196, "acmi_id": "000973", "title": "The Badminton Horse Trials", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-badminton-horse-trials", "creator_credit": "Town and Country Productions and Bill Latto", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1962", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A record of the three-day event at the 1962 Badminton Horse Trials, showing famous riders and their mounts in training and the preparations made for transport and stabling.

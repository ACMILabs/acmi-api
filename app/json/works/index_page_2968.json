Capturing twelve Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, the film won Oscars for Best Actor (Schell) and Best Screenplay. In this stirring courtroom drama, acclaimed producer/director Stanely Kramer dared to ask one of the most emotionally charged questions of our century: who was responsible for the Holocaust? The story centres on the trial of four Nazi judges accused of war crimes, men who willingly distorted the law to perpetuate the greatest atrocity ever committed against humanity.

The High Court&#8217;s Wik decision in 1996 removed long held assumptions about land tenure in Australia and created uncertainty in the minds of pastoralists and miners. First Nations groups however, believed that the decision would have little impact and that the farmers were generally over-reacting. Co-existence in the form of upgraded land tenure for the pastoralists and traditional access to the land for First Nations people could lead to long-term stability - at least that was the aim of the Cape York Agreement.

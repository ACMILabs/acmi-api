James Toback&#8217;s (Two girls and a guy, Black and white) debut feature is a fascinating view of a man at war with himself and features a stunning lead performance by Keitel. Like Scorsese&#8217;s early work (such as Who&#8217;s That Knocking at My Door? and Mean Streets) Toback utilises the New York setting to explore one man&#8217;s mental deterioration, a theme echoed two years earlier in &#8220;Taxi Driver&#8221;. Cast also includes Tisa Farrow, Jim Brown and Michael Vincente Gazzo.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Anger", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Anger", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental illness", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2240864, "name": "James Toback", "creator_id": 35230, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1387412", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2240862, "name": "George Barrie", "creator_id": 36243, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315339", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2240859, "name": "Brut Films", "creator_id": 36242, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222805", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2240856, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52210", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [33823]}, {"id": 92373, "acmi_id": "315630", "title": "Finding Forrester [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "finding-forrester-dvd", "creator_credit": "Gus Van Sant, Laurence Mark, Rhonda Tollefson, Sean Connery, Columbia Pictures, Fountainbridge Films and Laurence Mark Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47957, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1140439"}], "brief_description": "<p>Basketball star and &#8216;C&#8217; student Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) surprises everyone except himself when his amazing writing abilities and basketball prowess attract the attention of a Manhattan private school.

These scenarios act as a means for director Bertrand van Effenterre to examine the complexities inherent within communication between the sexes and the tribulations of relationships for women, but also for men facing female emancipation. The narrative, brimming with intriguing and humorous insights into the plights faced by women struggling to discover ways in which they might find their identity and even happiness, is bolstered by strong key performances. Also stars: Jean-Francois Stevenin, Didier Flamand, Jean-Jacques Biraud and Claire Denis.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Feminism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929130, "name": "Mallia Films", "creator_id": 36563, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929131, "name": "Bertrand van Effenterre", "creator_id": 80851, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52492", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [34040]}, {"id": 70014, "acmi_id": "006609", "title": "Maintenance of office machines", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "maintenance-of-office-machines", "creator_credit": "De Frenes and United States.

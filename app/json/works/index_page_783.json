Elliot confounds viewer expectations offering up more extreme and vulgar outback personalities than could possibly be imagined, making these characters repugnant to watch. The film slyly sends up films such as &#8220;Crocodile Dundee&#8221; which pandered to the gross stereotypes that so appealed to audiences. Elliot however failed to appeal to anyone with this bizarre and subversive flick, receiving critical brickbats and woeful box office returns.<br />\nCast includes: Johnathon Schaech, Rod Taylor, Susie Porter,  Richard Moir, Maggie Kirkpatrick, Barry Humphries and Paul Mercurio</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/welcome-to-woop-woop", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1820418, "name": "Finola Dwyer", "creator_id": 71846, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962954, "name": "Scala Productions", "creator_id": 35620, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962955, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962956, "name": "Unthank Films", "creator_id": 35621, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962958, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2094420", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33223], "external_references": [{"id": 236, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2902017"}, {"id": 6590, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "6970"}]}]}

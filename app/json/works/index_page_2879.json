Paul (British actor Paul MacFadyen), a war photographer, returns to his isolated hometown in New Zealand for his father&#8217;s funeral. He left the town when his mother committed suicide and his brother (Colin Moy), who remained behind, does not welcome his return warmly. Staying on for a longer time that he anticipated, Paul starts a friendship with his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s illegitimate 16-year-old daughter Celia (Emily Barclay). Celia is a typical angst-ridden teenager with a sharp mind and yearning to explore the wider world - not unlike Paul in his youth. When Celia disappears, Paul becomes the main suspect and the town turns against him. An adaptation of Maurice Gee&#8217;s novel of the same name, first time feature writer/director Brad McGann has created a cinematic treat, building unspoken tensions and fears as the story unfolds. Cast includes Miranda Otto.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:02:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War photographers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ War photographers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community and school", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal relations in adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Literature&nbsp;→ New Zealand literature - Film and video adaptations", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - New Zealand"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1804849, "name": "Dixie Linder", "creator_id": 79542, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1804847, "name": "Trevor Haysom", "creator_id": 79756, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930008, "name": "New Zealand Film Commission", "creator_id": 3023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930009, "name": "UK Film Council", "creator_id": 69388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 930012, "name": "Brad McGann", "creator_id": 81142, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q303695", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 930007, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53111", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [34555], "external_references": [{"id": 3088, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1809132"}]}, {"id": 77932, "acmi_id": "016350", "title": "In memory of Mawalan: a ceremony for Wandjuk's father", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-memory-of-mawalan-a-ceremony-for-wandjuks-father-a", "creator_credit": "Film Australia and Ian Dunlop", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In 1971 Wandjuk Marika organised a Djangkawu ceremony at Yirrkala in memory of his father, Mawalan who died in 1967.

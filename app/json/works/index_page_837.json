After many burials and unearthings of the corpse, and a few blossoming romances between the major characters, the real cause of Harry&#8217;s death is revealed, and Harry troubles nobody again. &#8220;The Trouble with Harry&#8221; is a quirky comedy-mystery set in the autumnal splendour of New England. It is a decidedly different film from Hitchcock, in which Shirley Maclaine makes her screen debut. Includes music score by Bernard Herrmann. Cast includes Edmund Gwen, John Forsythe, Shirley Maclaine, Mildred Natwick and Jerry Mathers. Based on the novel by Jack Trevor.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:50:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956731, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956732, "name": "Alfred J Hitchcock Productions", "creator_id": 23696, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956733, "name": "Alfred Hitchcock", "creator_id": 72561, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956730, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44489", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1955", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1955"}], "labels": [27354]}, {"id": 86218, "acmi_id": "307865", "title": "The Trouble with boys", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-trouble-with-boys", "creator_credit": "Media Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1997", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Concern is increasing that boys are not coping with traditional schooling, and growing up in general.

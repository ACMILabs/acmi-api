The program includes interviews with fellow crime writer P.D. James (who is not necessarily a big fan of the writer but can appreciate the &#8220;fairy tale&#8221; aspect to the work), editors, performers, critics and an international vox pop. The program looks at the tenets of Christie&#8217;s novels and provides solid biographical details to ascertain why she was compelled to write what she did so prolifically.

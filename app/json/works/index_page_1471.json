No-one likes his depiction of them, and in an hilariously ironic mixture of flashbacks to his new novel, flashbacks to his past, and mishaps in the present, the true story comes out. In classic Allen style, this autobiographical story is a fascinating mixture of fiction and reality. The cast is another line-up of characters in itself, including Kirstie Alley, Demi Moore, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Elisabeth Shue, Stanley Tucci, Amy Irving, Julie Kavner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mariel Hemingway and Judy Davis.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/deconstructing-harry", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1991708, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25089", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991707, "name": "Jean Doumanian", "creator_id": 29398, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6170556", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991706, "name": "Sweetland Films BV", "creator_id": 27595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1991705, "name": "Magnolia Productions", "creator_id": 27594, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1991704, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43839", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [26894], "external_references": [{"id": 24249, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q551762"}]}, {"id": 94340, "acmi_id": "318165", "title": "Decasia", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "decasia", "creator_credit": "Hypnotic Pictures and Bill Morrison", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This mesmerising experimental film was originally conceived as a live performance in which a fifty-five piece orchestra performed an avant-garde symphony written by Michael Gordon accompanied by large-scale film and slide projections by Bill Morrison.

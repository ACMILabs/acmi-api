Concern was being expressed about the demise of small country towns and their future, economically,<br />\nsocially and environmentally and the main intention of the<br />\nProject was to develop a toolkit for measuring the &#8220;health&#8221; of a community - a benchmark for sustainability. With the assistance of Judy Spokes and the Cultural Development Network seven artists were commissioned to work with the communities and the researchers. Workshops were established incorporating the community, including the Energy Footprint Project and a Community Cohesion Project.

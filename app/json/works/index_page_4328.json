The bashing ends in the young Marine&#8217;s death. It looks like a simple case but a methodical US Navy lawyer (Demi Moore) is keen to investigate the killing, convinced that the bashing was a result of a &#8220;Code Red&#8221;, an unofficial system of bastardry which aims to convert the young marines into effective fighting machines. &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221; is a detective story, a film about responsibility and conduct, and it features some powerful and adrenalin-pumping courtroom drama. Tom Cruise is suitably boyish and charming as a maverick Navy lawyer and Jack Nicholson is outstanding as a US General arrogantly convinced of his superiority and power.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Military life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Navies", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Courtroom films and programs", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953541, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953542, "name": "Castle Rock Entertainment", "creator_id": 52854, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953543, "name": "Rob Reiner", "creator_id": 24063, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953544, "name": "David Brown", "creator_id": 3944, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953545, "name": "Andrew Scheinman", "creator_id": 77060, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953546, "name": "Rob Reiner", "creator_id": 24063, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953540, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41039", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [24551]}]}

Dwindling numbers of church-goers has caused the Catholic Church to take desperate measures to ensure its survival, beginning the &#8216;Catholicism Wow&#8217; campaign, in an attempt to boost the church&#8217;s profile. Renegade angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck), banished from Heaven following an argument with God and forced to spend eternity in Wisconsin, discover a loophole in dogmatic law that will allow them to re-enter Heaven, by passing through the arch of a New Jersey Cathedral. Unfortunately God- who happens to be a woman- has failed to return from her monthly visit to earth to play arcade games. As a result the fate of the human race relies on the last descendent of Christ, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), who has lost her faith. Metatron (Alan Rickman), a Seraphim and the voice of God, informs Bethany of her responsibilities and that she will be assisted by two prophets, Jay (Jason Mewes) and his hetro-life partner Silent Bob (played by director Kevin Smith). The unlikely trio head to New Jersey, to stop Bartleby and Loki from entering the church, because if they do, they will have proven God fallible and will wipe out all human existence.

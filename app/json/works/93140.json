Three days before the nuptials, on the night of his stag party, Neil has his drink spiked by best friend Gary, and is left stranded naked on a remote Scottish island. Neil has to somehow make his way back to London for his wedding, aided by the kindness of strangers. Naturally Neil falls into all manner of strife en route - he&#8217;s arrested, has an arm broken, survives an armed robbery, and steals several cars.

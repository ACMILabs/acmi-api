population, the Snowy Rovers and Orbost Football Clubs were driven to merge into the Orbost Snowy Rovers. This is a story of small town trauma and redemption.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Peter Jenkins, Edna Towns, Rita Baker, Gary Squires, and Glen Davie. Archival video and still images reproduced courtesy of Orbost Snowy Rovers Football Club and &#8220;The Snowy River Mail&#8221;.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[INTERPOSING VOICES] PETER JENKINS:  I think from background&#8212; well, the Snowy Rovers have always been very much a working-class team. A lot of the guys worked out in the bush, worked in the mills, you know, that line of work, physical hard, physical work, sort of went and played at the Snowy Rovers, whereas the bank people, the accountants and schoolteachers, all tended to come to the Orbost footy club. And it was pretty full-on rivalry.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS:  Friday nights, I think you would have found that Rovers went up to the top hotel and the Orbost boys went down to the bottom hotel. You probably went to one butcher if he was a member of the Rovers, or a member of the Orbost, say, you went to him.</p>\n<p>But it was really one eyed football, wasn&#8217;t it? But then once football was over, we were all friends again, because we all live in the same town, after all, don&#8217;t we?

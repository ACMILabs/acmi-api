scene shows children playing in their backyard under a homemade cubby house constructed of bed sheets, cardboard and possibly curtains.

There is some lovely footage of the child standing on the garden path surrounded by flowers. A butterfly joins in as the toddler stops to pick some flowers.</p>\n<p>The film shows some backyard above-ground swimming pool action. Children enjoy themselves duck-diving for coins, wearing diving masks and somersaulting under water. We see a delightful interaction between siblings as they sit in the sunshine and eat biscuits together.</p>\n<p>We see a young child standing beside their mother. She is gardening dressed in her full-piece 1960s swimming costume.</p>\n<p>Three children play together in a wading or paddling pool, filling it up with water from the nearby garden hose. They take great delight in creating a flood, squirting each other with water, splashing and jettisoning the water into the air. They play piggy-back in the pool, use plastic kickboards and sit in an improvised plastic boat.</p>\n<p>The film shows scenes of children swimming laps in an outdoor inbuilt swimming pool which could be at St Catherine’s School, Toorak. We can see some impressive buildings in the background which could be a part of the school or neighbouring houses.</p>\n<p>There is a lovely scene of a young boy riding his tricycle along a leafy suburban street, lined with large houses. The street could be Cleeve Court in Toorak.</p>\n<p>We see a young girl playing on a swing surrounded by a beautiful garden in full bloom.</p>\n<p>The film finishes with a trip to the country for horse riding lessons.

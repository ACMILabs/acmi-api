He went on to act in a number of Australian feature films including &#8216;Mad Dog Morgan&#8217; (1976), &#8216;Storm Boy&#8217; (1977), &#8216;The Last Wave&#8217; (1977), &#8216;Crocodile Dundee&#8217; (1986) and &#8216;Rabbit-Proof Fence&#8217; (2002). Most recently he won the AFI award for best actor for his performance in &#8216;The Tracker&#8217; (2002). When he is not acting, Gulpilil lives a demanding traditional life in Arnhem Land, Northern Australia where he is an elder of the Yolngu clan. Following Gulpilil from the set of &#8216;The Tracker&#8217; back to his community the film reveals how the actor negotiates the two very different worlds he moves between. Interviews with Phillip Noyce, Rolf De Heer, Marcia Langton, Gary Foley, Jack Thompson, and others, as well as with Gulpilil, are interspersed with clips from films in which the actor has appeared.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians in motion pictures", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Australia - History", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social conditions", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "People&nbsp;→ Gulpilil", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2507001, "name": "Darlene Johnson", "creator_id": 8650, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120358915", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2507002, "name": "David Gulpilil", "creator_id": 60298, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2507000, "name": "Tom Zubrycki", "creator_id": 20426, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16107529", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2506999, "name": "Jotz Productions", "creator_id": 23824, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2507010, "name": "David Gulpilil", "creator_id": 60298, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507004, "name": "Robert Humphreys", "creator_id": 80488, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315019", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2506998, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507008, "name": "Gary Foley", "creator_id": 72039, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035135", "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507009, "name": "Jack Thompson", "creator_id": 72924, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q356383", "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507007, "name": "Marcia Langton", "creator_id": 73345, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222603", "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507005, "name": "Phil Noyce", "creator_id": 11119, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q543563", "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507006, "name": "Rolf De Heer", "creator_id": 10241, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1374169", "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2507003, "name": "Darlene Johnson", "creator_id": 8650, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120358915", "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51480", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33289]}, {"id": 109580, "acmi_id": "B1006540", "title": "The Tonight Show", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-tonight-show", "creator_credit": "George Lazarides", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The &#8220;Tonight Show&#8221; is an interactive &#8216;late night&#8217; show set in the year 2040 on Coode Island.

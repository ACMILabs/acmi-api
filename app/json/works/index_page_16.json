Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This film shows various visitations to South Western Victoria stretching from Cape Otway to Geelong.</p>\n<p>The film begins in Apollo Bay and continues with visits to the Barham River, Cape Otway, Mariner’s lookout and lighthouse, Geelong, Carisbrook Falls and Great Ocean Road with the Twelve Apostles.</p>\n<p>The film includes many scenic views of the sea, beaches, mountains and forests. There are several scenes with groups cooking food outdoors and eating throughout.</p>\n<p>Of interest is the fashion of the time including men and women’s bathers (swimwear) and the wooden body boards and kayaks used.</p>\n<p>Also seen is the T&amp;I mutual Life Society clock tower in Geelong with the famous Father and Son figurine bell ringers coming out to ring the bell.</p>\n<p>The film finishes with a scene showing the result of rough seas with capsized boats and debris.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 Apollo Bay shopping strip with old vintage cars<br />\n00:01:55:00

"<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains family gatherings for birthdays and weddings as well as Christmas in 1979, a picnic in the Eastern Gardens in Geelong, a trip to Cairns and a tennis tournament in Launceston, Tasmania.

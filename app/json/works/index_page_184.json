The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film shows us the wedding of Gwen, one of the Gadsden family.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:10:00 women walking through the garden, dressed-up and smiling at the camera (these are presumably wedding guests arriving)<br />\n00:00:19:00 a close up of the bride in a blue wedding dress<br />\n00:00:21:00 the following 20 seconds or so of footage is badly under-exposed and very little action can be distinguished<br />\n00:00:42:00 the bride and groom pose in front of the church<br />\n00:00:54:00 the following 10 seconds or so of footage is badly under-exposed and very little action can be distinguished<br />\n00:01:05:00 we see the bride and groom, now dressed in casual clothes, loading-up and settling into a car with a full trailer attached (the car is a distinctive model Ford).

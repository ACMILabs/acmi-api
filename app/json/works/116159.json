Becker, in his last film before his death in 1960 (aged 54), seemed to be taking a new direction by using non-professional actors and a more austere camera style.

His focus upon the realities of criminal life was never a social crusade.

Its almost immediate sale to the cinema seemed equally fortuitous: director Jacques Becker had saved a newspaper clipping about the Sante prison break. When the book appeared he summoned the still jittery ex-con to a story meeting &#8230; at the home of Yves Montand and Simone Signoret.(&#8230;) When you are in jail, Jose Giovanni says, and a new person comes into your cell, whether it is a guard or a prisoner, you have to learn how to size them up with a single glance.

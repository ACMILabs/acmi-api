Mary Henry&#8217;s inability to remember anything about her ordeal doesn&#8217;t stop her ambition to become a church organist in Utah. Apparitions of a ghostly zombie (played by director Herk Harvey) begin to appear and her failed attempts to ignore him tell us something more sinister is at play than B-grade 1960s horror. The fascination with an abandoned carnival, her indifference to spirituality and religion and her lack of interest in the jovial and sleazy neighbour Mr. Linden reflect the discontinuity of her life following the accident. The subtle use of an organ throughout the soundtrack maintains a constant state of tension and suspense and adds to the religious and morbid undertones. Harvey uses dreamlike sequences, where Mary enters a ghost world and cannot be seen or heard, which effectively highlights her feelings of marginalisation and creates an image of hysteria and mass paranoia - an effect which has become cliche in horror and suspense. The abandoned carnival which fills Mary with guilt and fear represents her deserted dead girlfriends - the cinematography which conjures up Hitchcock&#8217;s use of shots featuring the individual enclosed within their environment to create a sense of loneliness, as in Vertigo and Frenzy. Hilligoss&#8217; (Mary Henry) amateur performance sees her immaculately make the transformation from a confused yet strong willed character to a maniacal woman who can&#8217;t escape her demons while sparing watchers too many dramatic exaggerated facial close-ups.

John, Mick, Paul, Jim and Kerry are workers employed by Brit Rail; when BR is privatised the men find themselves being lured by offers of voluntary redundancy (for large cash sums). Then, working for a private company, and sub-contractors, they are virtually without rights in the workplace, increasingly subject to unstable employment conditions, and despite the overtures of management, are subjected to progressively unsafe workplace practices. Loach explores their private lives, which range from happily married to disgruntled fathers separated from their children, as a way of highlighting the additional burden on families of economic rationalism. Given the subject matter the tone of the film is light and satirical; Loach mines the topic for laughs but never at the expense of keeping his protagonists or their situations, believable, producing an entertaining but at the same time scathing work. Deleted scenes provide some interesting back-stories to the main themes, but also highlight Loach&#8217;s skill in keeping the story focused and tight. Script written by ex-British Rail employee Rob Dawber. Cast includes Dean Andrews, Tom Craig, Joe Duttine, Steve Huison and Venn Tracey.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Realism in motion pictures", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroads", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Privatisation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Rationalism - Economic aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-navigators", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999387, "name": "Ken Loach", "creator_id": 72757, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55238", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999386, "name": "Rebecca O'Brien", "creator_id": 28484, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2134946", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999385, "name": "Alta Films", "creator_id": 36426, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999384, "name": "Tornasol Films", "creator_id": 36425, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999383, "name": "Road Movies Filmproduktion", "creator_id": 4492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999382, "name": "Parallax Pictures", "creator_id": 20477, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999381, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52352", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33937], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94430, "acmi_id": "318284", "title": "Donnie Darko [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "donnie-darko-dvd", "creator_credit": "Richard Kelly, Sean McKittrick, Nancy Juvonen, Adam Fields, Pandora Cinema and Flower Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The titular character of &#8220;Donnie Darko&#8221; is a troubled teenager who sleepwalks, suffers from apparant schizophrenia, struggles with his familial relations and is beset by visions of a six-foot demonic rabbit.

Simultaneously Yehia (played by the director himself) finds himself attracted to two actors - the handsome young Amr, who Yehia works with on laboured productions, and Nadia, with whom he hopes to collaborate. Following on from the themes explored in &#8220;An Egyptian story&#8221;, Yahia heartlessly forfeits his personal relationships in favour of his work.

In Dogtown, twelve teenage friends, many from broken homes, zealously surfed their dilapidated well-protected turf. Known as the Zephyr Boys - or Z-Boys for short - these teenage boys and one girl, applied their well-honed surfing skills to skateboarding and a fad that had all but died out was reborn. Fuelled by competitive drive and pushing each other to perform increasingly daring feats, the crew were inspired when a chronic drought left innumerable swimming pools empty. It was in these empty pools that the Z-Boys skated (illegally) and devised unheard of manoeuvres, revolutionising the sport. When &#8220;Skateboarder&#8221; magazine chronicled their audacious adventures, fame and notoriety beckoned. Whilst competing in the revived National Skateboarder Championships, the tricks performed wowed those present and the Z-Boys ruled. This documentary uses extensive stills and footage from the era (some of it quite astounding) and intersperses it with contemporary interviews with the Z-boys, who reminisce about their glory days and the forces that shaped their destiny. MTV style editing, a plenitude of vintage material and a rocking soundtrack (including Ted Nugent, Black Sabbath, Led Zepplin The Stooges and Jimi Hendrix) makes for great viewing.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>1975 and in a slum area of Santa Monica, California, was located a rough neighbourhood know as Dogtown.

Mallee stump. The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling. It always has been. And yeah, always will be.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Because we didn&#8217;t have any social club rooms at the time to store any of our memorabilia, everything was stored at the pub. And as different publicans come and go, some don&#8217;t like the memorabilia that apparently collects dust, and so he decided he&#8217;d clean the place out. And I went past one day and he was heading out to the tip with all of this football memorabilia in the back of his Ute.</p>\n<p>And so I quickly went in and grabbed the lot. And I&#8217;ve still got a fair bit of it, but it&#8217;s all there for the football club, for the future. And it&#8217;s interesting how some people just don&#8217;t value these things that others really think are fairly precious.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I just think, mainly because of where we live, in the middle of the Mallee, it was called the Mallee Footy League, and we end up with a trophy made out of a Mallee stump, you can&#8217;t get much more significant than that.

And one of the first things I had to do was to start reporting local football.

I started off in the reserves, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he had me in the seniors. It&#8217;s the closest I&#8217;ve ever got to senior football, I must admit.

And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back. I said, well, just get me some boots and I&#8217;ll be right.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:04:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

It came over from the Grand Final the year before, which Swifts Creek won. I came here in September ’35 and they’re still celebrating their win against Benambra and apparently Benambra weren’t happy about it. So, I thought next year, first game next year was out at Benambra and it was sort of an evening up job…</p>\n<p>Got to nearly half time an’ developed into a general brawl. I was playing on the wing and I was lucky, my opponent he wasn’t too keen to go in and neither was I, so we looked on. And I thought “By Jesus, they play fair dinkum over ‘ere”. I think there were over ten blokes rubbed out and I think the umpire was alto rubbed out and scrubbed. He happened to be a local bloke here, an’ he’s a great mate of mine but I’d say is the worst umpire I ever seen in my life. He completely lost control of the game altogether. One bloke got rubbed out for life, he was reported for kicking the umpire, somebody kicked the umpire and quite candidly I think he needed kicking meself. And it was in the days of the Depression and there’s a lot of Sustenance workers, Susso’s we used to call ‘em, working on the roads and that’s probably why the standard of football was very good because we had a lot of people came out into the country, poor fellows you know, that were willing to work for their keep an’ their tucker and that sort of thing…an’ they had a big Sustenance worker camp out doing up the Corryong Road and this fellow that got rubbed out for life he was one of them.</p>\n<p>But nowadays Benambra an’ the Creek are quite good mates, we get on very well I think, don’t we?</p>\n<p>Swifts Creek had a little Rover and apparently he had an enemy at Benambra, he was also a Rover and he said, all of a sudden there’s this bloke he’s down, see, an’ he said I was just gunna race in and slip the boot in and some dirty bugger hit me from behind.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:22:00"]}, {"label":

Football Club over three decades and, at 50 years of age, he has no intentions of stopping.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Ray Albert, Bev Albert, Dartmoor Football Club and Tom Greenaway.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p>\n<p>RAY &#8220;SLIPPERY&#8221; ALBERT:  You got to keep the club going, and I just love playing the games there. Just love going out there with the boys and kicking a few goals. That&#8217;s about all it is.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I get called some funny names. You know, great old bastard, and fossil, and things like that. But it doesn&#8217;t worry me. You get a hard time when your lining up for a goal or something. And you like to bloody kick the goal and say, well, there you go, smart-ass. Get that up ya. [LAUGHS]</p>\n<p>Me wife&#8217;s had a few digs at me about giving the game away, but I don&#8217;t think she was real serious about it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>BEV ALBERT:  From the very start, it was football. Football&#8217;s just part of your life. Yeah. I often say he&#8217;d give  up me before he&#8217;d give up sport. [CHUCKLES] I hope not.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;ll keep doing this for as long as he wants to. And I&#8217;m happy with that, I guess.</p>\n<p>[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>RAY &#8220;SLIPPERY&#8221; ALBERT:  I&#8217;m 50, and the youngest blokes playing in the seconds would be about 16, I think. So you just try and teach the young fellows some of the tricks of the trade, I suppose. And go back yourself and just have a go.</p>\n<p>[PLAYER TALKING TO TEAM IN LOCKER ROOM]</p>\n<p>Basically doing the same things I was doing when I was 15 or 16. Just try and get in front and lead hard and try and get the ball. And you know, I can&#8217;t kick any further than 40 meters. I never could. And start in the 10-yard square, and soon as you see an opening, just go. And if they deliberately hit you on the chest, well and good. You&#8217;ll get it for yourself.</p>\n<p>BEV ALBERT: I have nagged at times. But my main worry is injury. I worry that he might have an injury that&#8217;s not going to get better. That&#8217;s my basic concern, really. It&#8217;s the only reason why I&#8217;d like him to stop. But still, he wants to keep going, so if that makes him happy, it makes me happy.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s getting the side out on the ground and just enjoying the game the footy. Helping one another out. That&#8217;s most of it, I think.</p>\n<p>And there&#8217;s a few blokes playing in the seconds that say, well, Slippery&#8217;s still playing?

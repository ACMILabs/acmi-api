Beguiled by the luxuries that pepper Victor&#8217;s world, Mary becomes flirtatious and develops a taste for decadent habits. Financially ruined and personally demoralised, Victor despairs at Mary&#8217;s transformation. This mournful, melancholy melodrama, and morality play, examines the notions of class and corrupting influence of money on character. &#8220;The 1102nd ruse&#8221; An elderly husband believes himself inured to the skilful wiles of women, to the frustration of his scheming wife. But she is determined to hoodwink him by inventing a cunning ruse unfamiliar to him. A slight comedy of manners that comments on the power of sexuality whilst gently mocking the sanctity of marriage. &#8220;Daydreams&#8221; A man, mourning the death of his wife, is soon romancing an actress who shares a likeness with his deceased beloved. As his obsession grows, he fears insanity and is beset by ghostly apparitions.

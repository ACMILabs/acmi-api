She becomes disillusioned with the school&#8217;s master, who is actually inferior to his highly skilled assistant instructor. Yet this must be concealed at all costs as the master cannot abide losing face in front of his students.</p>\n<p>Cathy leaves the school in her pursuit of a true Kung Fu master, finding one in the most unlikely of places. Stumbling into a movie set, she meets a rough and uncouth martial artist, who refuses to play according to the script and lose the final battle of the film. &#8220;Why should someone of superior skill forfeit to those less deserving of success?&#8221; he thinks. To Cathy, this man Zhu Zhongfa is the complete opposite to the master of the international academy and despite their differences, being poor and on the run from the authorities, they manage to train together in the ancient arts. Everything is shared between them, and they live the fabled life of the Heroes of the Water Margin. They even sleep top-and-tails in a single bed.</p>\n<p>However, eventually we discover that the master of the academy and the immigration police and movie director have teamed up in order to shanghai our two hero. However a strange turn of events leads to the complete opposite happening; with everyone being able to make a compromise and Zhu and Cathy finally being able to star in their very own Kung Fu films. The moral stated at the end of the film is that all masters have good points and bad points, and we should try to learn the best parts of all of them.<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald; June 8, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Description and travel", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teacher-student relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 835460, "name": "Pearl River Film Studio", "creator_id": 22356, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 835461, "name": "Wang Wei", "creator_id": 82322, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 835462, "name": "Zhang Rongren", "creator_id": 82323, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 835463, "name": "Kong Liang", "creator_id": 82324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835464, "name": "Zhou Jianhui", "creator_id": 82325, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835465, "name": "Wang Xuan", "creator_id": 82326, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835466, "name": "Valerie Mennesson", "creator_id": 82327, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835467, "name": "Lv Yongquan", "creator_id": 82328, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835468, "name": "Han Haihua", "creator_id": 82329, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 835469, "name": "Di Yunkui", "creator_id": 82330, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

The basic thrust of the plot is the gradual development of a rapport and sympathy with Reid, in inverse ratio to the loss of respect for York. The film received an X rating on its release due to a controversial five-minute lesbian love scene. Director Robert Aldrich achieved the look and feel of a &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221; picture, although most of it was shot near downtown LA.

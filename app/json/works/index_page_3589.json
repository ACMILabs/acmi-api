The subtlest of his films, &#8220;Cookie&#8217;s Fortune&#8221; focuses on a small American town to juxtapose the &#8216;old racist South&#8217; with the &#8216;new South&#8217; in which interracial relationships and carefree attitudes have replaced the repression and stoicism of the past. Though there is a hint of narrative suspense, &#8220;Cookie&#8217;s Fortune&#8221; proceeds with a higher purpose: taking a relaxed, meandering pace to trace out the moral dimensions of its milieu, and the potential for art to encourage pretension and superficiality while affirming that the joy of life is offered to those who embrace it by way of being earthly, honest, good-natured and spirited. Cast includes Glenn Close, Charles S Dutton, Chris O&#8217;Donnell, Liv Tyler, Julianne Moore, Patricia Neal, Ned Beatty, Lyle Lovett.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960769, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960768, "name": "Etchie Stroh", "creator_id": 79856, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960767, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960766, "name": "Kudzu Productions", "creator_id": 34131, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 960765, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19627, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ZCLVOfEyGowLWsgOF4vn6vjRsJ.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Cookie's fortune (Robert Altman) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49984", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [31998]}, {"id": 118321, "acmi_id": "B2003178", "title": "Cookery Nook [advertisement]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "cookery-nook-advertisement", "creator_credit": "Australian Dried Fruits Association and Australian Sound Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1931", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B2003178_CookeryNook.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1931-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A surreal slice of life from the 1930s, this advertisement was possibly the second sound cartoon ever made in Australia (an advertisement for Shell Oil, Percy Perplexed, being the first).

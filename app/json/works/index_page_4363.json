keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke.</p>\n<p>This film, titled &#8216;Echuca&#8217;, captures a visit to the township of Echuca on the Murray River in Victoria as well as travels along the river itself. Wallace focuses on travelling the river and also on the historic buildings in Echuca itself.</p>\n<p>Originally made using Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 titles &#8216;WHC Presents&#8217; and &#8216;Ehuca&#8217;<br />\n00:00:20:00 paddle steamer travelling on the Murray River.<br />\n00:01:26:00 to 00:02:50:00 historic public buildings and houses around Echuca township<br />\n00:01:53:00 historic &#8216;Log Buggy&#8217; in Echuca which holds a felled log from the nearby Moira Forest<br />\n00:03:04:00 steam rollers in Echuca<br />\n00:04:22:00 Echuca-Moama Bridge over the Murray River<br />\n00:05:02:00 motor traffic and streets in Echuca<br />\n00:05:04:00 St Mary&#8217;s Catholic Church in Echuca<br />\n00:05:39:00 Paddle Steamer Adelaide, berthed as an exhibit in the Hopwood Gardens in Echuca, in the 1960s<br />\n00:07:58:00 passengers on a paddle steamer on the river<br />\n00:08:55:00 water skiing on the river<br />\n00:09:03:00 &#8216;Weir &amp; Lock No 26&#8217; at Torrumbarry<br />\n00:10:07:00 logging and sawmill on the riverbank<br />\n00:12:35:00 open fire barbeque and picnic on the riverbank<br />\n00:13:59:00 examples of fungi along the river<br />\n00:14:50:00 group gathering with guitarist at dusk</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:15:21:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cities and towns - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Echuca (Vic)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Holidays", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Murray River (N.S.W.-S.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’.

The Games&#8221; explores the role journalism and advertising had in encapsulating the Australian spirit in preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the response of the international media. &#8220;The Brand&#8221; looks at identities like Paul Hogan and cultural icons (the koala, Sydney Opera House and Uluru/Ayers Rock) and how they&#8217;re used to establish the brand &#8220;Australia&#8221;. In &#8220;Tourist town&#8221; the cultural and environmental impact of tourism is highlighted. Focusing on Cairns as a destination, we see how the tourist dollar has driven ecological change that sits at odds with the development of local culture and community. &#8220;The Red heart&#8221; focuses on the importance of the &#8216;outback in promoting the country and how Aboriginal culture has been used to sell Australia as a &#8216;spiritual&#8217; destination. &#8220;Selling Australia&#8221; raises questions about the distance between the mythologised image and reality of a place and culture.

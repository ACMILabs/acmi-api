Based on the book of the same name by Niki Daly. Suitable for children aged 4-8.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Set in South Africa, this is a simple story of mutual love between a child and his grandmother. The young boy, Shepard (Songololo to his grandmother), who likes to do things slowly, is enlisted by his grandmother Gogo to assist her on a shopping trip to the city. She is an old woman, not quite in step with modern technology, no longer moving quickly. Love, respect and humour flow between the two. The boy&#8217;s hand-me-down sneakers are worn out and although he doesn&#8217;t ask for them, Songololo&#8217;s desire for a new pair is evident by his dreamy-eyed window-shopping. Gogo, after observing his behaviour and the condition of his sneakers, makes this day very special by buying him a bright red pair. He is so happy she must call out, &#8220;not so fast Songololo&#8221;, to persuade him not to race all the way home; she would walk faster, she jokes, if she had new shoes as well. Niki Daly&#8217;s watercolour and marker illustrations are vibrant, bright and sure, capturing well the humourous, elderly, weather-worn face of Gogo and Songololo&#8217;s youthful, eager expressiveness. Based on the book of the same name by Niki Daly.

Van, an adolescent who lives with his remote father and dominated stepmother, is concerned for his grandmother who languishes in a shoddy elderly home. Despite Van&#8217;s protestations, his father neither visits nor cares causing Van to take action with the assistance of a woman, Aline, who visits her ailing mother in the next bed.

The film focuses on Eve, a college student, attractive and full of life but mysteriously single. Flash-backs follow and show why. Eve&#8217;s failure, according to this film is due to the fact that her choices never match up to her criteria: &#8220;Is he right for me?&#8221; But with the help of her friend Mary, she learns that: &#8220;You can&#8217;t make over a man like you do a room.&#8221; But she still ends up without a boyfriend. Unintentionally hilarious.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Ephemeral films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Self", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Self", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Attitude (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Change (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Commitment (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental hygiene", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental hygiene - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Psychology", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 849488, "name": "Willard Van Dyke", "creator_id": 13367, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849487, "name": "Irving Jacoby", "creator_id": 13185, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849486, "name": "McGraw-Hill Films", "creator_id": 10311, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21690", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1950", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1950"}], "labels": [5578]}, {"id": 73324, "acmi_id": "010381", "title": "Choosing a theme and matching a style: 'The Gallery'", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "choosing-a-theme-and-matching-a-style-the-gallery", "creator_credit": "Philip Law, Gil Brealey and Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1972", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Outlines how Gil Brealey and Philip Law arrived at their ideas and approach for the making of the film &#8220;The Gallery&#8221;, about the National Gallery of Victoria.

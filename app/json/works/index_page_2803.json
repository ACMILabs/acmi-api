Jose Luis is a young executive working in an underwear factory, run by his overbearing mother and passive father. Luis is having a relationship with a factory girl Silvia (Cruz) who is pregnant with his child. Jose&#8217;s mother Conchita, is horrified by the thought of her son marrying anyone at all, let alone a factory worker whose mother is a prostitute. Conchita sets about scuttling her son&#8217;s plans by hiring Raul, a handsome would be bullfighter to woo Silvia. Complications ensue all round as Conchita takes a liking to Raul herself and Jose cannot pass up his fondness for sleeping with Silvia&#8217;s mother (who also has a past history with Jose&#8217;s father). &#8220;Jamon jamon&#8221; is a film about sex, love, infidelity, passion, loyalty and family.

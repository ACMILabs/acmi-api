do have vivid memories of the 1959 Grand Final. I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened.

I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened. But it has never dimmed my passion for Hamilton Footy Club, and I follow their fortunes with great interest.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label":

You do this by collecting the magic item in each room, then escape through a mystical door. There are 12 items to collect, ranging from a broom in room 1 to a cauldron in room 12. When all the items are collected, you must confront the witch in the 13th room. The witch is protected by a magical barrier, so you must collect a padlock and a key (in any order) so that her defence is broken down… Once exposed, you may zap the witch with your trusty garlic-blaster laser gun, (which has 13 shots). 3 additional shots may be obtained by grabbing the bonus garlic. To make your task difficult, the witch has summoned up various ghosts and ghouls, as well as the dreaded dropjaws and zombie hands to destroy you! Don’t forget there’s a time limit. It can be extended by the magic hourglass that appears when time is low.’</p>\n<p>Source: Play It Again website:<br />\nhttp://www.ourdigitalheritage.org/archive/playitagain/games/halloween-harry/</p>\n<p>Last accessed: 11/05/2021</p>\n<p>Original game developed by John Passfield.

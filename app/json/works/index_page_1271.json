Years of writing bestselling romantic fiction under the pseudonym Amanda Gris have started to take their toll on Leo, who yearns to express herself through a blacker style of writing. Bound by her contract, and immersed in denial over the disintegration of her marriage to Paco, she spirals dangerously toward a total breakdown. Her only salvation appears in the form of Angel, who offers her a job as a critic for a national arts supplement. Leo&#8217;s first assignment - to write a critique of her alter ego, Amanda Gris - sets in motion a chain of events which force her to face reality, and sever ties with the fears of the past.

Blondie kidnaps the rich Carolyn (Miranda Richardson), hoping that Carolyn&#8217;s politician husband will help save the unlucky Johnny. But it is election eve and in a city dominated by warring prohibition-era gangster tribes, Blondie finds that her needs are never a priority. Though Altman seamlessly weaves elements of noir, screwball comedy and the crime genre, it is his love of jazz music that informs this film. He organised some of the world&#8217;s leading contemporary jazz musicians to inhabit such roles as Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins (and young actor Albert J.

Shreck inadvertently creates another problem for the caped crusader after his browbeaten secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) mysteriously metamorphoses into Catwoman after a bad day at the office. Batman suddenly finds he has his hands full trying to expose the corrupt workings of the Penguin&#8217;s rise to prominence while fighting his attraction to the felonious feline whom is determined to kill him. Set amidst a world of fairground freaks and the surreal, noirish space of Gotham City, this film explores the duality of human nature and the fine line that separates the heroes from the villains.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Literature&nbsp;→ Comic strip characters in motion pictures", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/batman-2", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2108635, "name": "Tim Burton", "creator_id": 2889, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q56008", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2108634, "name": "Denise Di Novi", "creator_id": 2892, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2053826", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2108633, "name": "Tim Burton", "creator_id": 2889, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q56008", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2108632, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2108631, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47722", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [29970], "external_references": []}]}

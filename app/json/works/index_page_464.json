Filmmaker Celeste Geer takes as her starting point a box of long forgotten 16mm amateur film shot by her late grandfather Mick in the 1940s and 1950s, in an attempt to better understand the character of the man she idolised as a child. She found that the memories captured in the footage of his family, friends and travels and the those that emerged through the recollections of family members and an old mate, offered up contradictory images of her grandfather which challenged the mythology around him built up in her family history. A film that questions the way family memories get tailored for the consumption of future generations.

A further summit was held in April 1993 at the World Trade Centre near Johannesburg and finally it was agreed that the new Government would be formed on a power-sharing basis for five years, ie the National Party and the ANC and that the Cabinet, with its majority, freely able to make decisions without interference or vetoing from the minority National Party.

Geoffrey Fletcher, Kathleen Cox and Ashley Oobagooma talk about their background, their family and their passion for music as they each prepare for the journey to Derby and the Festival. The film concludes with performances by each of these three musicians at the Festival along with footage of the Benning Brothers, Fitzroy Express, Pigram Brothers, Gulingi Nunga, Kevin Gunn and Lucy Cox on stage. Beautifully photographed, particularly of the Australian landscape, and interesting and entertaining interviews along with some great country music.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Unknown"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Documentary", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1863860, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863859, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863858, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1863857, "name": "Lucinda Gamble", "creator_id": 9050, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2305", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [53617]}, {"id": 114123, "acmi_id": "B1005121", "title": "Global insights 4", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "global-insights-4", "creator_credit": "SKA TV, Tom McKendrick, Campbell Manderson and Ntennis Davi", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Global Insights 4 is a compilation of short video works of a subversive political nature, sourced from videoactivists, cultural saboteurs and &#8216;serious&#8217; documentary-makers from around the world.<br />\nPieces featured include an alternative US response to the incidents of September 11 2001, made by Indymedia NYC soon after the event; scenes from the front line of the democracy struggle in Malaysia.

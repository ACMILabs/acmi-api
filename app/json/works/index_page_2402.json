Despite professing his innocence and a lack of police evidence as well as motive, Carter is given 3 consecutive life sentences in prison. What was very clear to some was that this was a case based on racism and revenge, resting in the mind of a disturbed police officer who had it in for Rubin since he was 11. Having twice had his appeal and right to a re-trial turned down, it is not until Rubin receives a letter from Lesra that his luck and life begins to change. Lesra discovers a copy of &#8220;The Sixteenth round&#8221;, a book written by Rubin, in a second hand book store. Reading the book inspires the youngster, who, along with the help of three friends decides to devote their time and money to getting Rubin a fair trial.

Set in the mythical coastal town of Rimini, &#8220;Amarcord&#8221; is not as much a narrative as a series of vignettes tracing Italian history from the rise of Mussolini (1923) to the collapse of the fascist Black Shirts in 1943. But politics in &#8220;Amarcord&#8221; is always entwined with the lusts, fantasies and desires of Fellini&#8217;s teenage alter-ego. By satirising fascism as a burlesque, Fellini creates some of his most ravishing set-pieces, scenes of colour, magic and movement which encompass the many facets of human expression: spiritual, sexual, familial and political. The anchoring of the satire to the memoir of his early life, including his love and obsession with women and their bodies, makes this one of the director&#8217;s most accessible and joyful works. It might sound paradoxical that a film dealing with the bleak atrocitities of fascism can command the words &#8220;warmth&#8221; and &#8220;joy&#8221; but it is part of Fellini&#8217;s purpose in this film to acknowledge the full range of Italian history, and to juxtapose the horrors of the Mussolini period with the perennial cycles of birth, sex, work and death in rural Italy: &#8220;Armacord&#8221; reminds us that dictators pass but sexuality, family and love are constants. The music score by Nino Rota is one of his finest compositions. The rich colour cinematography is by Giuseppe Rotunno.

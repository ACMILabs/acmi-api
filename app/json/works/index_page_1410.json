Using spatial data over a huge range of scales, the sequence was produced using six different renderers, developed specially to deal with planetary surfaces, atmospheres, stars, individual galaxies and groups of galaxies. Aerial photography was combined with high-resolution and global satellite imagery of the Earth. Planetary imagemaps of the Moon, Mars and Saturn were developed from the Clementine, Viking and Voyager missions. The rings of Saturn were derived from Voyager&#8217;s occultation experiment and Voyager itself is depicted as a 3D model heading up out of the plane of the solar system.

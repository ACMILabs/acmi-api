The baby shares the backyard with other children who play on climbing equipment and engage with the baby.</p>\n<p>We see a toddler dressed in rompers standing inside a playpen. The toddler pushes the playpen along from the inside, walking out onto a verandah. There is some delightful footage of a baby crawling along a garden path and playing in a container of water.</p>\n<p>The film shows children playing and swimming in an above ground backyard swimming pool. They have kickboards and rubber rings which could be bicycle tyres. They take turns somersaulting into the water from the edge of the pool. After finishing swimming, and wrapped in towels, the children eat drum-stick style ice creams.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of family at-home recreation and play equipment, including climbing equipment and a swimming pool. There are also examples of suburban architecture, children&#8217;s and babies&#8217; fashion, baby paraphernalia such as a playpen, school sports playing fields and turf cricket.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made on 16mm.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:01:25:00 School cricket match with painted Australia Day/Governor Phillip scene behind<br />\n00:03:52:00 Glamorgan score board<br />\n00:05:21:00 School boys playing cricket, umpire (teacher) and painted wall behind<br />\n00:06:50:00 Baby with necklace of wooden cotton reels<br />\n00:09:08:00 Toddler inside playpen, walking out onto the verandah<br />\n00:09:28:00 Toddler crawls across the verandah<br />\n00:10:51:00 Toddler in rompers crawling along a garden path to play in container of water<br />\n00:14:01:00 Children playing in backyard pool</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:17:51:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2374645, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178646", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963-1964", "notes": "", "to_year": "1963-1964"}], "labels": [59215]}]}

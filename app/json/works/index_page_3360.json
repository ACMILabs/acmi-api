He finally moves on to Copernicus&#8217; theory of a heliocentric Universe setting the scene for the Copernican revolution.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:20:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Creationism", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Astronomers", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Astronomy - History", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Copernicus, Nicolo 1473-1543", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Cosmology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Creation", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Motion", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Orbits", "People&nbsp;→ Copernicus, Nicolo 1473-1543", "People&nbsp;→ Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1814966, "name": "David Jackson", "creator_id": 13558, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126866", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 876938, "name": "BBC-TV", "creator_id": 11912, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47598", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [29861]}, {"id": 89420, "acmi_id": "312212", "title": "The Heart of England", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-heart-of-england", "creator_credit": "Michael Clarke, Edgar H.

This program shows how the theory of probability is used to describe patterns in random events. We are shown how to calculate probabilities and how sampling makes deliberate use of randomness, with larger samples decreasing the variability of results. We are then shown standard deviations, the 68 95 99.7 rule and the central limit theorem.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Management", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Open learning", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematical statistics", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Statistics", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 225048, "name": "COMAP", "creator_id": 24469, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 225049, "name": "Chedd-Angier Productions", "creator_id": 23871, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39368", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [22935]}, {"id": 83444, "acmi_id": "304681", "title": "For all practical purposes.

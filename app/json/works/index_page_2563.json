The centre of artistic innovation has shifted to Florence and to the Duchy of Burgundy. The most important signs of a change of direction in art occur in sculpture, with Claus Sluter in Dijon and Donatello in Florence. Major works featured in this episode include: Giotto&#8217;s frescos for the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, the mausoleum for Cardinal de la Grange, Donatello&#8217;s statue of St Georges and Sluter&#8217;s Well of Moses.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Roland Darbois ; writers, Roger Stephane, Roland Darbois, photography, Roland Dantigny.<br />\nCast: Narrated by Georges Duby.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 891321, "name": "Roland Darbois", "creator_id": 83313, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120301672", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "147150", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [55910]}, {"id": 112627, "acmi_id": "B1006047", "title": "Vern's update", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "verns-update", "creator_credit": "Martin Murphy and Paul Livingston", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Alien abductee and conspiracy theorist Vernon Chatfield broadcasts his latest theory from his bedsit.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Vern&#8217;s update</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Martin Murphy and Paul Livingston</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>2002</p>", "description": "<p>Alien abductee and conspiracy theorist Vernon Chatfield broadcasts his latest theory from his bedsit.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Alien abductee and conspiracy theorist Vernon Chatfield broadcasts his latest theory from his bedsit.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1391313, "name": "Martin Murphy", "creator_id": 7092, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q113586169", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1391312, "name": "Paul Livingston", "creator_id": 9256, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2671", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [52121]}, {"id": 74318, "acmi_id": "011476", "title": "Verdict at 1.32", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "verdict-at-132", "creator_credit": "Charles Davis, Burt Martin and International Temperance Society", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Dramatically depicts the effects of alcohol, stressing that consuming even the smallest quantities of alcohol can be dangerous.

Brett&#8217;s presence creates a constant sense of tension as everybody in the house – his mother Sandra (Lynette Curran), his two brothers Glenn (John Polson) and Steve (Anthony Hayes), his girlfriend Michelle (a fantastic performance from Toni Collete), Glenn&#8217;s wife Jackie (Jeanette Cronin), Steve&#8217;s pregnant girlfriend Nola (Anna Lise) and Sandra&#8217;s boyfriend George (Pete Smith) – treads carefully around Brett&#8217;s restrained anger. The film occasionally flashes forward to the arrest and trial of the three brothers, building up the suspense as we wait for Brett to explode into violence. </p>\n<p>The actual murder is never shown but the suspense of the film and the atmosphere created by a superb cast makes this a chilling experience. The film won four awards at the 1998 AFI Awards – Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay Adapted from Another Source. </p>\n<p>Cinematography by Tristan Milani.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners' families", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 72}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-boys-1998", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 906578, "name": "Arenafilm", "creator_id": 64646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906579, "name": "Australian Film Commission", "creator_id": 66813, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906580, "name": "Premium Movie Partnership", "creator_id": 29258, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906581, "name": "SBS Independant", "creator_id": 78461, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906582, "name": "Robert Connolly", "creator_id": 64647, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906583, "name": "John Maynard", "creator_id": 51466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906584, "name": "Rowan Woods", "creator_id": 11198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 906577, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43702", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26761], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65578, "acmi_id": "001421", "title": "The Boyhood of Thomas Edison", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-boyhood-of-thomas-edison", "creator_credit": "Coronet Instructional Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1964", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Dramatised incidents from the boyhood of Edison - his sitting on eggs to hatch them, his early experiments with chemicals and electricity, the newspaper he published on a train, provide an insight into his character traits.

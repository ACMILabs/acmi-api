Dedicated to the jazz giants, Bud Powell and Lester Young, the film features real-life jazz veteran, the gravel-voiced Dexter Gordon. It dramatises the friendship between an aging jazz saxophonist (Gordon) and a passionate young French admirer who is ready to make personal sacrifices to help his idol. Set to Herbie Hancock&#8217;s superb Academy Award-winning score, &#8220;Round Midnight&#8221; is an elegant, evocative ode to the free-spirited but technically demanding jazz music which blossomed in post-war Paris.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/round-midnight", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2254926, "name": "Bertrand Tavernier", "creator_id": 70368, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q337226", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2254925, "name": "Irwin Winkler", "creator_id": 57099, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q950428", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2254921, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2254918, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39228", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [22798], "external_references": []}, {"id": 72355, "acmi_id": "009277", "title": "Roughnecks: the story of oil drillers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "roughnecks-the-story-of-oil-drillers", "creator_credit": "Guy L.

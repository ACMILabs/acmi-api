Highlights of the reel include the 1940s style of wedding and the wedding fashions of the era. Scenes at the wedding reception show some of the customs of day such as drinking an obligatory glass of sherry (usually upon arrival) and hosting the reception in the family home.

Kenneth sets up a beginning sequence where we see Bettye and Bob and Mrs Rankine gazing at above at the sky looking (as we realise) for the stork to deliver the baby.</p>\n<p>00:07:30:00 Kenneth Robert has arrived and there are lots of shots of him as a very happy baby in the sunny family garden.</p>\n<p>00:08:04:00 Kenneth devises some scenes where Bob Wootton is polishing a car that suddenly turns in to a larger car that he then shows off to Mrs Rankine and Bettye. Cars feature in Kenneth&#8217;s films including a scene here where he and Bob reverse the wide cars down the narrow driveway which was typical of the house style at the time.</p>\n<p>00:12:18:00 a title for the baby at one year old showing height, chest, weight and number of teeth. We immediately see footage of what is likely to be the baby christening at what appears to be a country church.</p>\n<p>00:13:15:00 showing us the baby now crawling on a rug in the family garden.</p>\n<p>00:14:28:00 the baby is sitting playing with a ‘Kool Mints’ tin, playing with water, clapping with his mother and being tickled; the baby being fed what appears to be sugar on a plastic spoon gripped in his teeth to cover his nose, sitting on his stroller and learning to walk between his parents;</p>\n<p>00:17:10:00 the baby walks independently and soon after is tottering around the garden.</p>\n<p>00:17:46:00 with another flower to separate scenes, we see the baby sliding around the garden on a spade being held by his father, running with a pull-along toy, riding around on a broom; playing with a balloon that bursts, looking quite confident with the camera, playing with a spinning top.</p>\n<p>00:19:37:00 title card for the baby at two which includes height and weight followed by a brief shot of the toddler ending with a final flower.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:54:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Weddings", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Automobiles - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2360642, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) are cast as duty bound warriors whose unspoken love for each other spans decades. By comparison, their young romantic counterparts Jen Yu (a promising young warrior) and Lo (her bandit lover) represent freedom, youth and unrestrained love. After Li surrenders his legendary sword to Yu and vows to stop fighting, his plans to retire are halted when the sword is stolen. In their quest to recover it, Li and Yu confront the evil forces headed by Jade Fox who is attempting to recruit the impressionable young Jen Yu to her cause. As the opposing forces of good and evil battle to secure the sword, they also struggle to lure Jen Lu to their side. Based on an early 20th century novel by Wang Du Lu, the project was scripted by Wang Hui Ling, James Schamus and Tsai Kuo Jung. Photographed by Peter Pau. Martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo-Ping.

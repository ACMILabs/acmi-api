Indeed Hoffman&#8217;s was the birthplace of the Brickmaker&#8217;s Union in Victoria. In this film, director Grant Hobson covers the final week of operation of this historic site, in December 1993. He interviews the union representatives and the close family of workers, some of whom he is able to reunite in May 2010 on the site. It is a nostalgic reflection on the heyday and demise of brickmaking in Victoria, as well as capturing the colourful personalities that illustrate the post-war migrant experience in relation to work and settling in Melbourne.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:40:49:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Bricks", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Brickworks", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industrial organization", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industrial sites", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industries - Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industry - History", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industry - Social aspects", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Emigration and immigration - Psychological aspects", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Emigration and immigration - Psychological aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Trade-unions - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Trade-unions - History", "History&nbsp;→ Industry - History", "History&nbsp;→ Trade-unions - History", "People&nbsp;→ Immigrants", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2106000, "name": "Grant Hobson", "creator_id": 83882, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "155466", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2010", "notes": "Footage filmed in December 16, 1993 and May 23, 2010", "to_year": "2010"}], "labels": [56691]}, {"id": 73319, "acmi_id": "010375", "title": "Struggle", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "struggle", "creator_credit": "Peter Baroutis, Dale Butler, Keith Morris and Eureka Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>In an effort to salvage some land for recreational and park use in 1971, the residents of North Carlton, an inner suburb of Melbourne, came into opposition with the building contractor representing Kimberley-Clark Australia Pty Ltd.

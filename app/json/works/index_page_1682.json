Cast includes Matthew Ferguson, Michael Achtman, Damon D&#8217;Oliveira.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Canada - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Censorship", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politicians - Canada", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Canada", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962520, "name": "Grey Zone", "creator_id": 35296, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962521, "name": "John Greyson", "creator_id": 29154, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51096", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33028], "external_references": [{"id": 3259, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7882960"}, {"id": 6520, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "260937"}]}]}

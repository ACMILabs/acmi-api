With a script boasting real life stunt drivers who also happen to be associates of Halicki, this film features a 40 minute Mustang car chase sequence where it is reported that over 93 cars were destroyed. The film received mixed reviews, however it also received a cult following from those amongst the community who like mustangs, car chases, the seventies and a stunt co-ordinator let loose with a film camera.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Automobiles", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Automobile theft", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/gone-in-60-seconds", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993809, "name": "H.B.

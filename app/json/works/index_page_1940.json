At the level of film genre, the most notable change was the rapid decline of one of Occupation&#8217;s favored subjects: the fantastic. Stories of ghosts, prophetic dreams, devils and demons, love potions, and the like had greatly appealed to French filmmakers and audiences in the spiritual half-light of the occupied country.

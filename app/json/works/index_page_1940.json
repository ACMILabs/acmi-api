The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film captures Jack’s family and friends enjoying their scrambler motor bikes in muddy conditions at Korweinguboora, near Ballarat, Victoria. There are also visits to Geelong Racecourse and to Melbourne for some rowing races.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:07:00 a member of Jack’s circle on a motorbike<br />\n00:00:25:00 a group likely to be members of the Radio Cabs cooperative that Jack and Marie established in Ballarat<br />\n00:00:28:00 translucent title across the screen, &#8216;Ballarat Harley Club Mud Scrambles at Korweinguboora…&#8217;<br />\n00:00:39:00 riding the muddy track with sidecars<br />\n00:01:00:00 scrambling motorcycle riders<br />\n00:01:17:00 a fall in the mud for a motorcyclist<br />\n00:01:25:00 two stylishly dressed women pose for the camera<br />\n00:01:48:00 horses racing at Geelong Racecourse followed by the camera panning out over the Racecourse attendees from a higher vantage point<br />\n00:02:31:00 two men cycling through a quiet town street<br />\n00:03:01:00 two women and a man posing for the camera in front of the Eureka Stockade Memorial in what appears to be a cold wind<br />\n00:03:14:00 rowing races on a river<br />\n00:03:30:00 strolling through public gardens</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:29:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Taxicab drivers", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motorcycles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Taxicab drivers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Automobiles - History", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Motorcycle racing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Rowing", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2387494, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "9.5mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

parents from England to Australia in 1911.

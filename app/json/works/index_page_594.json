Clinton Markwell and Lockie Eccles at Warrnambool provide some answers.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Clinton Markwell, Robert Eccles, Tom Greenaway, and the Warrnambool and District Football Umpires Association. Archival film reproduced courtesy of Hampden FNL.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>-The idea of having a green shirt is to signify that we&#8217;re a learner umpire and just to give us a fair go, I guess. And just like if you&#8217;re in a car, you see a learner driver, you know to just be patient with them. And just to understand that they are still learning and that it&#8217;s an important part of their career.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>I played one season of, like, under-twelves football. And I&#8217;m a bit of a wimp, so I don&#8217;t, just not cut out for football, so I&#8217;ve decided to come up and umpire. Over four years that I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve just decided that I love it, and I love football, and that&#8217;s why I stayed.</p>\n<p>-When I first walked into the umpire fraternity, the track supervisor at the stage, he firstly said, come on, young fellow, here&#8217;s the ball. Took me over to the point pace, and he said, showed me the basics of hanging on and holding the ball. And he said, now, I want you to bounce this ball up and down at this point pace. It&#8217;s gotta be straight up and down it, and it&#8217;s also got to reach the top of it.</p>\n<p>So for two weeks or so I practiced and I practiced.

that football had on the town.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Daryl Pitman.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>DARYL PITMAN:  I do have vivid memories of the 1959 Grand Final. I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne.

And in those days, it was either a dropkick or a torp. And of course, the high-mark blokes always went crook if you weren&#8217;t kicking a dropkick, because they&#8217;d have a lark making torpedo kicks.</p>\n<p>The blokes who kicked good dropkicks were worth watching, but a lot of us, myself included, weren&#8217;t good dropkicks. And dropkicks were a problem because the ground, the surface changed. And OK, the natural base could always get away. But all the same, every now and again, you&#8217;d go to a different ground. Like you&#8217;d go up to the sandy ground up at Jeparit and even our best fellows would kick a grounder occasionally.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>JACK DUNLOP:  I loved it, actually. We were always doing it, from the time we first went to school. Because the drop punt had never been thought of when I gave it away. So we fancied it as a distance kick, on fine days. You didn&#8217;t do it on a wind day.</p>\n<p>Mainly the biggest thing with dropkicking was timing. If you didn&#8217;t time it, it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. But no, in later years, we had some pretty good big men, good high marks here. And your ambition was to get it as far as you could. They had a fair idea how far you could kick it, and you would kick to a contest. Not like today, where they won&#8217;t kick to a contest at all.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Those days, when they really used it, they all took their marks, went back and had their shots at goal and that. And they&#8217;d take up here but top it behind the head like this. Nobody ever does that these days.</p>\n<p>When you take a mark, you&#8217;ve got the ball. You&#8217;re got to have your ball in your hand ready, because there might be a handball or something. And those sort of things went out in the early &#8216;50s.</p>\n<p>ONLOOKER:  Let fly, Richie!</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER: Well, every coach I had tried to teach me how to kick dropkicks, and I never really mastered dropkicks. I remember playing one day and Jim Gulley was coaching, and I was playing center halfback. And Gulley didn&#8217;t mind me kicking them, because everyone else thought I&#8217;d kick them further than I did. And Gulley would lead up the ground and the center halfback wouldn&#8217;t follow him, because he thought he was getting too close to me. But that&#8217;s as far as I could kick the jolly things.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Nowadays with the drop punt, everyone kicks a drop punt and the balls so easy to handle. It doesn&#8217;t matter which leg you&#8217;re kicking. You&#8217;ve still got the ball in the same position to kick it. And it&#8217;s made a lot of difference to football, the drop punt, has. It&#8217;s one of the biggest challenges in the whole lot, I&#8217;d say.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Drop kick eulogy</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Malcolm McKinnon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>VIC/Australia, 2007</p>", "description": "<p>A couple of Rupanyup stalwarts recount the days when the drop kick was king, before the invention of the more reliable but less skillful &#8216;drop punt&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Bob Baker, Jack Dunlop, Dawn Teasdale and the Rupanyup Football Club.

And one of the first things I had to do was to start reporting local football. So I think I&#8217;d written my first footy report in 1947, so I&#8212; I had to count back, but I think that might be 60 years come next year.</p>\n<p>It never becomes boring because my wife and I go to a different game every week. Shirley gets out of the car in the freezing cold to take action shots of footballers, and I sit in the warmth, taking notes. And up to date, she hasn&#8217;t complained too much. So we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>\n<p>What we try to do is to cover it based on word and pictures and not to leave anybody out, if we can possibly help it. All the details, right down to the best players in the under-13 netballs and whatever.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>SHANE O&#8217;SHEA:  Robin needed a bit of a hand, so he said, do you want to cover a game? I started off in the reserves, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he had me in the seniors. It&#8217;s the closest I&#8217;ve ever got to senior football, I must admit. But it&#8217;s sort of grown from there. I&#8217;m at a game each Saturday, taking photos and just doing a report on that game.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re recording the history of the leagues and associations as it happens.

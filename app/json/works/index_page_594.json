of Arthur Cherry of Leitchville, a goal umpire always accompanied by his faithful retriever.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Heather Cherry, Diana Mitchell-Dorrity and the Cohuna Historical Centre, and Tom Greenaway.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>Arthur was interested in footy all his life and decided to take up Goal Umpiring. Enjoyed, I think, getting yelled at and all that stuff.</p>\n<p>We acquired this little pup, a little brown curly retriever, which is a breed of dog mainly used for duck shooting and all that sort of stuff. An’ they’re renowned for carrying things in their mouth and that’s their biggest ambition to carry things around, and ah, she started to go to the football with Arthur and she decided she’d become a working member too, and um, she used to… because we lived quite close to the football ground she knew when there was football on and she was always very excited until he made a move and um, she would carry the flags over too the ground an’ when the captains and what-have-you went out to the centre to throw the coin up she would go, as soon as the coin had been thrown and the winning Captain pointed she would just automatically pick up the flags and race down to that end.</p>\n<p>She got tripped over a few times but she would generally just sit in front of the car and just wait and wait and wait and then at half time she would head off and they’d both go and have a drink some where and she’d repeat the project and just carry the flags back to the other end that’s about there was to it, but she was very keen on that little job. But she became, like, quite an icon, everyone knew her. She died and so that was the end of her.</p>\n<p>She is buried in the football ground, or under a pine tree in the football ground, not in the middle of the ground, but she is buried under a pine tree. You don’t really see much of dogs doing the right thing at the football, they’re usually knocking off pies or doing something else or chasing footballers, annoying them.

umpired over 500 games in central Victoria without ever making a report, preferring to administer justice in his own way.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Leon Holt and Ian Jackson. Archival video reproduced courtesy of Hampden FNL, Swifts Creek FC and Dawn Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT:  I got to meet Fizz through junior football. Fizz used to cart me around everywhere and play footy. And then one thing led to another and I developed into seniors, and Fizz was a senior umpire in the North Central League. And so Fizz umpired quite a few games when I was a young fellow playing.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t actually get to see Fizz play. But if you listen to the storytellers around Wedderburn, they say Fizz didn&#8217;t mind dishing a little bit out, being a rover and being small, got that small man syndrome.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  Yeah, I was a very fiery player. I was very tough and very fiery. But when I give it up, I thought, I went back and I just changed the attitude all over. And I thought, well, I&#8217;ve got to be a lot different from what I was as a player.</p>\n<p>I started in 1974, 28 years of umpiring. I umpired 560 games, and I&#8217;ve done at least 20 Grand Finals.</p>\n<p>[MAN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done all those games without any reports. I&#8217;ve sent people off and I&#8217;ve warned people. I&#8217;d rather give them a 50-meter or talk to them than things like that. Because I thought that was a lot easier. Because well, I got more respect by doing that than reporting. That&#8217;s the way I looked at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT: Fizz was always on the side of the bloke that hit second, because he thought the bloke that hit second had a reason to hit. So the bloke that hit first was always in trouble with Fizz. Never be the instigator, but it was OK to be the retaliater.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>Fizz was one of the very first of the idea of just get the play going, you know? If there was biffo or something happening, Fizz wasn&#8217;t going to run in and try and be authoritarian. He&#8217;d just throw the ball up, or bounce the ball, and just get on with it, you know? And if there was 10 blokes belting the heebie-jeebies out of each other down the road, well, eventually they&#8217;d stop, because the footy&#8217;d come into their area.

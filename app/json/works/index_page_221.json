I was very tough and very fiery. But when I give it up, I thought, I went back and I just changed the attitude all over. And I thought, well, I&#8217;ve got to be a lot different from what I was as a player.</p>\n<p>I started in 1974, 28 years of umpiring.

I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team. We all got our photo taken in front of the team before the game, in front of a huge crowd.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>It was a huge event in the town, and I think everything else stopped. I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters. And it was a friendly rivalry, but by gee, it was fair dinkum. And when we played each other, whichever team won, well, the other family was in for a rough time for the next nine weeks until they met again.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I sort of didn&#8217;t have much choice other than to be passionate about local football, given my family&#8217;s history. One of my very, very favorite photographs is of the 1912 North Hamilton Football Club. My grandfather was the captain of that side, and he&#8217;s holding the footy in that photo.</p>\n<p>But I think there are something like seven or eight Pitmans in it. His father is at the back. That&#8217;s my great-grandfather at the back as a committee man. I think he might have been president. And one of the mascots is in fact my grandfather&#8217;s younger brother.</p>\n<p>But there were quite a few brothers in that side. And they were renowned early in the 1910s, 1920s, and being a champion football family.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I left Hamilton when I was just eight years old, when we came down to Melbourne. I&#8217;ve been here ever since. But still have a passion for Hamilton. Still look up every week to see how they went.</p>\n<p>Would love to have gone back and played football for Hamilton. It was a dream I had as a kid, was just going back and playing one game on the Noble Oval in the black and white like my dad did and like my granddad did. But it never happened.

Archival film by John Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLES BLOWING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER:  I&#8217;d say it was about 1950, I started. And in those days, it was either a dropkick or a torp. And of course, the high-mark blokes always went crook if you weren&#8217;t kicking a dropkick, because they&#8217;d have a lark making torpedo kicks.</p>\n<p>The blokes who kicked good dropkicks were worth watching, but a lot of us, myself included, weren&#8217;t good dropkicks. And dropkicks were a problem because the ground, the surface changed. And OK, the natural base could always get away. But all the same, every now and again, you&#8217;d go to a different ground. Like you&#8217;d go up to the sandy ground up at Jeparit and even our best fellows would kick a grounder occasionally.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>JACK DUNLOP:  I loved it, actually. We were always doing it, from the time we first went to school. Because the drop punt had never been thought of when I gave it away. So we fancied it as a distance kick, on fine days. You didn&#8217;t do it on a wind day.</p>\n<p>Mainly the biggest thing with dropkicking was timing. If you didn&#8217;t time it, it didn&#8217;t go anywhere. But no, in later years, we had some pretty good big men, good high marks here. And your ambition was to get it as far as you could. They had a fair idea how far you could kick it, and you would kick to a contest. Not like today, where they won&#8217;t kick to a contest at all.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Those days, when they really used it, they all took their marks, went back and had their shots at goal and that. And they&#8217;d take up here but top it behind the head like this. Nobody ever does that these days.</p>\n<p>When you take a mark, you&#8217;ve got the ball. You&#8217;re got to have your ball in your hand ready, because there might be a handball or something. And those sort of things went out in the early &#8216;50s.</p>\n<p>ONLOOKER:  Let fly, Richie!</p>\n<p>BOB BAKER: Well, every coach I had tried to teach me how to kick dropkicks, and I never really mastered dropkicks. I remember playing one day and Jim Gulley was coaching, and I was playing center halfback. And Gulley didn&#8217;t mind me kicking them, because everyone else thought I&#8217;d kick them further than I did. And Gulley would lead up the ground and the center halfback wouldn&#8217;t follow him, because he thought he was getting too close to me. But that&#8217;s as far as I could kick the jolly things.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Nowadays with the drop punt, everyone kicks a drop punt and the balls so easy to handle.

Foreign relations began to be fostered and questions began to be quietly asked of the infallibility of Mao until his death in 1976. Archival footage, interviews with members of the Red Guards and those under attack at the time, still photographs, and a thorough commentary combine to provide a detailed look at this period of Chinese history and represent the mood of the country then faced with moving ahead without the cult of Mao.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Rural conditions", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Diplomacy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Foreign relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - Cultural Revolution, 1966-1969", "History&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "History&nbsp;→ Industry - History", "History&nbsp;→ Mao, Tse-tung, 1893-1976", "People&nbsp;→ Mao, Tse-tung, 1893-1976", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996472, "name": "Sue Williams", "creator_id": 79940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996471, "name": "Ambrica Productions", "creator_id": 34377, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996470, "name": "VEA", "creator_id": 21531, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50206", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32200], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92707, "acmi_id": "316024", "title": "Sirens", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sirens", "creator_credit": "John Duigan, Sue Milliken, Sarah Radclyffe Productions-Sirens Limited, WMG Film, Samson Productions and British Screen Finance Limited", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in a small Australian town in the 1920s, &#8220;Sirens&#8221; is a light-hearted comedy written and directed by John Duigan (Flirting, The Year my voice broke).

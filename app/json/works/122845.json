This includes the Yorke Peninsula, and surrounding areas, encompassing the Olympic Dam mine, the Cooper Basin, and the Maralinga / Woomera nuclear test sites. The Olympic Dam mine is the largest single deposit of uranium in the world, and the fourth largest copper deposit; the Cooper Basin has Australia’s most important oil and gas deposits; and the UK conducted seven nuclear tests at Maralinga / Woomera from 1956 to 1963.

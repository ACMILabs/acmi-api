Awaiting Joan is a disastrous Parisian campaign and betrayal by the Dauphin which leads to her being burned at the stake for heresy. She was declared a saint nearly 500 years after her death.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This is a lavishly produced, literal interpretation of the life of the 15th century historical heroine Joan d&#8217;Arc. In a tiny village during the Hundred Years&#8217; War, teenager Joan d&#8217;Arc (Leelee Sobieski) has been raised by her parents Peter (Powers Boothe) and Isabelle (Jacqueline Bisset), amidst the wreckage continually wrought by British incursions into the area. A devout girl, Joan experiences visions of St Catherine, which lead her to believe that she may be the &#8220;Maid of Orleans&#8221;, a mythical figure who will lead France to victory over its enemies. Counseled by her local priest (Robert Loggia), Joan pursues her destiny in spite of her father&#8217;s wishes. At first supported only by lowly commoners, Joan comes to the attention of the Dauphin, King Charles (Neil Patrick Harris). He uses Joan to unite his quarreling factions and his generals, at first sceptical, are won over by Joan&#8217;s startling victories. Awaiting Joan is a disastrous Parisian campaign and betrayal by the Dauphin which leads to her being burned at the stake for heresy. She was declared a saint nearly 500 years after her death.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Hundred years war, 1339-1453", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Saints", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ France - History", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Saints", "People&nbsp;→ Saints", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 800876, "name": "Alliance Atlantis", "creator_id": 30788, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 800877, "name": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 12143, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 800878, "name": "Endemol Entertainment", "creator_id": 30789, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 800879, "name": "Telecino", "creator_id": 30790, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 800880, "name": "Peter Bray", "creator_id": 30791, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 800881, "name": "Christian Duguay", "creator_id": 30792, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 800875, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45766", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [28289]}, {"id": 83755, "acmi_id": "305014", "title": "Joan Lindsay", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "joan-lindsay", "creator_credit": "AAV Australia, Australia Council and Ian McKay", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Videos on Australian Writers: archival writers series II&#8221;.<br />\nIn this interview with John Taylor, Joan Lindsay speaks about her experiences as an art student at the National Gallery School in Melbourne and her decision to become a writer.

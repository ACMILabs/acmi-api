Eschewing conventional plotting by enfusing all the characters with ambiguity and complexity, &#8220;Girlfight&#8221; is a truly inspiring neo-feminist coming of age story. Both the female and male characters in the film are treated sensitively, and with a refreshing disavowal of the usual gender and racial stereotypes accorded to the representation of Hispanic Americans. The film won both the Directing and Grand Jury Prize at the 2000 Sundance Festival and there has also been international acclaim for Rodriguez whose feature film debut it is. The film also features a cameo appearance by independent filmmaker John Sayles who helped finance the film. The featurette accompanying this DVD features in-depth interviews with Kusama and with the actors in the film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "People&nbsp;→ Griffin, Martha"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/girlfight", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996812, "name": "Karyn Kusama", "creator_id": 68392, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q467484", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996811, "name": "Maggie Renzi", "creator_id": 23690, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996810, "name": "Martha Griffin", "creator_id": 80039, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996809, "name": "Sarah Green", "creator_id": 25874, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996808, "name": "Independent Film Channel", "creator_id": 33145, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50415", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32391], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92900, "acmi_id": "316240", "title": "Krull", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "krull-dvd", "creator_credit": "Peter Yates, Ron Silverman and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in the fantastic kingdom of Krull, our plot starts with the revelation that the kingdom is under threat from the indescribable Beast and his army of Slayers.

Jack&#8217;s disinherited relatives resolve to maintain their pride and their position as an upper class family and plot to have Jack committed to a mental institution and leave them as guardians to the Gurney Estate. However, Jack has to produce a family heir before any of this can take place. The lengths the family go to and the unexpected, hilarious and truly bizarre outcomes of their efforts, including Jack beginning to secretly think that he is Jack the Ripper and murdering one of the family members, add up to a most unusual and enjoyable cinematic experience consisting of narrative and vaudeville song-and-dance sequences, mixed in with a good measure of black comedy and contempt for the British class system. Cast also includes Arthur Lowe, Alastair Sim, Coral Browne, Michael Bryant, William Mervyn, Carolyn Seymour.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Parody", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Inheritance and succession", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Inheritance and succession", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Vaudeville"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-ruling-class", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996769, "name": "Peter Medak", "creator_id": 25548, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q724100", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996768, "name": "Jack Hawkins", "creator_id": 80017, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996767, "name": "Jules Buck", "creator_id": 23715, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996766, "name": "Keep Films", "creator_id": 34548, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50364", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [32342], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92851, "acmi_id": "316186", "title": "Play misty for me [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "play-misty-for-me-dvd", "creator_credit": "Clint Eastwood, Robert Daley, Malpaso Company and Universal Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In this contemporary thriller, Clint Eastwood plays the popular California disc jockey, Dave Garland.

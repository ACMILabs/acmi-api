Abel has gone to the States to make money so he can come back and marry Alma.

Their struggles to survive are slowly revealed in a mosaic of small, but detailed incidents which poignantly capture the repetitive drudgery and occasional joys of the exploited peasant class in rural Italy. Following the tradition of Italian neo-realist cinema, Olmi drew on a large ensemble cast of non-professional actors and shot the film on 16mm in a lyrical documentary style. The muted colour and straight-on, eye-level cinematography captures the striking beauty of the Italian countryside through the seasons without diminishing or romanticising the lives of the peasants who work it.

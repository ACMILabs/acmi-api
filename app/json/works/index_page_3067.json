Before looking at complex situations it is best to simplify the problem to get essentials which can then be applied to the more complex situations. This is done by reducing variables, making assumptions and adopting rules. The example used is getting news stories ready for airing within a fixed time-limit. The algorithms demonstrated are: first fit, list processing, first fit decreasing, performance bound and bin packing, of which the heuristic algorithms are quicker but not optimal.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Juggling machines looks at the problems of scheduling.

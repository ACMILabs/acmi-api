Jackson&#8217;s research reveals that McKenzie was responsible for developing many cinematic innovations including colour film, sync sound and tracking shots that had long been attributed to more famous motion picture pioneers. McKenzie also risked his life to make a silent biblical epic &#8216;Salome&#8217; in remote bush on the West Coast of the South Island. As Jackson turns up more amazing facts about the McKenzie legacy, it gradually becomes apparent that his documentary is a meticulously staged hoax. The &#8216;mockumentary&#8217; combines interviews with real people such as actor Sam Neill, film critic Leonard Maltin and Miramax Chairman Harvey Weinstein, with elaborately faked, utterly convincing silent film footage, still photographs and other archival material. Jackson and Botes&#8217; film is a clever, slightly deranged parody of the earnest documentary tributes to the centenary of cinema that were being made at the time. When it first aired on New Zealand television it sparked a minor controversy, enraging viewers who had been duped into believing it was about a real historical subject.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Mockumentary", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - New Zealand", "History&nbsp;→ New Zealand - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - New Zealand"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 913348, "name": "Costa Botes", "creator_id": 33510, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5174827", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913347, "name": "Peter Jackson", "creator_id": 72164, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4465", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1814188, "name": "Sue Rodgers", "creator_id": 34904, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913343, "name": "New Zealand Film Commission", "creator_id": 3023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913344, "name": "New Zealand On Air", "creator_id": 27178, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034572", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913345, "name": "Wingnut Films", "creator_id": 31880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 913342, "name": "New Zealand Film Commission", "creator_id": 3023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50748", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [32711]}]}

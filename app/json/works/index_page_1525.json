They have achieved their goal of creating a schlock splatter horror with a load of laughs but with a sci-fi alien plot twist that makes it stands out. What also stands out is the finish of the film as its low budget is not that evident in the final outcome. Fictional small Australian country town of Berkeley, renowned for its good fishing, is invaded by aliens that send strange meteors from space turning people into the undead - zombies. The local beauty contest winner Rene (Felicity Mason) is about to leave town but is prevented when her driver becomes victim to zombie attack. The local town loony, a tall silent bloke called Marion (Mungo McKay), comes to her aid with a three-barrelled custom-made rifle. Blood, gore, splatter and laughs aplenty ensue as our hapless heroes (including the swearing town cop and his rookie constable, Wayne and his pregnant girlfriend) go about surviving the onslaught of brain sucking zombies. The aliens appear on earth cleansing some folks with healing rain and they are then ascended to orbit the earth. The ending has the potential for a sequel and hopefully someone will give them the money! This is must see cult classic for those into the schlock/horror or low budget independent genre/s. Crew that deserve special mention are the make-up designer Steven Boyle, cinematographer Andrew Strahorn, composer Cliff Bradley and everyone that worked on the special effects, which includes the directors.

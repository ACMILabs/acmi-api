The milieu of feudal society in South India is carefully established as the setting for the playing out of power relations in the liaison between the temporarily abandoned wife of a deaf-mute farmhand and the landlord&#8217;s son sent to manage the farm. For the son, sexual attraction is linked to the woman&#8217;s lack of social status. Yet he is initially restrained by his middle class fear of exposure. From a position of relative anonymity the woman develops a complex response to the son&#8217;s presumption.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Mohan J. Bijlani, Freni M.

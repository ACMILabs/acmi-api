The collection contains Eidlitz&#8217;s experiments with light, movement and technology in film.</p>\n<p>This short film features Frank Eidlitz&#8217;s early experiments with light, colour and motion. Commissioned by the television network National Broadcasting Company (NBC) to reinterpret the station&#8217;s classic peacock logo, Eidlitz produced a series of film experiments with kaleidoscopic spinning lights.</p>\n<p>To create these visuals, Eidlitz covered a series of disks with pieces of reflective paper and fluorescent colours, which he then placed on an apparatus that spun the disks at a high speed. The motion could be varied and stopped at any time, allowing the artist to create varying designs and images.</p>\n<p>Opening with a close-up of a woman&#8217;s face covered in reflected lights, the majority of the film is comprised of flashing lights and spinning colours.

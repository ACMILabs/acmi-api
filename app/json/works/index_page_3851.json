Romantic, melodramatic, evil and mystical, this German folkloric tale set in the Bohemian forest tells of a rivalry between Max (Toni Kramer) and Kaspar (Wolfgang Probst) over the hand of the beautiful young Agathe (Catarina Ligendza), daughter of Kuno (Fritz Linke) the head Ranger to Prince Ottokar. For Max to be worthy of marrying Agathe, he has to win the traditional shooting contest on his wedding morning. Kaspar has already sold his soul to the devil - will Max do the same? Using colorful set designs, costumes and make-up, this stage performance has a Grimm&#8217;s fairytale quality, albeit an adult fairytale. Cast also includes Wolfgang Schone and Raili Viljakainen. Sung in German with no English subtitles. Includes booklet with English translation.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884181, "name": "Hartmut Schottler", "creator_id": 36485, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884180, "name": "Achim Freyer", "creator_id": 36484, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884179, "name": "Osterreichischer Rundfunk-Fernsehen", "creator_id": 15352, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884178, "name": "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen", "creator_id": 20976, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884177, "name": "National Video Corporation", "creator_id": 23494, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 884176, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52407", "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [33983]}]}

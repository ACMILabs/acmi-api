In French with English subtitles.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>After his deeply personal autobiographical debut, &#8220;The 400 Blows&#8221;, Truffaut&#8217;s second feature was a homage to film noir and gangster films. But unlike the strict genre rules of the Hollywood films, &#8220;Shoot the Piano Player&#8221; is as much a celebration of the pleasure and possibilities of cinema as it is a straightforward crime film. Peppered with comic asides, philosophical speculations, and dissertations on love, it is beautifully shot in black and white by Raoul Coutard and features a jazzy score by George Delerue (both cinematographer and composer were to have a longstanding collaboration with Truffaut). Based on a crime novel, &#8220;Down There&#8221; by David Goodis, the film stars Charles Aznavour who is convincingly seedy and attractive as a once famous classical pianist, Edouard Saroyan, who has abandoned fame and his career after the tragic death of his wife. His anonymity is shattered when his brother runs into him one night in a cafe. The brother is being pursued by two thugs who are after the loot Edouard&#8217;s older brothers have run off with after double-crossing the two thugs during a bank robbery.

The road movie that unfolds becomes a series of symbolic tableaux through which Angelopoulos examines a contemporary Europe of ruthless economic and social borders, a Europe in which the divisions of East and West, rich and poor, affect every encounter the children have. In their fate, we can read a long history of post-World War II immigration that is not only about the loss of notions of home, but also about the loss of traditional ties of family, ritual and space. In a sense, &#8220;Landscape in the mist&#8221; is a requiem to the loss of innocence - not only that of the children, but also for Europe itself. Music by Eleni Karaindrou.

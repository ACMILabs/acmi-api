Based on the novel &#8220;That uncertain feeling&#8221; by Kinsley Amis.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Wales", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Librarians", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Lust", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Amateur theater", "Places&nbsp;→ Wales"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1809506, "name": "Leslie Gilliat", "creator_id": 36793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q505853", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965018, "name": "Frank Launder", "creator_id": 24749, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q979175", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965019, "name": "Sidney Gilliat", "creator_id": 24750, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q505853", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965020, "name": "British Lion Films", "creator_id": 17625, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965022, "name": "Sidney Gilliat", "creator_id": 24750, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q505853", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 965017, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53103", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [34548], "external_references": [{"id": 2646, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7094260"}, {"id": 5064, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "54723"}]}, {"id": 85034, "acmi_id": "306395", "title": "Only the Brave", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "only-the-brave", "creator_credit": "Fiona Eagger, Pickpocket Productions and Ana Kokkinos", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Alex (Elena Mandalis) and Vicki (Dora Kaskanis) are two young Greek Australian girls in Melbourne’s western suburbs.

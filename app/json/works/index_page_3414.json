This film takes a savage view of American societal mores, as it mocks small town values, beauty contests, marriage, alcoholism, obesity, anorexia, paedophiles, handicapped people, mother-daughter relationships and the gauche self-consciousness of teenagers. It gladly follows in the footsteps of &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221; and &#8220;Spinal tap&#8221;, but never reaches the hilarity of such predecessors, possibly due to its good natured and loveable heroine, contrasting too starkly with hideous caricatures. At times the black humour and merciless ridiculing of the screenplay are uncomfortable to watch, defiantly crossing over into bad taste on numerous occasions.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Mockumentary", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ambition", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/drop-dead-gorgeous-1999", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962806, "name": "Capella", "creator_id": 35480, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962807, "name": "KC Medien", "creator_id": 35481, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962808, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962809, "name": "Gavin Polone", "creator_id": 68060, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962810, "name": "Judy Hofflund", "creator_id": 79530, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962811, "name": "Michael Patrick Jann", "creator_id": 80395, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3308437", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962805, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51284", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33155], "external_references": [{"id": 1207, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q698492"}, {"id": 4037, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10490"}]}, {"id": 85097, "acmi_id": "306465", "title": "Driving: risks and responsibilities", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "driving-risks-and-responsibilities", "creator_credit": "Safetycare Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Cars have become an essential tool in most businesses and the risks and responsibilities associated with driving on the job are the primary focus of this program.

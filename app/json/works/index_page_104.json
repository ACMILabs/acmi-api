The Druids&#8217; fearful appearance to the Romans is also detailed, along with the stories of Druid rebellion against Roman invasion, let down in the end by lack of organisation against the most disciplined army of the world at that time and resulting in many elements of Druidism being banned or encapsulated in Catholicism.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Celts", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholic Church", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Goddess religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Paganism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religions", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Archaeology", "History&nbsp;→ Celts", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Ireland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Celtic", "History&nbsp;→ Goddess religion", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Paganism", "History&nbsp;→ Religions", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3082656, "name": "Caryl Ebenezer", "creator_id": 80006, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086170", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082658, "name": "J Williams", "creator_id": 80007, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082654, "name": "Comataldh Craolaidh Gaidhlig", "creator_id": 34537, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223393", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082648, "name": "Opus Television", "creator_id": 34535, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159895", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082652, "name": "S4C International", "creator_id": 34536, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271396", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082650, "name": "Sianel 4 Cymru (S4C) (Channel 4 Wales)", "creator_id": 25343, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143646", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 3082646, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115568, "acmi_id": "S01404", "title": "The Celts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-celts", "creator_credit": "Caryl Ebenezer, J Williams, Opus Television and SBS-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93034, "acmi_id": "316394", "title": "A Dead song?

The questions that arise as to how they got to Ireland, the area where the contemporary true Celts remain, are investigated with reference to conflicting theories about coastal migration patterns of the time or the ambiguous archaeological evidence which is featured in the area in order to illustrate some possibilities given the difficulty of tracing Celtic history. A study is also recorded in this program of the population in present day Celtic areas and their heritage through a genetic heritage testing project with local school children and a discussion of their family heritage. While the study is seen to shed an interesting light on tracing Celtic history through genetic means it also confirms and engages with the discussion in the rest of the program of the enigma that the Celts remain.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Celts", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Genetics", "History&nbsp;→ Archaeology", "History&nbsp;→ Celts", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Ireland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Ancient", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Celtic", "History&nbsp;→ Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ Historic sites", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ History, Ancient", "History&nbsp;→ Ireland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Iron age", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Genetics", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 3082628, "name": "Caryl Ebenezer", "creator_id": 80006, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121086170", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082630, "name": "J Williams", "creator_id": 80007, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082626, "name": "Comataldh Craolaidh Gaidhlig", "creator_id": 34537, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223393", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082620, "name": "Opus Television", "creator_id": 34535, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159895", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082624, "name": "S4C International", "creator_id": 34536, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271396", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 3082622, "name": "Sianel 4 Cymru (S4C) (Channel 4 Wales)", "creator_id": 25343, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143646", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 3082618, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115568, "acmi_id": "S01404", "title": "The Celts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-celts", "creator_credit": "Caryl Ebenezer, J Williams, Opus Television and SBS-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93034, "acmi_id": "316394", "title": "A Dead song?

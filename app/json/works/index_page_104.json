This film is as much a parable about human nature as it is a representation of the struggles of the Russian peasantry, using technical experiments similar to those of Georges Melies to embellish the transcendental nature of the subject. Zvenigora is the fourth film by Russian film master Alexander Dovzhenko, who began his career in film in 1926 after working as both a cartoonist and painter. Despite negative critical reaction to Zvenigora, it was the forerunner of his more celebrated films Arsenal (1929), Zemlya (1930), and Ivan (1932), which perpetuated his interest in honouring the lives and struggles of peasants, and served as a tribute to his heritage as a man of the Ukraine.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Soviet Union", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Soviet Union", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 773543, "name": "Oleksandr Petrovych Dovzhenko", "creator_id": 19449, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 773542, "name": "VUFKU", "creator_id": 19447, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36738", "production_places": [{"id": 180, "name": "Soviet Union", "slug": "soviet-union"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1928", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1928"}], "labels": [20391]}, {"id": 84041, "acmi_id": "305328", "title": "Zulu Zion", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "zulu-zion", "creator_credit": "Mischa Scorer, Peter Montagnon and BBC", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1977", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 10 of Series &#8220;The Long Search&#8221;.<br />\nIn this visit to South Africa Ronald Eyre looks at the ways Christianity has evolved into an almost completely different religion, with an emphasis on dreams, purification, healing and the power of the holy spirit.

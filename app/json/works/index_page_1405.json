Sheridan Le Fanu&#8217;s story &#8220;Carmilla&#8221; plays out as a mildly terrifying erotic thriller, produced by Hammer, the classic British production house, at a time when they were tapping into the zeitgeist of the times by presenting excessive nudity within the auspices of the horror genre. At times the film is genuinely spooky, but much of the film is lavishly devoted to displaying milky white bosoms heaving out of trussed up dresses. This film is part of a trilogy of Hammer lesbian/vampire films that incudes &#8220;Lust for a vampire&#8221; (1971) and &#8220;Twins of evil&#8221; (1972).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Irish literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962558, "name": "Hammer Films", "creator_id": 35349, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962559, "name": "American International Pictures (AIP)", "creator_id": 1987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962560, "name": "Harry Fine", "creator_id": 80337, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962561, "name": "Michael Style", "creator_id": 15153, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962562, "name": "Roy Baker", "creator_id": 16925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51122", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [33054], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94305, "acmi_id": "318119", "title": "Vampire hunter D: bloodlust [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "vampire-hunter-d-bloodlust-dvd", "creator_credit": "Urban Vision Entertainment, Film Line International, Mata Yamamoto, Masao Maruyama, Taka Nagasawa and Yoshiaki Kawajiri", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 2001", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this animated horror movie, set in a menacing distant future where the dead haunt the living, a deadly vampire kidnaps a beautiful human woman.

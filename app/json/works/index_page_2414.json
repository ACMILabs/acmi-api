Abel has gone to the States to make money so he can come back and marry Alma.

Robert De Niro plays Leonard Lowe, the first patient awakened by the drug, whose marked improvement prompts the hospital board to expand the benefits to other patients. As patients begin to engage in life again and confront the radical changes in themselves and their world, Dr Sayer deals with the emerging side effects.

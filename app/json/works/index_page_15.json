Harry grows from a boy in uniform to a man in war. We watch as he learns of his impending death and how he faces it. &#8216;Harry&#8217;s War&#8217; is about when mateship transcends race, cultural differences and social barriers. It is a story of how war drives men to the brink and the journey becomes more important than the journey&#8217;s end. Cast includes: David Ngoombujarra, Peter Docker, Glenn Shea, Bob Maza and Christina Saunders.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Producers and directors", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Papua New Guinea", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mateship", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1732883, "name": "Richard Frankland", "creator_id": 7072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1732882, "name": "John Foss", "creator_id": 72852, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1732881, "name": "Richard Frankland", "creator_id": 7072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1732880, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1732879, "name": "Film Victoria", "creator_id": 68720, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1732878, "name": "Australia.

This special edition includes deleted scenes, theatrical trailer and footage of director Andrew Dominik and Eric Bana&#8217;s visit to Chopper in Tasmania while researching the film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Biographical", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prison violence", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1832432, "name": "Andrew Dominik", "creator_id": 34038, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1832431, "name": "Michele Bennett", "creator_id": 32621, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1832430, "name": "Palace Films", "creator_id": 24919, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1832429, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "ISO; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49968", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [31982], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92461, "acmi_id": "315741", "title": "The Sum of us [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-sum-of-us-dvd", "creator_credit": "Geoff Burton, Kevin Dowling, Hal McElroy, Film Finance Corporation Australia and Southern Star Entertainment", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Harry (Jack Thompson) is a widower whose life centres around getting his gay son, Jeff (Russell Crowe), to settle down with a nice man.

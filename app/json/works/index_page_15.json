Marker was a central figure in the French New Wave and was involved in rehabilitating Medvedkin&#8217;s career in the late-1960s. It is then also a personal self-appraisal of the artist&#8217;s own politics and aesthetics, an appraisal which aims to investigate what drew artists to the radicalism of Soviet Bolshevism and the consequences for &#8220;radical art&#8221; now that Communism has been discredited. The film not only explores Medvedkin&#8217;s work but also the cinema of Eisenstein and Dziga-Vertov.

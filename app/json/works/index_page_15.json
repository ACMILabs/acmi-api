Not only are its environments rendered in stunning detail, but it’s designed to keep players interested and engaged. Like a theme park, it has waypoints, landmarks, maps – design features that encourage the player to explore the game and its narrative without feeling lost.<br />\nBy contrast, award-winning game designer, Ian MacLarty describes the vast expanses that exist out of bounds as feeling transgressive, surprising and impermanent – a piece of genuine digital wilderness, where the landscape responds unpredictably to player action. One wrong move could risk the player respawning within the map’s bounds and spending hours trying to break out again.<br />\nThis was the experience MacLarty tried to replicate in Red Desert Render,  a surreal open-world game that encourages curiosity and surprise.

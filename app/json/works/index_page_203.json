Writer and painter Gibran is introduced to Salma, only daughter of Sheikh Fares, a wealthy and influential aristocrat. Salma is a woman of ethereal beauty, a pure and noble soul and she and Gibran fall instantly in love. Their courtship is chaste and lengthy, watched over by Salma&#8217;s aunt as chaperone. A local bishop waylays the couple after convincing Fares that Salma should marry his nephew, Mansour Bey, a man from a reputable family but who is openly pursuing a relationship with another woman and acutely aware of the money he is marrying into. A disheartened Salma enters the loveless marriage, Gibran&#8217;s love increasing by the day. Tragedy ensues when Fares passes away, leaving his son in law to squander the family&#8217;s money and his daughter without protection. Bey is intent on Salma producing an heir. Sentimental and melodramatic, the film has a lyrical quality and strong performances that resonates long after viewing.

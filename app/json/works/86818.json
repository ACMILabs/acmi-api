With the use of many letters, diaries and film we re-experience a war that involved the people of 5 continents.

Episode 4-SLAUGHTER, the battles of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele were three of the worst of the war, yet soldiers sought to keep their sanity with music, sport and theatre.

Episode 6- COLLAPSE, Germany&#8217;s war effort collapsed in 1918. Episode 7-LEGACY, the end of WW1 did little to relieve suffering across Europe. Four empires collapsed and large parts of the continent were devastated.

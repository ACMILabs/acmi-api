"<p>William (Billy) Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film.

"<p>John Robert (Jack) Anderson (1924–1993) was a film distributor, cinema owner and photographer as well as an enthusiastic filmmaker in and around Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film is all about the Anderson and Bourke families at home and out and about. The title cards introduce this film as being photographed by Jack but also directed by Marie Bourke (using her pre-married name). Marie has the family going about their everyday activities, sometimes surprising them with the camera and sometimes directing them to hold a pose. She films the family fishing, dining, cutting flowers and modelling their clothes. The family appear in their workday clothes as well as being dressed in their best.</p>\n<p>This aspect of the film is a reminder of how people dressed in the 1940s to 1950s, when more expensive outfits were kept for outings such as church or shopping or special outings leaving working clothes for the day to day. It is a captivating look at the members of this extended family who obviously enjoyed each other’s company, their hometown of Ballarat and their individual pursuits and as always, there is a little comedy along the way.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:02:00:00 three title cards ‘Pathescope/ Safety film’, ‘Directed by M.

Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film is all about the Anderson and Bourke families at home and out and about. The title cards introduce this film as being photographed by Jack but also directed by Marie Bourke (using her pre-married name).

In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film shows scenes of travelling around the Victorian countryside on motorcycles (motorbikes).</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 9.5mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 motorcycles being filmed from a vehicle travelling alongside<br />\n00:00:20:00 motorcycle rider with passenger wearing a beret<br />\n00:00:40:00 motorcycle riders gather for the camera at the Atlantic Garage in Ballarat<br />\n00:01:17:00 riding the motorcycles down a dusty road</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:01:34:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motorcycles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Roads - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Country life - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Clothing and dress - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1123202, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1139, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/QfVsgZE40II"}], "media_note": null, "images": [], "videos": [{"id": 1218, "title": "B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps.mov", "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/a_B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps.mp4", "web_resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/w_B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps.mp4", "duration_secs": 94.375, "subtitles": null, "master_metadata": {"title": "B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps", "width": 1452, "height": 1080, "checksum": "9b1128ff6fa12bcf5bbdff0021ecbd99", "filetype": "m", "mime_type": "video/quicktime", "vernon_id": "", "audio_codec": "aac", "video_codec": "h264", "duration_hms": "00:01:34:06", "duration_secs": 94.375, "audio_bit_rate": 319994, "audio_channels": 2, "video_bit_rate": 14757194, "file_size_bytes": 177925516, "overall_bit_rate": 15082427, "video_frame_rate": 16.0, "audio_sample_rate": 48000, "creation_datetime": "2017-06-28 23:40:10+00:00", "audio_max_bit_rate": 128000, "video_max_bit_rate": null}, "access_metadata": {"title": "B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps", "width": 1452, "height": 1080, "checksum": "266454b629cbc8073e86e00105b2d2db", "filetype": "a", "mime_type": "video/mp4", "vernon_id": "", "audio_codec": "aac", "video_codec": "h264", "duration_hms": "00:01:34:06", "duration_secs": 94.4, "audio_bit_rate": 2275, "audio_channels": 2, "video_bit_rate": 5564175, "file_size_bytes": 65716308, "overall_bit_rate": 5569178, "video_frame_rate": 16.0, "audio_sample_rate": 48000, "creation_datetime": "2020-10-08 22:36:51.517360+11:00", "audio_max_bit_rate": 128000, "video_max_bit_rate": null}, "web_metadata": {"title": "B2003553_JohnAndersonHomeMovies_Reel5_Access_presentation_16fps", "width": 1452, "height": 1080, "checksum": "2ee346e34d60a17b8e5d58f5704c6920", "filetype": "w", "mime_type": "video/mp4", "vernon_id": "", "audio_codec": "aac", "video_codec": "h264", "duration_hms": "00:01:34:06", "duration_secs": 94.4, "audio_bit_rate": 2275, "audio_channels": 2, "video_bit_rate": 2379243, "file_size_bytes": 28144066, "overall_bit_rate": 2385090, "video_frame_rate": 16.0, "audio_sample_rate": 48000, "creation_datetime": "2020-10-08 22:40:29.795230+11:00", "audio_max_bit_rate": 128000, "video_max_bit_rate": null}, "access_level": "View anywhere", "snapshot": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/snapshot_1218_31s.jpg", "animated_snapshot": ""}], "holdings": [{"name": "9.5mm film;

THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>Star From Afar is a powerful example of Socialist Realism, an art form developed in the Soviet Union to promote the ideals of socialism and communism. The film unquestionably aims to communicate a positive communist message to its audience. Yunyun&#8217;s father is labeled a &#8220;capitalist sympathiser&#8221; and disciplined accordingly, learning a valuable lesson about the assets of Socialist China. The film frowns upon old-fashioned values such as male chauvinism and champions the modernisation of China, particularly the progression of women.<br />\n(2 stars - Aleena Glentis; November 3, 2011)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Star from afar = Yuan fang de xin</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wu Peimin and Xiaoxiang Film Studio</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1983</p>", "description": "<p>Flashback – Yunyun, a passionate vet from Shanghai, receives a position at The New Star Dairy farm in a rural Chinese town.

When she arrives, she is greeted by her new colleague Jianxin. Treating her with great admiration, he takes her by tractor to the farm, which is still being built. He explains her job to her – to tend to the dairy cows.</p>\n<p>Settling in to her new position, Yunyun explains to Jianxin that she went to veterinary school after her father was accused of being a capitalist sympathiser. During this time, she was also sent to live on a commune. Jianxin explains to her that the leader of the village, Mr. Wang, proposed the construction of a dairy farm so that the locals can receive better diets.</p>\n<p>Present – Yunyun&#8217;s parents are concerned for their daughter&#8217;s welfare. After returning from the dairy farm at their request, she has since appeared melancholy. When they ask about her new position at the library, she complains she is unfit for the job, and that she still yearns to be a vet. When her mother suggests that she find work on a dairy farm closer to home, Yunyun explains that the solution is not that simple.</p>\n<p>Ruping, a friend of Yunyun&#8217;s, takes her to the Shanghai Zoo. Although he hopes to impress Yunyun and her love of animals, she spends the entire time complaining about how unhappy and uncared for the animals appear to be. Yunyun expresses an interest in getting a job at the zoo so she can impart her knowledge on the workers. Seeing a group of friends enjoying themselves, Yunyun flashes back to her time on the dairy farm, and the night they spent feasting on fish by the riverside.</p>\n<p>Back in the present, Yunyun runs into a friend from the dairy farm, and they are delighted to see each other. Yunyun asks about Jianxin, and learns he has been made director of the farm. Yunyun appears to miss Jianxin, confessing to her friend her feelings for him. Her friend implies Jianxin feels the same way too.</p>\n<p>Flashback – When Yunyun suggests they move the cows, the men at the farm tease her, saying the work is too hard for a woman. Jianxin praises her initiative, and the modernisation of China. As Yunyun and Jianxin attempt to move the cows, they discover one of the dairy cows has gone into labour. The next day, after having sat beside her all night, they help the cow deliver, naming the calf Little Star.</p>\n<p>Back in the present, Ruping asks Yunyun when they will become engaged. She insists they remain friends. Yunyun meets with her friend from the farm, and they reminisce on her time there. Yunyun asking about Little Star, and is delighted to find out she has now given birth herself.</p>\n<p>When Yunyun&#8217;s friend asks her why she left the farm, Yunyun has another flashback. The dairy farm is abandoned by the committee. Jianxin has faith that they will one day operate again. Yunyun sadly and reluctantly leaves, returning home to her family, who has sent for her. Jianxin is upset with Yunyun for leaving the farm at such a crucial time. When she asks Jianxin if he will see her off, he cruelly says, &#8220;I won&#8217;t see a deserter off&#8221;. Distraught, Yunyun leaves.</p>\n<p>Yunyun explains to her friend that her father won&#8217;t let return to the farm.

One of the girls, Ling Zhi, has a terrible flu, but pushes on with the preparations. In another room, Madame Jin sings about the loss of her child, 12 years ago. She laments her husband&#8217;s subsequent death, seemingly in the difficult struggle to find their son and restore the male heir. Her brother, Uncle Jin, arrives with his son Jin Hu, offering him up for adoption so that Madame Jin can finally have the son she always desired. When she expresses a longing for her biological son, Uncle Jin storms off in anger. The mysterious woman from the river – Madame Jin&#8217;s servant – enters, claiming to have found her long lost son. Ecstatically happy, Madame enlists her to collect her son and thank his foster mother for her help.</p>\n<p>Er Long tells Da Long that he is afraid that the rumour is true, and that he will be taken away from the family. While she weaves fabric, Tong Hua reflects on her adoption of Da Long, and regrets that she has kept it secret from him for 12 years. Madame Jin&#8217;s servant returns, revealing to Tong Hua that Madame Jin did not die 12 years ago, that she is alive and well and has been desperately looking for her son. Tong Hua refuses to believe her, and is unwilling to let go of the son that she has raised as her own for all these years.<br />\nThe servant makes a plan with some local children to take the child against his will when he returns, and after a struggle with the brothers, they succeed. Tong Hua returns to discover her son is gone, finding some monetary compensation on the counter. Er Long explains the situation to his mother, who, devastated, cries out in agony for her son.</p>\n<p>When Da Long arrives at Madame Jin&#8217;s palace, she is surprised to discover her son is a peasant, having been raised in a peasant family. She tries to embrace him, apologising for all the suffering he has endured, but all he can do is cry out for his mother.</p>\n<p>Back at home, Tong Hua takes to bed, devastated by the abduction of her son. When Er Long tries to comfort her, she reveals that Madame Jin has taken the wrong son, and that Er Long is the adopted child. Although he is visibly heartbroken, she suggests they set out to find Madame Jin and return each son to his rightful mother.</p>\n<p>Several months later at Madame Jin&#8217;s palace, Da Long attempts to settle into his newfound wealth, yet feels awkward and out of place. He can&#8217;t stand being called Master by his servants, and feels uncomfortable in his opulent clothing.

Finally, they stumble upon the gates of the palace. She introduces herself to Madame Jin and returns the monetary compensation. She also introduces Madame Jin to her actual biological son, Er Long. Madame Jin comprehends the mix up as soon as she realizes that Er Long looks exactly like her late husband, is tall, good-looking and well mannered. Although Er Long hesistates, he appears to fit into Madame Jin&#8217;s lifestyle more than his brother.

They are the pioneers of seeking truth; they are the friends of the Chinese forever.<br />\nBased on the biography of American journalist Helen Snow, who journeyed into China during the pre-World War II era and uncovered the story of the Communist Party in China. The film opens with the murder of a Caucasian woman by a group of masked men; after the murder they realise that their victim was not the intended one. The narrative takes place in China, it is the early stages of the civil war; we are introduced to the Central Army (The Kuomintang) and the North West Army. A telegram arrives for Captain Ou Yang-Chuan, of the Central Army, notifying him of the arrival of American reporter Helen Snow, and instructing him to control her activities while she is in China. Snow is stopped at the train station by officials who inform her of the blacklisting of her husband, Edgar Snow; and due to association, she too is forbidden to enter the country. Captain Ou eventually takes care of the situation by permitting Snow to remain in the country for 24 hours. Placing Snow under strict watch, she is told to remain at a designated hotel. After several attempts she manages to sneak off without her guards, and she meets a former student of her husband who is involved with the Red Army (the North West Army). They devise a plan for Snow to leave the city and enter the restricted war zones. The rest of the narrative involves Snow&#8217;s execution of these plans, of the obstacles that come her way; unexpected allies are made and the mystery of the hooded men is eventually revealed.</p>\n<p>Historical Background:<br />\nThe world&#8217;s largest political party, the Communist Party of China (CPC or CCP) was founded in May 1921 in Shanghai, and came to rule all of mainland China in 1949 after defeating its rival the Kuomintang (KMT) in the Chinese Civil War. The Western world first got a clear view of the main base of the Communist Party of China through Edgar Snow&#8217;s Red Star Over China. Snow was also the first person to present  Mao as the main leader, as he was previously seen as just a guerrilla leader. Snow&#8217;s book, along with Pearl Buck&#8217;s &#8216;The Good Earth&#8217;, was the most influential book on Western understanding and sympathy for China in the 1930s. Snow recounts the months that he spent with the Chinese Red Army in the summer and fall of 1936. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports of what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Snow&#8217;s status as an international journalist not previously identified with the communist movement gave his reports the stamp of authenticity. The glowing pictures of life in the communist areas contrasted with the gloom and corruption of the Nationalist government. Many Chinese learned about Mao and the communist movement from the almost immediate translations of Mao&#8217;s autobiography, and readers in North America and Europe, especially those with liberal views, were heartened to learn of a movement which they interpreted as being anti-Fascist and progressive. Snow reported clearly Mao&#8217;s new United Front policy as one which would leave violent class struggles behind. Although Snow made clear that Mao&#8217;s ultimate aim was control of China, many readers got the impression that the Chinese communists were &#8220;agrarian reformers&#8221;. Many critics refer to Snow&#8217;s accounts as &#8220;myths&#8221;, which presents a romanticized and partial view; in the West, it is often blamed for the rise of Mao&#8217;s communism.<br />\nHelen Foster Snow was an American journalist who reported from China in the 1930s on the developing revolution in China and the Korean independence movement. While, like her husband, Edgar Snow, she was never a member of the Chinese or American Communist Party, she was sympathetic to the revolutionaries in China, whom she compared favourably to the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek. In the late 1940s, critics grouped her with the China Hands as one of those responsible for the &#8220;loss of China&#8221;, one who went beyond sympathy to active support of Mao&#8217;s revolution.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nIt is interesting that the film focuses on Helen Snow&#8217;s experiences in China instead of her husband&#8217;s. Snow is portrayed as a brave and unconventional character. The choice of representing the Snows&#8217; heroism through a female figure can be linked to the ideological underpinnings of Communist China. For centuries before the early 1900s, women were greatly deprived of rights and were present mainly to serve men. Women served as slaves, concubines, and prostitutes. It was Mao who established some equality between the two genders; he believed that the enforcement of gender equality could make China a world power.

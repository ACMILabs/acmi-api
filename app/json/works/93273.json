During his short acting career he became a cult hero for the youth of the 50&#8217;s, a rebel and an individualist whose sensitive and intense portrayals, particularly in &#8220;East of Eden&#8221; (1955, dir. Elia Kazan) and &#8220;Rebel without a cause&#8221; (1955, dir. Nicholas Ray) shot him to legend status almost overnight.

George Stevens), where he starred alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper and Carol Baker. This special Collector&#8217;s Classic contains some rare archival newsreel footage, stills, film excerpts from his three feature films, biographical details with personal narratives from friends and actors including Carol Baker, Dennis Hopper, Jack Larson, Natalie Wood among others, career highlights including footage of many of his bit parts in film and television, and finally a complete and uncut version of &#8220;The Unlighted road&#8221; (1951) which featured in the television series &#8220;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars.

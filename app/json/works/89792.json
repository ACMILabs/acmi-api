The narrative shifts from Private to General, from Lieutenant to Seargent, a continuous fragmented voice-over in which the audience is made to confront the fears and terrors that every soldier must face in battle. Malick contrasts the lush savage beauty of the Solomon Islands with the glistening weapons of war brought in by the Americans and the Japanese, and the film moves from becoming the story of a battle to becoming a tragically moving anti-war epic. That Malick is able to see the suffering and humiliation of war and defeat, while making a film about one of the most successful American campaigns in World War II history, is a testament to his commitment to universalist humanist values. The outstanding musical score, blending classical, western and Polynesian music, is by Hans Zimmer; the ravishing cinematography is by John Toll. In a cast distinguished by fine ensemble playing, Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte and Elias Koteas are outstanding.

Colonel Serguei Kotov is a military hero of the Bolshevik Revolution who is surrounded by loving family and comrades.

By encapsulating the drama of betrayal, corruption and totalitarianism in the personal struggle of Kotov to make sense of what it happening to himself and his family, this film offers both a powerful examination of the Stalinist era as well as acknowledging the impossibility of any one film, any one document being able to fully represent the horror of a period in which millions lost their lives, their dreams and their sanity.

Told in the director&#8217;s usual minimalist style, &#8216;L&#8217;Argent&#8217; (Money) traces the path of destruction a forged bank note leaves when two upper class school boys try to pass it off onto an unsuspecting photography shop. The shop owner then knowingly hands it over to a delivery driver who is arrested for carrying the counterfeit money. As a consequence the delivery driver&#8217;s life descends into a series of tragic misfortunes which lead from petty theft to cold blooded murder, while the privileged school boys and shop keeper remain untarnished.

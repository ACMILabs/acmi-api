And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back. I said, well, just get me some boots and I&#8217;ll be right.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:04:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community life", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Australian football", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - Australia - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Victorian Football League", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1135979, "name": "Malcolm McKinnon", "creator_id": 8858, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1388, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtwxvJHsGJk"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "186523", "production_places": [{"id": 40, "name": "VIC/Australia", "slug": "vicaustralia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2007", "notes": "", "to_year": "2007"}], "labels": [58701]}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This video footage is of a suspension performance entitled &#8220;Event for Stretched Skin No. 4&#8221; that took place at the Art Academy in Munich, Germany on 8 August 1977.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, this was Stelarc&#8217;s fourth suspension performance, in which the artist&#8217;s body is suspended in space by a series of hooks inserted into the skin.

All of the women assembled there are at transitional stages in their life, questioning the choices they have made: Georgina doubts her relationship with her female live-in lover, the perennially depressed Chris; Marcy is attempting to shake off a former lover who has taken to stalking her; Jill is pregnant with her second child. The many verbal exchanges reveal the petty jealousies that exist within the group, especially the rivalry between the straight-laced Rachel and her wilder and less inhibited sister, Jill. The friends discuss sex at great length, disclosing their fantasies, inhibitions, desires and sexual history. &#8220;Live nude girls&#8221; is a comedy that explores the territory of female sexuality, explicitly displaying the women&#8217;s numerous erotic fantasises and sexual experiences.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Erotica", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/live-nude-girls", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1975447, "name": "Julianna Lavin", "creator_id": 80339, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q107541526", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975446, "name": "Barry Bernardi", "creator_id": 51591, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975445, "name": "Steve White", "creator_id": 80338, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7614290", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975444, "name": "Steve White Properties", "creator_id": 35351, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1975443, "name": "Republic Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 22029, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51123", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [33055], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93551, "acmi_id": "317006", "title": "Vampire lovers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "vampire-lovers", "creator_credit": "Roy Baker, Michael Style, Harry Fine, American International Pictures (AIP) and Hammer Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1970", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In 18th century Styria, Austria, a series of mysterious deaths causes superstitious villagers to suspect vampires abound.

This documentary tracks the evolution of Mizrahi&#8217;s next collection - from fledging moments of inspiration to final parade. &#8220;Unzipped&#8221; is a frank examination of the fashion industry at work - the superficiality, demands, personalities, exhaustion, frustrations, setbacks, camaraderie and creativity of it all. Supermodels take centre stage and the precociousness of this elite group is in evident abundance. Mizrahi seeks guidance from a diverse range of sources (including a ouija board) as he aims to evoke the look and style of an Inuit, mixed with 1950s cheesecake aesthetic, meets Mary Tyler Moore. Mizrahi&#8217;s mother is interviewed and gives insights into her son&#8217;s precocious talent, recognised and nurtured by her. Directed by Douglas Keeve, &#8220;Unzipped&#8221; is a candid examination of the sparks that fly when creative urges seek to ally financial interest. Features appearances from Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen, Richard Gere, Eartha Kitt, Sandra Bernhard and Kate Moss.

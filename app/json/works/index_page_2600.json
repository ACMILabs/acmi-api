Marilia Pera is outstanding as the Brazilian leader of the Mercentanos gang. She is a drug-dealer and pimp, but also mother to a group of teenage boys who obey her every command, be it shooting a rival or doing the laundry. &#8220;Mixed Blood&#8221; is violent and disturbing but it maintains a comic tone throughout that refuses sentimentality and cliche. This is a drug &#8220;exploitation&#8221; movie scored to a festive, breezy Latin beat.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hispanic Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gangs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hispanic Americans", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2162391, "name": "Paul Morrissey", "creator_id": 63906, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q383764", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2162386, "name": "Antoine Gannage", "creator_id": 77104, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040193", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2162389, "name": "Steven Fierberg", "creator_id": 77105, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q106266755", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2162384, "name": "Sara Films", "creator_id": 23740, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035091", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2162383, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38131", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [21730]}]}

Particular attention is paid to the formation of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the influence and legacy of its first Federal Commissioner- Anslinger. The program is divided into the war on drugs over the years, 1937-47, 1948-63, 1964-69, 1970-77, 1980-98 and defines the &#8220;official truth&#8221; about dope for the era (which covers a wide array of truths - linking it to degeneracy, heroin addiction, communism), and which strata of society was most associated with its usage at the time. What emerges is a political campaign that has increased from a $220 million dollar investment to a $214.7 billion one that continues on regardless.

Cast includes Audine Lieth, Marcus Graham, Anne Phelan, Gary Sweet and Jacqueline McKenzie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Poverty - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Unemployment - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "History&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "History&nbsp;→ Poverty - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Unemployment - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Mini-series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 805976, "name": "George Ogilvie", "creator_id": 20795, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 805975, "name": "Gus Howard", "creator_id": 75853, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 805974, "name": "South Australian Film Corporation", "creator_id": 53697, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 805973, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47821", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [30065]}, {"id": 65264, "acmi_id": "320044", "title": "The Battle of Wangapore", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-battle-of-wangapore", "creator_credit": "John Daborn and Grasshopper Group", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1955", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1955-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this satirical animation British troops under a typical Colonel Blimp test the turbanned and rebellious riff-raff from over the border and all with a stiff sense of propriety.

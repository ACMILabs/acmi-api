The catalyst for her reinvigoration so late in life is her little dog, who metamorphosises before her eyes only, into a frisky, carefree older woman. The pair become inseparable playmates much to the consternation of Beryl&#8217;s uptight daughter who sees only a spoilt dog and fears for her mother&#8217;s sanity. A film that touches on universal themes such as life after death of a loved one, caring for the aged, discovering your other half and taking control of your own happiness.

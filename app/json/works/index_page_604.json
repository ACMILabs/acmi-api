The foundation of our present day Halloween in the ancient Celtic Feast of the Dead, where the earthly and supernatural world were said to intersect with nightmarish possibilities, is given as a striking example of a softened contemporary translation of ancient folklore. To this end a study is also made of the present day translation of Celtic religion, seen as a fairly removed version of the powerful Druidism of ancient times where, firmly routed in an engagement with nature, Druids were trained for twenty years to take their position in the highest priestly caste of the three orders and where great importance was placed on poetic Bards, sacrifice and no less than 200 gods and goddesses. The Druids&#8217; fearful appearance to the Romans is also detailed, along with the stories of Druid rebellion against Roman invasion, let down in the end by lack of organisation against the most disciplined army of the world at that time and resulting in many elements of Druidism being banned or encapsulated in Catholicism.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Celts", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholic Church", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Catholics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Goddess religion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Paganism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion and culture", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religions", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Archaeology", "History&nbsp;→ Celts", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Europe - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - History", "History&nbsp;→ Celts - Ireland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Civilization, Celtic", "History&nbsp;→ Goddess religion", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Paganism", "History&nbsp;→ Religions", "History&nbsp;→ Religions - History", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1676112, "name": "J Williams", "creator_id": 80007, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1676111, "name": "Caryl Ebenezer", "creator_id": 80006, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1676110, "name": "Comataldh Craolaidh Gaidhlig", "creator_id": 34537, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1676109, "name": "S4C International", "creator_id": 34536, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1676108, "name": "Sianel 4 Cymru (S4C) (Channel 4 Wales)", "creator_id": 25343, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1676107, "name": "Opus Television", "creator_id": 34535, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1676106, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115568, "acmi_id": "S01404", "title": "The Celts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-celts", "creator_credit": "J Williams, Caryl Ebenezer, Opus Television and SBS-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93034, "acmi_id": "316394", "title": "A Dead song?

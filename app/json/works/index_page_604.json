Fixating on the opening of John&#8217;s Gospel in the Bible, and drawing inspiration from theology and the scriptures, Wallinger created &#8220;Angel&#8221; (1997), an intriguing video art piece that is a rumination on faith. &#8220;Prometheus&#8221; (1999), a thought-provoking piece, addressing the issues of mortality, morality, the after-life and purgatory, utilises an electric chair, a video component, amid other mediums. Wallinger&#8217;s art is often witty and immediately accessible yet at the same time it engages with some grand themes - religion, spirituality, life and death. In an interesting interview Wallinger discusses his identity as a British artist and his interest in horse racing, identifying it as an exaggerated microcosm of British society, as well as the meanings, motivations and ambitions that drive his creative spirit.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language",

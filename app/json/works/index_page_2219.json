One morning, a mysterious woman approaches Da Long, claiming that his mother, Tong Hua, is not his birth mother. He returns home, upset and confused by the mysterious woman.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at a lavish garden property, a group of female servants prepare for Madame Jin&#8217;s 30th birthday party. One of the girls, Ling Zhi, has a terrible flu, but pushes on with the preparations. In another room, Madame Jin sings about the loss of her child, 12 years ago. She laments her husband&#8217;s subsequent death, seemingly in the difficult struggle to find their son and restore the male heir. Her brother, Uncle Jin, arrives with his son Jin Hu, offering him up for adoption so that Madame Jin can finally have the son she always desired. When she expresses a longing for her biological son, Uncle Jin storms off in anger. The mysterious woman from the river – Madame Jin&#8217;s servant – enters, claiming to have found her long lost son. Ecstatically happy, Madame enlists her to collect her son and thank his foster mother for her help.</p>\n<p>Er Long tells Da Long that he is afraid that the rumour is true, and that he will be taken away from the family. While she weaves fabric, Tong Hua reflects on her adoption of Da Long, and regrets that she has kept it secret from him for 12 years. Madame Jin&#8217;s servant returns, revealing to Tong Hua that Madame Jin did not die 12 years ago, that she is alive and well and has been desperately looking for her son. Tong Hua refuses to believe her, and is unwilling to let go of the son that she has raised as her own for all these years.<br />\nThe servant makes a plan with some local children to take the child against his will when he returns, and after a struggle with the brothers, they succeed. Tong Hua returns to discover her son is gone, finding some monetary compensation on the counter. Er Long explains the situation to his mother, who, devastated, cries out in agony for her son.</p>\n<p>When Da Long arrives at Madame Jin&#8217;s palace, she is surprised to discover her son is a peasant, having been raised in a peasant family. She tries to embrace him, apologising for all the suffering he has endured, but all he can do is cry out for his mother.</p>\n<p>Back at home, Tong Hua takes to bed, devastated by the abduction of her son. When Er Long tries to comfort her, she reveals that Madame Jin has taken the wrong son, and that Er Long is the adopted child. Although he is visibly heartbroken, she suggests they set out to find Madame Jin and return each son to his rightful mother.</p>\n<p>Several months later at Madame Jin&#8217;s palace, Da Long attempts to settle into his newfound wealth, yet feels awkward and out of place. He can&#8217;t stand being called Master by his servants, and feels uncomfortable in his opulent clothing.

Uncle Jin arrives, scolding his sister for letting her son get away with his &#8220;peasant behaviour&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Tong Hua and Er Long are shown travelling a great distance and in extreme weather in search of the Da Long. Four years have passed since he was taken away. Tong Hua resents Madame Jin for taking Da Long away without leaving any details, leaving her no choice but to travel far and wide in search of him. Finally, they stumble upon the gates of the palace. She introduces herself to Madame Jin and returns the monetary compensation. She also introduces Madame Jin to her actual biological son, Er Long. Madame Jin comprehends the mix up as soon as she realizes that Er Long looks exactly like her late husband, is tall, good-looking and well mannered.

Tong Hua refuses payment from Madame Jin, and only wants the best for her children.</p>\n<p>Da Long returns a changed man, arrogant and proud of his wealth.

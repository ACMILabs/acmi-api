We see a country of fourteen million people where only one out of five is white. Edgar McInnis gives a dispassionate appraisal of the motivations behind the policy of apartheid and of whether the practice of segregation provides a satisfactory solution. This documentary provides a comprehensive overview of the history of South African colonisation, the apartheid system and the country&#8217;s political developments using re-enactments, drawings, interviews and historic footage.

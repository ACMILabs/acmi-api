The CIA counter attacked with their own espionage operations.

In 1986, the Chernobyl disaster rocked the Soviet Union and six months later, Gorbachev and Reagan agreed to the complete withdrawal of intermediate range missiles in Europe and a 50% reduction in ballistic missiles over a five year period. However, during all of this negotiating, Reagan persisted with his &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; theory, or Strategic Defense Initiative through to the end of his presidency in 1989. Gorbachev&#8217;s perestroika began filtering through the Soviet bloc, including Hungary and Poland, but the most dramatic moment came when in 1989 the Berlin Wall came down, opening up East and West Berlin.

Hill tries to keep the central conflict interesting but the variety of sub-plots and the many scenes of testosterone fuelled vicious encounters, muddies the narrative focus.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mexico", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Texas", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Places&nbsp;→ Mexico", "Places&nbsp;→ Texas"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/extreme-prejudice", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997518, "name": "Walter Hill", "creator_id": 71303, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q350422", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997517, "name": "Buzz Feitshans", "creator_id": 64135, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q15455603", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997515, "name": "Carolco Pictures", "creator_id": 70699, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997516, "name": "Tri-Star Pictures", "creator_id": 22768, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50886", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [32841]}, {"id": 93335, "acmi_id": "316754", "title": "How to steal a million", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "how-to-steal-a-million", "creator_credit": "William Wyler, Fred Kohlmar and World Wide Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1966", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1966-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45183, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q658847"}], "brief_description": "<p>How to steal a million is a romantic comedy caper film that re-teams star Audrey Hepburn and director William Wyler thirteen years after their classic film &#8220;Roman holiday&#8221; was made. &#8220;How to steal a million&#8221; is set among the high-end fine art world of museums, collectors, dealers and con-artists.

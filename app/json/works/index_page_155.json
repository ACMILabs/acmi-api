Robert Redford plays the quiet and unassuming middle-aged Roy Hobbs who at the age of 14 hand-carved his own baseball bat from a tree struck down by lightning on the farm where he lived.

The story climaxes to a tense and spectacular final sequence as our hero takes the bat in a nail-biting challenge to win the pennant for his Knights.

The program contains extensive interviews and commentary from Ernst himself which details the pattern of his life and work from his founding influence in the Surrealist movement, throughout World War II and his struggles within and without Germany up to his settlement in America and then move back to Europe. Opening with an outline of the commencement of the Dada movement in 1919, the program discusses the life history of Ernst from his move to Paris before World War II and his association and friendship with Paul Eluard along with other founding members of the Surrealist group. The details of his artistic interests in natural history made strange, that is, the confusion of disparate beings and objects in nature through mind and poetic associations, are discussed in terms of his public work as well as that undertaken in more personal spaces such as murals in friends houses and sculptures and exterior murals adorning his own various residences. With the advent of Hitler&#8217;s power in Germany, his works as a mirror to a &#8216;mad time&#8217; are studied, along with the progress of Ernst away from the Surrealist movement before World War II. At the commencement of the war, a trying era began for Ernst of imprisonments at various stages in France for his German citizenship and as a result of false accusations, spending a few months in a concentration camp, which led to his subsequent difficult, but finally successful move to America with the help of colleague and third wife Peggy Guggenheim and the New York art scene. Here the program details his first Surrealist Exhibition in New York and his invention of what is now known as action painting, all received with great critical acclaim, and his following career in New York, during which time he married the painter, Dorothea Tanning.

In the 1950s, his return to Europe was met with little recognition, but following the receipt of the Grand Prix of Venice in 1954, his acclaim saw an establishment of his freedom to experiment with his progression of interests in painting and sculpture once again. The program closes with an analysis of his work at this stage where his final settlement in the &#8216;Garden of France&#8217; with Dorothea is discussed with reference to the hopeful nuances of his later series of paintings that studied the idea of the cage, and most symbolically, an empty cage from which a bird had escaped.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Max Ernst</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, RM Arts and Peter Schamoni</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Germany, 1991</p>", "description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;Phaidon art collection&#8221;.<br />\nTraces the history of renowned painter and sculptor, Max Ernst, his personal life as well as artistic career.

Low-resolution graphics and a distinctive design style support the raw, and grungy atmosphere of Melanie&amp;#8217;s world. The main interface is a map. The map promises adventure and danger, hinted at by the areas of the map lighting up. The offscreen sounds include dogs barking, gunshots and a car engine turning over. The narrative structure of Mauve Desert makes the user get stuck at certain points. We can only sit back and watch. Sometimes an area is available to click on, sometimes that area will not respond, encouraging the user to be opportunistic in future encounters. Different pieces of video will be produced at particular intervals, suggesting that an underlying logic holds the project together. The theme of understanding and interpretation is also reflected in the layers within the project where fact is merged with fiction. There is Maude Laures, the academic, who stumbles upon Melanie&amp;#8217;s life in a second-hand bookshop.

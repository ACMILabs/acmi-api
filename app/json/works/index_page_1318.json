Footage seen in recent days include protestors fighting with authorities in high-rise stairways (embedded below) and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1596687049901637632\">medical authorities patrolling daily Covid tests with machine guns</a>. However, without the usual verification methods used by traditional media outlets, it&#8217;s hard to be certain of the authenticity of videos. Meanwhile, anti-lockdown activists in other countries have been quick to point out that many countries suppressed anti-lockdown protests.</p>\n<p>The uprisings are being likened to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Film of that protest&#8217;s most iconic images – <a href=\"https://www.acmi.net.au/works/107530--graphic-tank-man-in-tiananmen-square-china-1989/\">showing the lone &#8216;Tank Man&#8217; standing up against the military</a> – were smuggled out of the country. Today, that smuggling and dissemination is happening over digital networks. Unlike the Tiananmen Square protests, which only happened in Beijing, this recent round of protests are happening around the country.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>The media is strictly controlled in China by a variety of regulatory guidelines, including not broadcasting pro-democracy movements.

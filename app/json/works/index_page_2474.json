Sergio is a landlord and self-styled writer who decides to remain behind when his wife, family and friends, whom he ridicules, leave for Miami. But Sergio is unable to commit himself to the revolution either, and so remains only a sceptical observer. His perceptions of Cuban society, both before and after the revolution, are skillfully interwoven with documentary footage of historical events (the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and so on) to yield a complex and fascinating portrait of an individual alienated from the social process around him. Based on the novel by Esmundo Desnoes. In Spanish with English subtitles.

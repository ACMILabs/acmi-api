Mexico in fact celebrated the 100th anniversary of the danzon in the 1990s. Sensual and seductive, danzon expresses the unspoken relationship which exists between the dancing partners, where &#8220;the man commands and the woman obeys; the man seduces and the woman shines&#8221; and for Julia, when Carmelo (Daniel Rergis), her suave and elegant dancing partner of ten years, mysteriously disappears one night, life suddenly becomes meaningless. Julia sets out determinedly to find Carmelo, following a trail of clues to Vera Cruz where she encounters an eclectic mix of new friends including a motherly hotel manager with an acerbic tongue, a prostitute with a young baby, and a transvestite named Susy (Tito Vasconcelos).

The film shifts abruptly between Stella&#8217;s romanticised interior world of memories and fantasies, and the real world where her rage erupts into acts of vandalism and often poetic revenge on the men who have mistreated her. Giedroyc draws on her former experience as a director of realist drama and documentary for British television, handling the often confronting subject matter frankly and suffusing the film with a sense of outrage and urgency. Cast includes Kelly Macdonald, James Bolam, Hans Matheson and Ewan Stewart.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Scotland - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Prostitutes - Personal narratives", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex crimes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "People&nbsp;→ Prostitutes - Personal narratives"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960668, "name": "Compulsive Films", "creator_id": 34096, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960669, "name": "Sidewalk Productions", "creator_id": 34097, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960670, "name": "BFI", "creator_id": 68434, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960671, "name": "Channel Four Television", "creator_id": 25260, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960672, "name": "Adam Barker", "creator_id": 79842, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960673, "name": "Coky Giedroyc", "creator_id": 79843, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49954", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [31970]}, {"id": 84540, "acmi_id": "305857", "title": "Stella Dallas", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stella-dallas", "creator_credit": "Samuel Goldwyn Co, Samuel Goldwyn and King Vidor", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1937", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1937-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Barbara Stanwyck gives one of her best performances as a social-climbing mother from the wrong side of the tracks.

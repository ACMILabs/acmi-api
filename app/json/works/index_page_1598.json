Further, Brooks&#8217;s performance is &#8220;passive&#8221; yet vital, suspended with candour and precision between innocence and childishly fleeting - but intense - emotions. Her emotional vitality and Pabst&#8217;s unobtrusive cutting on action make Pandora the most &#8220;modern&#8221; of silent classics. Cast includes Louise Brooks, Fritz Kortner, Franz Lederer, Carl Goetz, Carl Raschig and Alice Roberts.

Pabst portrays a gallery of characters ranging from the masochistic Schon to the compulsively psychotic Jack the Ripper - and Countess Geschwitz, the screen&#8217;s first unequivocal lesbian - with psychological acuity. Lulu, guileless and sexually ambiguous, is to Tony Rayns &#8220;the literal calm eye of the storm&#8221;.

The first segment is titled, &#8216;The Animals&#8217; and features the family pets including dogs, calves, cows and the audacious cockatoo named Ticka, at home in suburban Heathmont in Melbourne’s outer east.</p>\n<p>There are travel scenes of Narracan East, King River and the &#8216;Astor&#8217; motel at Albury where Charles takes some dramatic footage of the Hume Weir. The family were keen tennis players and visited Albury at Easter so likely took part in the Albury Tennis Association competitions.</p>\n<p>As well are some beach scenes at Point Leo, Golden Beach and Frankston where we see one of the dogs up to its neck in sand and some great examples of sixties bathing suits and sun hats.</p>\n<p>The filmmaker shows some of the great cars at the time so that we see examples of 1960s and 1970s models. A brief segment from the Moomba Festival in Melbourne shows the &#8216;Frankston by the Sea&#8217; song lyrics on one of the floats at the time.</p>\n<p>Charles also shows the family&#8217;s involvement in tennis, trying out an early model Cortina car, and celebrating &#8216;Elinor&#8217;s 21st&#8217; in white gloves and evening gowns and a display of the presents.</p>\n<p>A particular feature of the film is the footage of &#8216;Southgate Fountain&#8217; public art work by Robin Boyd (now demolished to make way for the redevelopment of Southgate on Melbourne&#8217;s Yarra river).</p>\n<p>Originally made using Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:34:00 calves up close<br />\n00:00:53:00 a calf and a dog nuzzling and playing<br />\n00:01:33:00 family pet dog and &#8216;Ticka&#8217;

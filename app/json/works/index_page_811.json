In this instalment Bond is sent to foil Karl Stromberg - a megalomaniac villain who steals the plans to a nuclear tracking device that will allow him to control missiles and rule the world. Bond is sent to Cairo and teams with sexy Russian agent Anya Amasova (Barbara Bach), fending off seductive women and murderous men, in an attempt to retrieve the microfilm. Famous sequences include the pre-credits ski hill chase and a thrilling pursuit through Cairo that turns into an underwater adventure thanks to some deft British technology. Stromberg&#8217;s underwater headquarters make an impressive set piece, and provides ample opportunities for him to feed enemies to man-eating sharks. Richard Kiel stars as Jaws - a memorably gruesome Bond enemy with menacing metal choppers for weaponry.

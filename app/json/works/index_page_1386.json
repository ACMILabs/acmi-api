Though they no longer stand on their heads, they do turn society&#8217;s perception of the elderly on its head<br />\nThis film documents how yoga has helped these women keep physically and mentally strong despite their ageing years. The sense of community that coming to the same teacher for over thirty years has given them has also helped them cope with life&#8217;s challenges. The film centres on Edka, who maintains that yoga has helped her overcome many tragedies in her life, including the death of her husband and daughter.<br />\nBy placing a local, multicultural group of ageing women in the spotlight, it is hoped that Stand on your Head can provide a positive role model for other senior citizens.<br />\nThis &#8216;no-budget&#8217; film was made in Melbourne by local documentary filmmaker, Naomi Wise. The music featured in the film is an old European Jewish folk tune. Indian instruments are used to reflect the curious mix of cultures in the film.

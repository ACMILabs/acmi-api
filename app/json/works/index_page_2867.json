Initially it is the story of two women: Maya, a rebellious servant girl and Tara her mistress and future queen, childhood friends who become adult rivals. Publicly humiliated during Tara&#8217;s nuptial celebrations, a vengeful Maya seduces the king prior to his wedding night. Consequently Maya is spurned and turned out into the street, despite the king&#8217;s burgeoning obsession for her. Maya has an affair with a sculptor of erotic deities, before training as a courtesan, returning to the palace as a professional seductress. Meanwhile the king has fallen into an opium addled, hedonistic stupor that threatens the future of the kingdom. Mira Nair&#8217;s (Mississippi Masala, Salaam Bombay!, Monsoon Wedding) film operates as a critique of the class system and is a tract about self-determination and sexual politics, but it is overwhelmed by a simplistic script and predictable character developments.

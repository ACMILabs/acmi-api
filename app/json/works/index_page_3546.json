France (a surrogate for the filmmaker), revisiting the Cameroons, flashes back to scenes of her youth when her father was a French colonial official. The precarious equilibrium of their household (the mother is attracted to a young black servant) is disturbed by the sudden arrival of a group of outsiders, both European and African, after the forced landing of their plane nearby.

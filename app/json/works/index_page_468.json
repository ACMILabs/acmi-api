However, what is so different with this portrayal of Theodora is the way internationally renowned director Peter Sellars has set the story in modern day America including the final chilling scene of martyrdom being represented by Theodora and Didymus&#8217;s execution by lethal injection. The stark stage setting is evocative with its lighting and shadows and manages to create the desired moods of emotion and drama. A powerful performance by Dawn Upshaw as Theodora, strong and yet sensitive, and an equally excellent performance by David Daniels as Didymus. Supporting cast includes Frode Olsen (Valens), Richard Croft (Septimius), Lorraine Hunt (Irene) and Michael Hart-Davis (Messenger). Also features the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by William Christie, with musical direction by Andrew Davis and accompanied by the Glyndebourne Chorus (chorus master Christopher Moulds). This made for television production of &#8220;Theodora&#8221; was performed at the 1996 Glyndebourne Festival Opera.

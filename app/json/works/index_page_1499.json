Two policemen working in the naturalisation section of the government have to assess the suitability of three immigrants applying for Swiss citizenship&#8212;an Italian baker, a German doctor and a Yugoslavian ballet dancer. Complications arise when the younger policeman falls in love with the dancer, whose suitablity as a Swiss citizen is under question. Realised with a lighter touch than many other satirical films by Swiss directors that parody Swiss society, the film tends towards slapstick and features restrained performances by character actor Luond and cabaret performer Steinberger, as the two policemen. The opening lecture is influenced by the Swiss-born Jean-Luc Godard.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Marcel Hoehn ; director, Rolf Lyssy ; writers, Rolf Lyssy, Christa Maerker ; photography, Fritz E.

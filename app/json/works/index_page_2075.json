Over the course of six weeks, 300 000 people were brutally massacred. The contents of the film range from heart-rending to absurd, as the director tries to approach this highly sensitive event in modern Chinese history.</p>\n<p>Crowds of civilians flee across a bridge, crowding onto boats in an effort to escape the onslaught of the Japanese military. Amongst them are the government officials, abandoning their posts out of sheer terror. A foreign blonde woman drives through the carnage in black car. Arriving at a makeshift hospital, she witnesses the hardship and sufferng the Chinese people are undergoing at the hands of the bombarding. She finds a doctor named Zhan and tells him that there is time for them to secure passage on the last of the departing American ships.</p>\n<p>The invading force rounds up those left behind in the city and takes photos as they gun them down. However, it is immediately visible that there have been issues in casting actual Japanese, as these supposed &#8220;foreign invaders&#8221; all speak fluent Chinese. This accentuates a point of ambivalence which escalates in tandem with the scale of violence they perform.</p>\n<p>At first, the Japanese commander is disturbed that the Yangtze is running red with blood: This does not conform with the image they purport of being the liberators of China. They allow 200 000 refugees to flee into the 3-square-kilometer rat nest of the &#8220;Safety Area&#8221;. Fan, a frightened Chinese photographer and householder, is threatened to develop the Japanese photos of the carnage, or they will burn down his house, kill his children and rape his pregnant wife.</p>\n<p>Strict censorship is enforced so as to prevent news of the carnage from being leaked to the public.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Japanese women in traditional kimono smile and scatter sweets along the ground for the frightenned locals who stand in fear. This scene is actually quite well done, and sets a precedent for the extremes of absurdity we will encounter later in the film.

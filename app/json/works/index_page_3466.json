She is a young vivacious girl thrust suddenly into the machiavellian world of politics when she is tried for treason at the age of 21. Surviving this she becomes Queen, and the film charts the beginning of her reign as she struggles to learn the skills of a monarch. Cate Blanchett is amazing as a young woman who slowly casts off her youth and becomes the legendary Virgin Queen that ruled the Elizabethan age. Shekhar Kapur&#8217;s film manages to be both entertaining and historically insightful. Lavish costumes and an excellent cast make this compelling viewing. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as Elizabeth&#8217;s lover Lord Robert Dudley, Richard Attenborough as Sir William Cecil, and Geoffrey Rush as her political adviser Sir Francis Walsingham.

The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film is in two parts. Part one is of the Gadsden family farm &#8216;Mooltunya&#8217; in country Victoria. The filmmaker&#8217;s wife Jess Gadsden attends her horses, dressed for the farm in gumboots and one of her many headscarfs (seen throughout the films).</p>\n<p>The second part contains a family holiday to Alice Springs and surrounding areas which Ronald introduces by filming from a light plane on the approach to the Outback. Their first stop is to Flynn&#8217;s Grave memorial for John Flynn who among other achievements for the Outback, lobbied for what would become the Flying Doctor Service. Ronald&#8217;s camera shows an appreciation for the landscape they travel through – eucalypts, wildflowers and bees, bushland, rocks formations, dusty roads and the rock wallabies at the MacDonnell Ranges and Uluru. The reel shows a snapshot of Alice Springs in 1978, cars – kombi vans, utes and sedans, seventies fashion including clogs, denim skirts, flares and sunglasses. There are sequences of horseback riding through the bush where Mrs Gadsden shows her prowess among less confident riders and climbing Uluru.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:03:22:00 huge boulders sitting either side of a shed<br />\n00:07:17:00 goanna on rocks<br />\n00:8:16:00 to 00:09:00:00 wing span and over Uluru (Ayre&#8217;s Rock at that time)<br />\n00:10:07:00 ancient Aboringinal rock paintings<br />\n00:11:40:00 walking up Uluru (Ayre&#8217;s Rock at that time)<br />\n00:12:30:00 Ronald and family climb Uluru and find the descent difficult – reinforced by sign warning of the dangers of the climb.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Gadsden Family Home Movie Collection: Reel 19]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ronald Gadsden and Stanley Gadsden</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1978</p>", "description": "<p>The Gadsden Company has a long and proud history of manufacture, dating back to its foundation by Jabez Gadsden in 1879.

Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 23 contains footage of the children&#8217;s display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (also seen in Reel 8).</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 23:</p>\n<p>The whole Reel is devoted to footage of the children&#8217;s display at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (also seen in Reel 8, B2003230). 00:02:32:00 the Queen and Duke are seen getting out of car and walking across the grass, before the camera returns to the athletics, dancing, marching and costumes of the assembled children. There are also scenes of the children relaxing and playing games when not &#8216;performing&#8217; on the MCG.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

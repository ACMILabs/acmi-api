Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition. There are some lovely scenes of skiing without the crowds which includes footage of the panorama and landscape of Falls Creek.</p>\n<p>This film has excellent examples of ski village infrastructure, ski fashion, winter snow fashion, snow vehicles, ski techniques, recreation, and leisure activities particular to the era. The footage of the snow lodge and landscape is a good historical reflection of the architecture, furniture, and the topography of Falls Creek during the 60s.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 Title: Falls Creek 1964<br />\n00:00:18:00 Snowhaven Lodge signage on lodge wall<br />\n00:00:27:00 Exterior shot of Snowhaven Lodge<br />\n00:01:26:00 Children reading and knitting on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:03:23:00 Two people prepare to ski outside the lodge<br />\n00:03:57:00 The family have their meal on the deck of the lodge<br />\n00:04:31:00 Title: NEDSA 1964<br />\n00:06:25:00 A young girl wearing ski goggles exclaims to the camera<br />\n00:06:52:00 Finishing line banner “Kastle Ski” and “Finish”<br />\n00:06:57:00 Skiers standing together with snow-covered slopes in the background<br />\n00:08:19:00 Timekeepers with stop watches and camera stand together with skiers at the end of a run.

There is great delight while eating ice cream from cones, and tears shed when an adult takes an uninvited taste.</p>\n<p>The second, third and fourth sections of the film show the children on a summer’s day in a backyard. Tricycles, a blow-up wading pool with the backyard hose leading into it, swings and a sand pit create a great snapshot of children’s recreation, toys, and equipment particular to the era. We also see a young boy kicking what appears to be an American shaped football and two boys playing with toy cars and a toy police car.</p>\n<p>The fifth section of the film shows a young baby being held by her mother. We then see the baby lying in her pram and being closely inspected and entertained by her older sibling.</p>\n<p>We then go back to the beach with three very young children playing on the water’s edge with their mother beside them. Adults sit on the sand socialising, and there are scenes on the veranda of a holiday house. We see great examples of beach fashion, women&#8217;s hats, and children’s swimsuits.</p>\n<p>This film shows examples of Victoria in the summertime, beach, women’s fashion and children’s fashion, children’s swim wear, vintage toys and a perambulator, children’s leisure and recreation activities that reflect the time.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br

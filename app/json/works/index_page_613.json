When immigrants from Poland and African Americans migrating north from the oppression of the south came together, some magic was made through music - in particular, the formation of Chess Records in 1950 - initially created by two Jewish brothers who were inspired listening to gospel music at a local church. Marc Levin looks at the history of blues by talking to the son of the founder of Chess, Marshall Chess and his take on music and inter-racial relations at the time. Marshall&#8217;s psychodelic inspired project Electric Mud featuring Muddy Waters is a pivotal album in the influential sphere of Chuck D from hip-hop&#8217;s Public Enemy. Exploring his roots, Chuck D, and Marshall, take a tour of Chicago and re-form the Electric Mud Group to pay homage to the &#8216;roots&#8217; of blues and add their own contemporary interpretation. Marshall&#8217;s life in music went beyond the recording industry and he worked in the 1960s for seven years as Company Manager for the Rolling Stones. The take up of the blues by young white musicians in the UK and the US in the 1960s is shown - the cycle of Godfathers influencing the Sons. Features archival performance footage and includes live concert footage of the Chicago Blues Festival and the legendary Koko Taylor at her club. Howlin&#8217; Wolf, Bob Dylan, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Pinetop Perkins, and Ike Turner are some of the artists featured.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration",

On the road - how the early bluesmen made a living was touring from town to town on what became know as &#8216;The Chitlin Circuit&#8217;. Still living that dream is Bobby Rush who owns a bus and takes his show on the road and has &#8220;only been outta work 6 weeks in 41 years&#8221; and by his own admission he&#8217;s either crazy or just loves the music! Not strictly blues, Bobby serves to act as an illustration of some of the trials and tribulations experienced by legendary performers early in their careers, including the influence of the church. B.B. King, Ike Turner, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon, Little Milton, Howlin&#8217; Wolf, Little Milton, Fats Domino and Little Richard are some of the artists featured. Rosco Gordon takes a tour down Beale Street and recalls the past in a timely interview as he passes away at the end of filming, on a tour, in 2002. Memphis had one of the first radio stations on which African Americans appeared as announcers and performers - this proved to be a very lucrative business and a wider audience developed that also included white listeners. Sam Phillips, who is most well known for recording a 19 year-old Elvis, had been recording black artists for some four years before that. Jim Dickinson, musician/producer is also interviewed about the effect the music had on him. When Martin Luther King was assassinated Memphis city officials decided to tear down Beale Street causing an impact on the black history it represented. Broad appeal to white audiences came about in the 1968, culminating in an emotional 95% white audience in front of B.B. King at the Fillmore Auditorium - a new experience for B.B. and one that would mark a change in his audience for good. Ending with a live concert at the WC Handy Awards in 2002, this documentary is sure to inform and inspire.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Road to Memphis</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Robert Kenner, Richard Pearce, Alex Gibney, Margaret Bodde, Reverse Angle International and Vulcan (US)</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 2003</p>", "description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]&#8221;.<br />\nPart of Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;The Blues Collection&#8221;.

Still living that dream is Bobby Rush who owns a bus and takes his show on the road and has &#8220;only been outta work 6 weeks in 41 years&#8221; and by his own admission he&#8217;s either crazy or just loves the music! Not strictly blues, Bobby serves to act as an illustration of some of the trials and tribulations experienced by legendary performers early in their careers, including the influence of the church. B.B. King, Ike Turner, Rufus Thomas, Rosco Gordon, Little Milton, Howlin&#8217; Wolf, Little Milton, Fats Domino and Little Richard are some of the artists featured. Rosco Gordon takes a tour down Beale Street and recalls the past in a timely interview as he passes away at the end of filming, on a tour, in 2002. Memphis had one of the first radio stations on which African Americans appeared as announcers and performers - this proved to be a very lucrative business and a wider audience developed that also included white listeners. Sam Phillips, who is most well known for recording a 19 year-old Elvis, had been recording black artists for some four years before that. Jim Dickinson, musician/producer is also interviewed about the effect the music had on him. When Martin Luther King was assassinated Memphis city officials decided to tear down Beale Street causing an impact on the black history it represented. Broad appeal to white audiences came about in the 1968, culminating in an emotional 95% white audience in front of B.B. King at the Fillmore Auditorium - a new experience for B.B. and one that would mark a change in his audience for good. Ending with a live concert at the WC Handy Awards in 2002, this documentary is sure to inform and inspire.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode of Series &#8220;The Blues Collection = Martin Scorsese presents The Blues a musical journey [DVD]&#8221;.<br />\nPart of Martin Scorsese&#8217;s &#8220;The Blues Collection&#8221;.

Looks at how the nutrient carrying currents and the varying power of the sun interact to control the distribution of life throughout the sea. Shows how the gravitational pull of the moon creates the daily advances and retreats of the tide and how many of the sea creatures take their cue from the moon to reproduce. Explains how seasonal changes transform water temperatures triggering the production of plankton which impacts on the the food chain. Episode 2. &#8216; The Deep&#8217; travels over 900 metres below the surface of the ocean in a submersible observation vessel to explore the creatures that live in these depths. Looks at features which aid an organism&#8217;s survival ensuring that it can detect other creatures without being detected. Movement detectors, camouflage techniques, body structure and sensitive eyes have developed to improve the chances for survival. Episode 3. &#8216;Open oceans&#8217; explores regions located miles away from land, home to the swiftest and most powerful ocean hunters. Creatures in these areas use sonar tracking, water vibrations and exploiting a highly developed sense of smell to detect food in remote areas away from their spawning grounds. Volcanic activity in the ocean creates new land masses and alter the ecology as currents deliver plankton which attracts fish to the new island.

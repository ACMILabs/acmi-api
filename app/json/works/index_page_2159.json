The theme of the film, incarnated in the successive generations of the Borgs, is death-in-life, emotional-spiritual atrophy. It has been compared with King Lear and Strindberg&#8217;s Dream Play and in structure with a Bach fugue. Wild strawberries are a Swedish symbol for the emergence of spring, the rebirth of life.

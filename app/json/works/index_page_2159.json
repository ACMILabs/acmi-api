When Sarah suggests that the others practice more caution, they turn on her, tormenting her ceaselessly after she leaves their circle. Caught in a struggle between reality and illusion, Sarah is forced to invoke a greater power to help defend her against Nancy&#8217;s maliciously twisted magic. The soundtrack for this film features original music by composer Graeme Revell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Occultism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women and religion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witchcraft", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959871, "name": "Andrew Fleming", "creator_id": 79562, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959870, "name": "Douglas Wick", "creator_id": 30214, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959869, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 959868, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19439, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8UCScpzQbeJcSkY7ZgRpblYh0lP.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Craft (Andrew Fleming) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 942, "height": 1413, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48804", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [30930]}]}

became known as &#8220;Supercrook&#8221; thanks to the tabloid journalists. McVicar&#8217;s career of violence began from a young age as a petty thief with a &#8220;bad boy&#8221; reputation, to graduating to armed bank robberies and long prison sentences. Whilst serving an 8 year sentence, McVicar made a successful jail break, only to be recaptured and subsequently have his sentence increased to 23 years in a high security prison. This film focuses on the time spent in that prison, the violence and corruption of the penal system and McVicar&#8217;s loathing of everything the system stands for; always taking the opportunity of pushing the wardens to the limit, by force or otherwise. We see his elaborate plan for escape unfold (based on true facts), and the inevitable resulting climax. In the words of John McVicar in his book, &#8220;Being a thief is a terrific life. But the trouble is they put you in jail for it.&#8221; Whilst in jail, John McVicar enrolled as an external student of Sociology at London University and graduated in 1976 with a First Class Honours Degree. After parole in 1978, he became a successful journalist and broadcaster. Roger Daltrey is quite impressive in his role as McVicar and director Tom Clegg (responsible for many TV series including Hammer House of Horror and Minder), has successfully maintained a grim and somewhat brutal reality of the repressive prison system. Music produced, arranged and conducted by Jeff Wayne, screenplay by John McVicar and Tom Clegg and based on the book written by John McVicar, &#8220;McVicar by himself&#8221;. Cast also includes Adam Faith, Cheryl Campbell, Billy Murray (Beech in &#8220;The Bill&#8221;), Georgina Hale, Steven Berkoff, Ian Hendry.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>McVicar</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Curbishley-Baird Productions, Roy Baird, Bill Curbishley, Roger Daltrey and Tom Clegg</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 1980</p>", "description": "<p>An autobiographical film about John McVicar (played by Roger Daltrey), a notorious British criminal of the 1960s who became known as &#8220;Supercrook&#8221; thanks to the tabloid journalists. McVicar&#8217;s career of violence began from a young age as a petty thief with a &#8220;bad boy&#8221; reputation, to graduating to armed bank robberies and long prison sentences. Whilst serving an 8 year sentence, McVicar made a successful jail break, only to be recaptured and subsequently have his sentence increased to 23 years in a high security prison. This film focuses on the time spent in that prison, the violence and corruption of the penal system and McVicar&#8217;s loathing of everything the system stands for; always taking the opportunity of pushing the wardens to the limit, by force or otherwise.

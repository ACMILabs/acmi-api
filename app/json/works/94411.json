What has excited film buffs about this film is Gance&#8217;s revolutionary use of film techniques - colour tinting, swish pans, handheld shots, lengthy double exposures, and split screens culminating in a twenty-minute triptych sequence, which alternates widescreen panoramas with complex multiple-image montages projected simultaneously on three screens. The film, which is overwhelmingly patriotic, has grandeur worthy of D.W. Griffith; the cast are in the thousands and the set pieces are enormous; the panoramic shots, in particular those projected by three separate reels are stunning. However the score, by Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s father Carmine, is militaristic and fairly insipid, and may grate on some viewers.

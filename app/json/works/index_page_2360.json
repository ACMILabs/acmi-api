Tavernier (Round Midnight, Safe Conduct, D&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s Daughter) displays a true flair for social realism, but he also ably extracts humour and grace from his protagonists, steering away from tabloid exploitation of their depressing circumstances. Philippe Torreton puts in an admirable performance as a man who faces the problems in his personal and professional life with dignity, but also frequently betrays the seething frustration of an idealistic individual operating within a flawed bureaucracy.

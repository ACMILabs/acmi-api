This documentary gathers a group of the founding members of the UAW who share some amusing anecdotes and knowledge that make this oral history a pertinent study of Australia during a politically volatile period.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Publicity", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women in politics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women in trade-unions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women political activists", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women political activists - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women's rights", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women's rights", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Infants - Care and hygiene", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Health and hygiene", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Women - History", "History&nbsp;→ Women's rights", "History&nbsp;→ Women's rights - Australia - History", "People&nbsp;→ Women - Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2098580, "name": "Shona Stephen", "creator_id": 79688, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121361421", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2098573, "name": "AFI [au]", "creator_id": 9711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49441", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [31524]}, {"id": 90970, "acmi_id": "314033", "title": "Appleseed", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "appleseed", "creator_credit": "Kazuyoshi Katayama, Atsushi Sugita, Masaki Sawanobori, Taro Maki and Manga Entertainment", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44989, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2858749"}], "brief_description": "<p>A dark, cyberpunk anime set far in the future.

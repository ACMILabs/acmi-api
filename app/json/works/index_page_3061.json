Contains exciting footage from the 1960 Olympics, and of Ali versus Liston (1964), Williams, Terrell (&#8216;67), Frazier (&#8216;71 and &#8216;74), Ellis (&#8216;71), Foreman (74), Wepner (&#8216;75) and Spinks (&#8216;78). Also addresses Ali&#8217;s religious conversion to Islam, his involvement in the Civil Rights movement - when much of America was divided racially Ali introduced the notion that &#8220;black is beautiful&#8221; - the furore of his refusal to be drafted, his many marriages, post-boxing life and current roles. This work is really a celebration of Ali&#8217;s career - not just as a pugilist, but as a world figure.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Vietnam War, 1961-1975", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans - Civil rights", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Civil rights - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ African Americans - History", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Athletes", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxers - Biography", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Boxers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 924530, "name": "TWI", "creator_id": 33029, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924531, "name": "Carlton Television", "creator_id": 58875, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924532, "name": "Louise Murray", "creator_id": 80520, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924533, "name": "Phil Grabsky", "creator_id": 77957, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 924534, "name": "Phil Grabsky", "creator_id": 77957, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 924529, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51641", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33358]}]}

Tom Savini is reputed to have caused the explosion in popularity of horror films since the eighties as a result of his increasingly realistic and gory special effects devised for these films. Featured are interviews with Tom and other colleagues along with excerpts from some of the horror films in which Savini&#8217;s special effects and make-up design were central to the film, including: &#8220;Friday the 13th&#8221; series, &#8220;Day of the dead&#8221;, &#8220;Martin&#8221;, &#8220;Dawn of the dead&#8221;, &#8220;Knight riders&#8221;, &#8220;Maniac&#8221;, &#8220;Tales from the darkside&#8221; plus more.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Special effects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Costume design - Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Aesthetics", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Horror", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theatrical makeup", "People&nbsp;→ Savini, Tom, 1943-", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 912398, "name": "O'Quinn Productions", "creator_id": 34431, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912399, "name": "Linda Laias", "creator_id": 79960, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912400, "name": "Damon Santostefano", "creator_id": 34433, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 912401, "name": "Damon Santostefano", "creator_id": 34433, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 912397, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

The Track screen references Grace Cossington-Smith’s painting <i>The Bridge in Curve</i> (1926), the Sydney Harbour Bridge near completion. Cossington-Smith celebrates not only the construction of the bridge as a triumph of engineering but also Australian modernism. Gladwell replicates Cossington-Smith’s perspective while celebrating the ways in which the riders have reclaimed the space underneath the bridge as a space for creativity, beyond the intended functionality of the space.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Trials screen references Caspar David Friedrich’s romantic painting <i>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog</i> (1818), in which a man standing on a rocky outcrop looks out onto a stormy ocean. Like Friedrich’s subject, the trials rider is ‘wedged between two time signatures – the slow geological signature of the rocks and the furious swell of the ocean’, as Gladwell describes it. As the rider reaches the top of the rocks he rests, putting his feet to the ground, and takes in the view of the ocean from a vantage point he has worked hard to achieve. Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Gladwell’s rider is insignificant within a landscape while striving for mastery over it.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell<br />\nDual-channel video

As Gladwell describes it: ‘If I were trying to direct a narrative feature with these elements I’d want the film to be the first “ambient” action film… <i>Parallel Forces</i> contains the fragments of a potential action film. It is a series of film sequences reflecting back on itself.’ But this seems to be action that is unencumbered by any narrative framework, explored and enjoyed for its inherent qualities.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>Parallel Forces</i> is an eight-channel video installation commissioned for the exhibition <i>Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences</i> in 2011.</p>\n<p>The eight-screen <i>Parallel Forces</i> is Gladwell’s most ambitious exploration of the dual, mirrored image in terms of scale and composition. With four pairs of opposing screens set on the walls of the gallery like a hall of mirrors, it brings together the key elements of the classic ozploitation film – choppers, fast cars, motorcycles, daring physical feats and dramatic locations – and strips them of any cinematic logic or narrative to create a succession of experiments that play with point of view, audience perspective and the limits of speed.</p>\n<p>On each set of screens a body/machine performs a series of tightly sequenced manoeuvres in parallel while simultaneously fixing its gaze on its opposite across the gallery corridor. In <i>Parallel 2 x EC 120s (French Island)</i>, a cameraman, rigged to a harness attached to the interior of one of two identical Eurocopters, trains his camera on the other helicopter as they both hover above the wetlands and swoop through the rugged terrain of French Island, on Victoria’s south-east coast. The camera captures the impact of the choppers’ movement on the landscape – the brushed grass, the swaying branches. In <i>Parallel 2 x XBs (Silverton)</i> two interceptors (the modified black Ford from George Miller’s Mad Max series) flank each other on the dusty red highways of outback Broken Hill (the Mad Max series location), a cameraman perched on the window with his lens pointed at the vehicle opposite. The car wheels scar the earth with their combined speed and weight, red dust billowing in their wake. On the third set of screens, <i>Parallel 2 x R6s (M5)</i>, twin Yamaha YZs speed through Sydney’s M5 underpass. On the last set, <i>Parallel 2 x 4 ABEC 5s (Domain)</i>, two skateboarders train their cameras through the transparent barrier between the two travelators under Sydney’s Domain car park, again filming each other.</p>\n<p>Caught between these opposing parallels it is impossible for the viewer to calculate the speed and velocity of these bodies and machines. Perfectly matched in their movement and progress towards an unknown entity, there is a sense of movement yet there is no definite evidence that anything is moving at all. As Gladwell describes it: ‘If I were trying to direct a narrative feature with these elements I’d want the film to be the first “ambient” action film… <i>Parallel Forces</i> contains the fragments of a potential action film. It is a series of film sequences reflecting back on itself.’ But this seems to be action that is unencumbered by any narrative framework, explored and enjoyed for its inherent qualities.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell<br />\nEight-channel video installation, variable duration<br />\nACMI Collection</p>", "details": [{"label": "Durations", "display_values": ["", "", "00:14:35:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["8 channels, 4 pairs of videos exhibited approx. 11 metres apart.

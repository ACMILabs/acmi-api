Dan Logan (George C.Scott) is a single father who lives with his son Chris (Nicolas Beauvy) on their sheep ranch in Wyoming. Life can be hard but the close bond between father and son is strong and the environment, although remote, is peaceful. But not for long. Whilst out on a camping trip, Dan&#8217;s world is shattered. The Logan ranch has been accidentally sprayed with a lethal dose of experimental nerve gas by an Army helicopter - Chris is in a coma, the sheep are dead, or dying, and Dan himself is dying. Seeking medical attention Dan finds instead that he is to be used as a guinea pig by the Army doctor, Major Holliford (Martin Sheen) to see what effects the nerve gas has on humans. Bitter, angry and frustrated by what appears to be a cover-up, and the eventual death of his son, Dan seeks revenge in the bloodiest and most brutal way possible. This is George C. Scott&#8217;s second directorial role (&#8220;The Anderson trial&#8221; (1970) television film being his first). The film includes a great support cast with Richard Basehart and Barnard Hughes.

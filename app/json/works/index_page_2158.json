Enter Michou (Patrick Timsit), a wandering barfly who attaches himself to Victor, both comedic and wise in the effect he has on the lives he touches and most of all on Victor and on the journey through which his sudden crisis takes him. Through their interaction with each other and those around them, brief or lasting, and the humorous antics that befall the unlikely pair, Serreau constructs a striking fairy tale with a subtle political, social and racial critique that confronts the dual existence of humanity and hypocrisy in its many forms in contemporary society.

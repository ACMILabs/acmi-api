This episode covers the history of Nelson Mandela&#8217;s imprisonment, the rise of the ANC (African National Congress) and Mandela&#8217;s eventual release. In 1961, realising that peaceful means was not bringing about change, the ANC began an armed struggle against the oppressive minority white South African government and its Apartheid system. By 1964 Mandela (an ANC leader) was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempting to cause a violent revolution and the ANC, along with the South African Communist Party, were banned, forcing many ANC leaders into exile. In the 1980s people took the liberation struggle to new heights. In the workplace, the community and in the schools, people aimed to take control of their situation. All areas of life became areas of political struggle. These struggles were linked to the demand for political power and for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela. There was also increasing anti-apartheid pressure from the outside world through sanctions, including economic sanctions, and in 1985, President PW Botha began secret talks for a peaceful resolution with Mandela (these negotiations taking place inside the prison walls). The talks would continue for four years until in 1989 Botha was replaced as President by FW De Klerk. 1989 also saw the end of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc - communism was becoming less of a threat and South Africa proclaimed the ANC &#8220;unbanned&#8221; in February 1990. With this unbanning also came Mandela&#8217;s unconditional release on 11 February 1990. Program includes interviews and commentary with Nelson Mandela, Winnie Mandela, PW Botha, FW De Klerk, Pik Botha, Kobie Coetsee (Justice Minister), Thabo Mbeki (ANC Executive), Desmond Tutu and others and features archival and newsreel footage (some parts in b&amp;w).

This episode deals with the so-called &#8220;Third Force&#8221;, an unknown force which appeared determined to destabilise and divide the ANC in order to prevent peaceful negotiations between the ANC and the National Party Government. Following Mandela&#8217;s release, South Africa erupted into even further violence as the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (and also with the support of FW De Klerk&#8217;s Government), began attacking and killing pro-ANC villages and communities. Between 1990 and 1992 these attacks by the Inkatha resulted in the death of thousands of innocent black people - the De Klerk Government claiming it was a &#8220;black on black&#8221; conflict. However the ANC leadership, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and even a few ministers in the Government, felt that there was an unknown force behind the Inkatha attacks. Allegations of police involvement, Government military training and weapons supplies to Inkatha members and a political alliance between Inkatha and the Government were put to De Klerk by Mandela but were strongly denied. Mandela resolved to unite his people and as in the 1980s, 1992 began to see the rise of people power. Strikes, rallies, demonstrations and rolling mass action over a period of weeks by the ANC and its supporters saw the Government gradually back down with its repressive law and order regime and break its ties with the Inkatha Freedom Party.

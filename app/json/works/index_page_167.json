This is an excellent example of a film work that remains true to the mood and emotional intensity of its original source text, but which also creatively re-imagines and develops the story for another medium.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Heroin habit", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jesus-son", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961271, "name": "Alliance Atlantis", "creator_id": 30788, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961272, "name": "Blue Sky Studios", "creator_id": 34323, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961273, "name": "Evenstar", "creator_id": 34324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961274, "name": "Elizabeth Cutherell", "creator_id": 79985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961275, "name": "Lydia Dean Pilcher", "creator_id": 29543, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961276, "name": "David Urrutial", "creator_id": 79986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961277, "name": "Margot Bridger", "creator_id": 79987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961278, "name": "Alison MacLean", "creator_id": 7932, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961270, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50301", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32283], "external_references": [{"id": 4558, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "25636"}]}, {"id": 86592, "acmi_id": "308280", "title": "Jerry Maguire (Captioned)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jerry-maguire-captioned", "creator_credit": "Gracie Films, James L.

The first details Jedda&#8217;s upbringing and her emotional turmoil as to her identity, which is solved by Jedda herself, when the call of her blood leads her into the physical and psychological world of her people.

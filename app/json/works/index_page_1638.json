Here Bennett&#8217;s husband is an architect who obsessively collects &#8216;felicitous rooms&#8217; in which women have been murdered, and she realizes that she must uncover the secret of one room that is always kept locked. Lang brings a precise expressionism to bear on this baroque popularization of Freudian psychoanalysis, creating an atmosphere in which the subconscious seems suspended as in a dream or a nightmare. Cast includes Joan Bennett, Michael Redgrave and Anne Revere.

The children play on the deck, reading the book “Nursery Rhyme and Pastime Book” and what appears to be a selection of Little Golden Books. A young girl knits while sitting beside her siblings and two people prepare to ski beside the lodge wearing snow gear typical to the era.</p>\n<p>The second Part of the film is titled &#8220;NEDSA 1964”. The acronym stands for North-Eastern District Ski Association which was formed by ski clubs at Falls Creek and Hotham in 1937. Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone. A podium stands at the base of the finishing line and place getters are presented with their prizes of a silver souvenir teaspoon and trophy.</p>\n<p>We see the children aboard a Snow Cat (vehicle), while others are hitched to the back on a tow rope. This section of the film shows a lovely sequence shot from the back of the vehicle showing children and a man being towed up the hill. In particular, the stylish gent wearing a Trilby or Pork Pie style hat and sunglasses cuts a fine figure on the tow rope.</p>\n<p>The third part of the film is titled “Falls Creek 1965. The Year of Parallel Skis.” In this section of the film, we can see how the family has progressed in their skiing abilities with ski lessons and participation in Slalom competition.

On the way he is joined by school friends and we see their encounters with a variety of native Australian Wildlife.  They see lace monitor tracks and follow them to where the monitor is scaling a tree. They also find a possum and an echidna.  The film shows various closeups of the animals and the children’s faces as they squint and shield their eyes from the sun.</p>\n<p>The children cross a wooden bridge where they meet an old man carrying a swag and a billy. The man gathers the children around him and reads a story to them called “The Bear”. The film then shows us the story as it is being told. It is a tale of a young girl who is very poor, very dirty and very sad. One day she finds a toy koala which brings her great joy. Excitedly she tries to show her Koala to other school children who are playing games in the school yard. They ridicule her and throw sticks at her. She runs away and falls on the grass where she drifts off to sleep. She dreams that she is rescued by a fairy Godmother who transforms her into a very clean girl in a beautiful dress! During this sequence we see good examples of Super 8 “special effects” as the fairy works her magic on the other children, transforming them into characters in fancy dress. We see these children playing circle games and closeups of their faces. Eventually the poor girl wakes up to find a kind school boy standing over her.  He helps her to her feet, takes her hand and leads her to join his other friends. Together the group skip happily all the way to school along a country road.</p>\n<p>This film shows good examples of children’s fashion, games and faces. We also see footage of houses and streets of the time.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights (timecodes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:06:00 Title card &#8216;Walking to School&#8217;<br />\n00:00:30:00 Goanna climbing tree<br />\n00:02:23:00 Echidna<br />\n00:03:45:00 Kids story time reading from &#8216;The Bear&#8217;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:11:19"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Lizards", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Marsupialia", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Tachyglossidae", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Wildlife - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Fashion - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Games", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fairy tales", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444;

Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This Penington family trip, captured on film, focuses mainly on dams visited in Victoria, Canberra and New South Wales including dams of the Kiewa Hydroelectric scheme, the Hume Dam in Albury and the old Cotter Dam in Canberra.</p>\n<p>Also shown is the Tronoh dredge in Harrietville, which was active from 1942 to 1954 and was one of the largest bucket drenches to operate in Victoria collecting 53,814 ounces of gold.</p>\n<p>There is a scene of the Clover Dam under construction and views of the town of Mount Beauty before the addition of the Mount Beauty pondage (circa 1946-1950).</p>\n<p>Of historical interest is the Gundagai Timber Rail Bridge and steam train.

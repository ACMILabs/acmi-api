Enter Michou (Patrick Timsit), a wandering barfly who attaches himself to Victor, both comedic and wise in the effect he has on the lives he touches and most of all on Victor and on the journey through which his sudden crisis takes him. Through their interaction with each other and those around them, brief or lasting, and the humorous antics that befall the unlikely pair, Serreau constructs a striking fairy tale with a subtle political, social and racial critique that confronts the dual existence of humanity and hypocrisy in its many forms in contemporary society. In French with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Political satire", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Lawyers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Housing - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Law", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political satire", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Public welfare", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social classes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social policy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social problems", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 809363, "name": "Coline Serreau", "creator_id": 33085, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q463255", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816001, "name": "Alain Sarde", "creator_id": 23743, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q712827", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809360, "name": "Les Films Alain Sarde", "creator_id": 30241, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25655135", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 809361, "name": "TFI Films", "creator_id": 23627, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036031", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49165", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [31268]}, {"id": 91774, "acmi_id": "314929", "title": "Love my dog", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "love-my-dog", "creator_credit": "Robert F.

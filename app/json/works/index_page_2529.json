Retreating, Benoit installs himself in the luxury of the Hotel George V in Paris where he is introduced to Christine (with whom he falls in love), only to discover that she is a high-class call girl. Nevertheless, Benoit, clutching at happiness, abandons his wife Francoise, to pursue a future with Christine. A comedy that examines one man&#8217;s mid-life crisis and hope for love, the film contains a fine performance from Mireille Darc as Christine.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Edouard Molinaro; writer, Francis Veber; photography, Gerard Hameline; music, Vladimir Cosma.<br />\nCast: Mireille Darc, Pierre Mondy, Michel Lonsdale, Daniel Ceccaldi, Gerald Herold, Francois Prevost.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Business ethics", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Middle classes", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889462, "name": "Gaumont International", "creator_id": 82216, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889463, "name": "Edouard Molinaro", "creator_id": 23559, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889464, "name": "Francis Veber", "creator_id": 24278, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146336", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1975", "notes": "", "to_year": "1975"}], "labels": [55187]}, {"id": 79324, "acmi_id": "300262", "title": "Le Tango stupefiant", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "le-tango-stupefiant", "creator_credit": "Ann Foreman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1987", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This is an imaginary cabaret where songs from the past unexpectedly meet.

Anila, a middle class woman living comfortably in Calcutta with her husband and young son, receives a letter from a person claiming to be her long lost uncle, and who wishes to re-establish contact with his family after travelling the world for the past 35 years. Anila&#8217;s husband, Sudhindra, suspects that the uncle may be a con-man and a thief, out to infiltrate their household in order to claim an old inheritance, and Anila is torn between this suspicion and her sense of family hospitality and obligation. A week long trial visit is agreed upon so that the true identity of Manmohan can be verified and the stranger moves into their house.

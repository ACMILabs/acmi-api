Russell Crowe gives an effective performance playing against type as Jeffrey Wigand, a paunchy middle-aged business man working for the tobacco industry who decides to blow the whistle on his colleagues&#8217; attempts to hide the health risks associated with smoking. Al Pacino is the television journalist who takes on Jeffrey&#8217;s case but who finds that his own media executives refuse to support him. Based on the true story of when a tobacco industry whistleblower approached the US &#8220;Sixty Minutes&#8221; program, &#8220;The Insider&#8221; presents a cynical and disturbing case for how the increasing corporatisation of mass media leads to a denigration of the fifth estate&#8217;s objectivity and ethics.

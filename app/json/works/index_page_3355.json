However, &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is less concerned with steamy eroticism than the aftermath of an all consuming passion, namely the devastating effect of guilt. &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is a straight forward crime of passion story in the vein of &#8216;The Postman Always Rings Twice&#8217; with the added thrill of an Asian ghost story. Adapted from a novel by Itoko Namura, &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is also known as &#8216;Phantom of Love&#8217;. Nagisa Oshima was awarded the Best Director Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1978.

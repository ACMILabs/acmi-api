Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures the visit of Australian champion golfer Peter Thomson to the Wangaratta Golf Club in 1956. As shown by the poster in the film, Thomson teaches a golf clinic to an avid crowd. At the time, Thomson had won the British Open twice, and would go on to win it a total of five times - he was the first Australian golfer to win the championship and the only man to have won it in three consecutive years in the twentieth century (1954, 1955 and 1956).</p>\n<p>The film shows off the lovely surrounds of the Golf Club set against the backdrop of the town itself and in particular, the backyards of houses.

Following the death of his wife, Colonel Benjamin Martin is content to abandon his post in the army to raise his seven children on his plantation in South Carolina. Turning his back on violence, Benjamin is stunned when his oldest son, Gabriel, leaves home and joins the fight against the British Army, despite his father&#8217;s refusal to join the Continental Army. Gabriel is injured and makes his way home to warn his family the war is getting closer. His warning is too late however, and when the English arrive, a fight breaks out on Benjamin&#8217;s plantation. When Colonel Tavington kills his son, Thomas, and captures Gabriel, Benjamin rethinks his decision not to fight. Vowing to avenge his son&#8217;s death, he rescues Gabriel and together they form a militia group, made up of Carolina patriots who will do anything to stop the British troops, and their leader Lord General Cornwallis.

Disturbed by the prevailing political and social conditions in the contemporary Japan he lead his own private army which upheld the ideals and virtues of ancient Japanese culture under the Imperial rule. He scandalised the world in 1970 when, accompanied by a few followers, he entered a military garrison in Tokyo, &#8216;captured&#8217; a general, delivered an impassioned speech to an assembly and then committed ritual suicide (seppuku) by disembowelment. Beginning with a quasi-documentary view of Mishima&#8217;s last day, Schrader offers a carefully structured examination of his public, private and literary personas, to convey key points about his personality and philosophy.

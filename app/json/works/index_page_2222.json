The working class Mr. Leonard Baste is a dreamer, imaginative and intelligent, but he is trapped by his class and the ignorance of others. Two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel (Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham-Carter) form a precarious bridge between these two men&#8217;s worlds and the result is a compelling and fascinating story about love and betrayal, privilege and poverty, a masterpiece of entertainment. Also stars Vanessa Redgrave, James Wilby and Samuel West.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/howards-end", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1987075, "name": "James Ivory", "creator_id": 22040, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51577", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987074, "name": "Ismail Merchant", "creator_id": 10058, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q732397", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987073, "name": "Merchant Ivory Productions", "creator_id": 18166, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2407366", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1987072, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39063", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [22638]}, {"id": 83153, "acmi_id": "304355", "title": "The Day the earth stood still", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-day-the-earth-stood-still", "creator_credit": "Robert Wise, Julian Blaustein and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1951", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1951-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44311, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q425992"}], "brief_description": "<p>Based on a story by Harry Bates, this tale of an invasion of earth by a single spaceship from a planet in outer space is a classic sci-fi movie from the 1950s.

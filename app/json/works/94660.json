Emanating from the ancient city of Sparta around 480 B.C., the Spartans came to be known as warriors, fierce fighters born from a ruthless militarist regime and forced to live by a strict code of discipline. Spartans wanted a perfect society, a society where equality was enforced, male homosexuality made compulsory, money was outlawed, weak children, particularly boys, were disposed of (exterminated), and women enjoyed a social and sexual freedom unheard of in the ancient world. They lived by a brutal and frugalistic system where the rite of passage for young boys verged on barbarism.

Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji), a soldier, returns from the first Chinese War and embarks on a passionate affair with Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), a woman twenty years his senior and married to a hard-drinking rickshaw man. They soon conspire to murder the husband and throw his body down a disused well. Three years later, the husband&#8217;s ghost returns to haunt the lovers, thus hastening their downfall. Like much of Oshima&#8217;s work the film is based on facts. It also follows Oshima&#8217;s defiant stance against Japan&#8217;s strict censorship laws and moral codes. However, &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is less concerned with steamy eroticism than the aftermath of an all consuming passion, namely the devastating effect of guilt. &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is a straight forward crime of passion story in the vein of &#8216;The Postman Always Rings Twice&#8217; with the added thrill of an Asian ghost story. Adapted from a novel by Itoko Namura, &#8216;Ai No Borei&#8217; is also known as &#8216;Phantom of Love&#8217;. Nagisa Oshima was awarded the Best Director Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1978.

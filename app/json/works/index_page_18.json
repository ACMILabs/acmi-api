and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This excerpt taken from the complete work on Reel 17, shows people enjoying the water and sunshine at the former State Swimming Centre (now demolished) in Batman Avenue, Melbourne. Being 1943, those enjoying the Olympic-sized pool and its facilities include soldiers in uniform as well as those displaying the various swimwear styles of the 1940s. There are sequences of diving from the high diving-boards, underwater scenes, and people sunbaking, swimming and enjoying themselves. The footage also shows glimpses of landmark buildings of Melbourne at the time, the pool and some of its surrounding seating and walkways. Three landmark Melbourne buildings in the background; St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, the Forum Theatre, and the T&amp;G Building (Temperance and General Building).</p>\n<p>The open-air Olympic Pool (formally known as the State Swimming Centre) was built by the Melbourne City Council, and opened in Batman Avenue, Melbourne in 1935.

One intelligence test attempted to determine self-awareness by seeing if the dolphins recognised themselves in a mirror.</p>\n<p>Amrita Hepi draws on that trial in &#8220;Scripture for a smokescreen: Episode 1 – dolphin house&#8221;, seemingly seducing her own image. She dances with an inflatable dolphin, attempting to communicate with it through voice and movement, paralleling the intimacy between one of the researchers, Margaret Lovatt, and a male dolphin during the experiment.</p>\n<p>Not only does Amrita lampoon the absurdity of teaching marine mammals English, she uses the study to expose the way Western knowledge systems – language, ethics and science – are imposed on people and cultures through colonisation. Through choreographed dance and moving image, Amrita explores what happens when we’re constantly under surveillance, and when assumptions about us are presented to the world through someone else’s viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Amrita Hepi is represented by Anna Schwartz Gallery</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Commissioned by ACMI and SAMSTAG</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["How I See It: Blak Art and Film&nbsp;→ Zone 2"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Two-channel video installation"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 7241}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1937464, "name": "Luke Smith", "creator_id": 87017, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1937460, "name": "Zoe Theodore", "creator_id": 87016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1937459, "name": "Amrita Hepi", "creator_id": 87015, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1937463, "name": "Daniel Jenatsch", "creator_id": 87019, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1937462, "name": "Anna Pogossova", "creator_id": 87018, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "art direction", "role_id": 920, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1937461, "name": "Luke Smith", "creator_id": 87017, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "190453", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2022", "notes": "", "to_year": "2022"}], "labels": [61311], "external_references": []}, {"id": 121994, "acmi_id": "B2005066", "title": "The Ambassador", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-ambassador", "creator_credit": "David Gallan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "video_links": [{"id": 3076, "name": "The Ambassador", "uri": "https://youtu.be/uo_DwPf4moQ"}], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2020-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;The Ambassador&#8217;, is a short film featuring veteran actor, Wynn Roberts (from Picnic At Hanging Rock) as a man who writes to the Minister for the Environment to advocate for the forests and the animals that live in them.</p>\n<p>The film is built around real events: Wynn has lived much of his 95 years in the forest.

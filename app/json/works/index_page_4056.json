The state funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901 undermines progress however, reminding the country of its ties with the old order of European dynasties. Russia too is caught firmly in the grip of autocracy, leading many Europeans to migrate to America. Mass literacy vastly changes the political awareness of ordinary citizens and newspapers bring politics to the masses in Britain and the United States. The suffragette movement is also in full swing, while the colonies work towards self government. Europe is caught up in strategic alliances, a situation which ensures world involvement should a war begin. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1914: killing fields&#8221;; Europe and Germany are drawn into a new kind of war - an industrialized war in which logistics and machine guns make a devastating and significant debut. There is the first full scale project of propaganda against the Germans, as battles at the Somme, Verdun and Ypres facilitate the slaughter of thousands of soldiers on both sides of the battle. The war ends in 1918 with an armistice and no clear victor, as well as a new distrust of public figureheads who allowed the slaughter to continue. It seems doubtful the world can return to the idyll of 1914. Narrated by Veronica Hyks. &#8220;917: red flag&#8221;; in the Soviet Union the people finally make a move to overthrown the tsar, Nicholas II, and put an end to autocratic power. An uprising, led by the Marxist socialist Lenin succeeds in overthrowing the tsar and his family. He replaces it with another system which would have international repercussion, Communism, which appealed to America during the Depression due to its productivity and opportunities for women.

Olmo is the bastard son of the peasants who work the land; Alfredo is the landowner&#8217;s child.

Olmo becomes a Communist and is involved in revolutionary politics. Alfredo finds himself drawn into fascism, even as his bohemian wife (Dominique Sanda) finds herself increasingly horrified by the excesses of the fascist thugs. Bertolucci&#8217;s vivid baroque epic dramatises the tumultuous history of modern Italy through the personal struggles of the two men. This is an epic dedicated to the European working-classes, but at the film&#8217;s centre there is a contradiction between Bertolucci&#8217;s avowed aim to make a populist epic spectacle and his intellectual and ethical commitment to dense Marxist aesthetics and polemics. If the film itself never comfortably overcomes this contradiction, lurching from intimate poetic scenes of friendship and betrayal to vulgar and vivid gothic grand guignol (in particular scenes featuring Donald Sutherland and Laura Betti as a perverse sado-masochistic fascist couple) what is undeniable are the resonances and captivating beauty of Bertolucci&#8217;s epic vision: at times it is as if he wishes to distill the essence of time, history and revolution in his mise-en-scene. What also remains unforgettable is the rich depth of the characters in this film.

This mad, confused sweeping saga finally climaxes with an imagined re-writing of history where Communism liberates forever the peasant and working classes of Italy. But for all the ludicrous impossibility and naivety of this climax, the film ends on a note of sublime transcendence. This is classic epic cinema re-imagined by a Marxist poet.

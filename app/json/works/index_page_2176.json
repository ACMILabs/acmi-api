The sharp lyrical cinematography is by Oliver Stapelton, while Irving&#8217;s script and Hallstrom&#8217;s direction is classical in structure. But though its mise-en-scene may be nostalgic, in suggesting the darker forces at play in the social order of post-World War II North America, &#8216;The Cider House rules&#8217; never allows its emotional resonances to slip into sentimentality. The cast is uniformally excellent and Michael Caine won an Academy Award for his performance.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:01:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adoption", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Abortion", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961723, "name": "Lasse Hallstrom", "creator_id": 23520, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961722, "name": "Richard Gladstein", "creator_id": 34822, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961721, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961720, "name": "Film Colony", "creator_id": 34821, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961719, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19837, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/xn7skHyWyXcvE37ZiCVD0b39XZI.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Cider House rules (Lasse Hallstrom) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1086, "height": 1591, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50664", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32638]}]}

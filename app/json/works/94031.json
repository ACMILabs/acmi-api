His time spent in Gallipoli was very brief - 2 months as a water carrier, but Alec has become part of the Anzac legend, however reluctantly, and on his passing on 16 May 2002 was given the honour of a State funeral as the last Anzac who fought in Gallipoli. This video is of the television broadcast of Alec Campbell&#8217;s State Funeral Service which was held at the Cathedral Church of Saint David in Hobart, Tasmania on Friday 24 May 2002. Hosted by Judy Tierney, Peter Gee and Lt. Col. John Moore, the program begins with a portrait of Alec Campbell&#8217;s life and achievements through interviews with his family and including stills, archival newsreel footage and family photos.

A great tribute to a man who perhaps was somewhat bewildered by all the fuss and attention he received in his final years - a gentle man.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>A State funeral for Alec Campbell: the last Anzac</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>ABC-TV (Australia), Tracey Smith and Greg Simson</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 2002</p>", "description": "<p>Described as charming, determined but also quite humble, a man of peace, widely respected and with many friends, Alec Campbell (1899-2002) was affectionately remembered as the last Anzac.

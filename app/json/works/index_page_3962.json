A charming, gentle, compassionate man, Arthur Boyd was born in 1920 in Murrumbeena, Melbourne, into a family of artists - a family who was known for its eccentricities and stern religious background. In this film we see Arthur chatting with his two young grandsons, providing them with a historical glimpse into their family background through old photographs and stories which have been passed down through the generations, along with his own personal memories of growing up in such a dynasty of &#8220;painters, potters, and dreamers&#8221;. Boyd was a figurative artist whose work focused on the human condition within the Australian landscape and although he did spend many years out of Australia in London and Europe, his works always retained the Australian spirit. Through stills, home movies, interviews, personal narratives and examples of his paintings, this program endeavours to give an overview of Boyd&#8217;s evolving journey through the decades, from his early aspirations to being an actor to finally becoming a serious painter and sculptor. We also see Boyd at work in 1993 as he prepares for a retrospective Exhibition to be held at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Arthur Boyd has left his legacy to the Australian people by bequeathing three of his properties as a gift to the nation, including the well-known &#8220;Bundanon&#8221; property which houses artists in residence, an education centre and several of Boyd&#8217;s paintings.

The binary conflicts between tradition and freedom, affluence and contentment, youth and age are reminiscent of the screwball comedies of the 1940s.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French", "Italian", "Italian", "Portuguese", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Alcohol use", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962455, "name": "Orion Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 9553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962456, "name": "Robert Greenhut", "creator_id": 46855, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962457, "name": "Steve Gordon", "creator_id": 80303, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962454, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51054", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [32989]}, {"id": 64923, "acmi_id": "000570", "title": "Arthropods: insects and their relatives", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "arthropods-insects-and-their-relatives", "creator_credit": "Coronet Instructional Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film examines the major physical characteristics which are used to identify arthropods.

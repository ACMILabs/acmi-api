Apart from the leads, the mini-series features excellent performances by Alex Dimitriades, Peter Phelps and John Hargreaves.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television - Censorship", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Biographical", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic - Investigation", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police - Australia", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police - New South Wales", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Corruption", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New South Wales - Politics and government", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815487, "name": "Rod Allan", "creator_id": 22423, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882056, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882057, "name": "AFFC", "creator_id": 24545, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882058, "name": "Southern Star Entertainment", "creator_id": 26294, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 882060, "name": "Michael Jenkins", "creator_id": 68594, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16107356", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 882055, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50526", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [32509], "external_references": []}, {"id": 85347, "acmi_id": "306734", "title": "Blue Mountains: moving memories: 1920's - 1970's", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blue-mountains-moving-memories-1920s-1970s", "creator_credit": "National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1996", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The National Film and Sound Archive has assembled a superb compilation of historic footage which follows the growth and development of the Blue Mountains, one of the most spectacular natural features of the Australian continent.

Russian immigrant Tanya (Dina Korzun) arrives at Gatwick airport with her ten year old son Artiom (Artiom Strelinikov) to be reunited with her British fiance. When he doesn&#8217;t arrive the distressed Tanya rashly decides to claim political asylum in order to stay in the country. She is then taken to a refuge holding center situated in an abandoned holiday resort where she virtually becomes a prisoner. While detained she meets amusement arcade manager Alfie (Paddy Considine) an ex-crim who takes Tanya and her son under his wings. Soon enough an unlikely romance develops between the pair. Director Pawel Pawlikowski handles his material delicately eliciting some wonderful naturalistic performances from his leads. While cinematographer Ryszard Lenczewski adds to the melancholy nature of the film by giving the look of the once thriving fun park an eerie beauty. Cast includes Lindsey Honey, Dave Bean, Katie Drinkwater.

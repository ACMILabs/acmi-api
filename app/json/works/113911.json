The oil bottle still has 3 mm of oil at bottom which is fluid.  The cork lid of the bottle also has a tiny metal straw protruding from it to gather the oil.\n - Singer (brand) oil pourer with a removable nozzle.  Not from this set, but owner must have used it as one of many methods to oil the projector.\n - Tiny metal funnel for pouring oil into oil dropper.\n - One glass dropper with rubber end which is stored inside a cylindrical tube with lid.\n - One clear plastic dropper with remnants of oil inside top round squeezer.\n - Australian plug with nothing connected.\n - A small Euro plug which is backed on to wood and slots in the back of the machine.\n - An old paper rag\n - 2 spare belts in very delicate wax paper bags.

    "brief_description": "<p>On March 23, the sight of a container ship lodged inside the Suez Canal like a car abandoned during a bad parallel park enthralled the world. But the traffic the Ever Given blocked wasn’t insignificant, with hundreds of other vessels barred from delivering supplies and the stock market affected. A catastrophe yes, but one that flooded the internet with hilarious memes, like this one from Zaina Erhaim, which married the logistical absurdity with an equally absurd and iconic scene from Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery.</p>",

High above the cliffs of the English coast, another form of chaos ensues as the inmates of Dr. Seward&#8217;s asylum react badly to the storm, while his daughter Lucy&#8217;s companion, Mina Van Helsing, is lured from her sick-bed to rescue the only survivor of the shipwreck. The charming but enigmatic Count Dracula quickly ingratiates himself into Seward&#8217;s home, and spellbinds Mina, who is soon found dead under bizarre circumstances. Overwhelmed by guilt, Seward contacts Mina&#8217;s father, Professor Van Helsing, who promptly appears to investigate the cause of his daughter&#8217;s death, only to discover the true identity of their beguiling guest. However, the Count has already set his sights on Lucy, and Van Helsing and Lucy&#8217;s bewildered fiance Jonathon Harker must confront the demon interloper if they are to save her from a fate worse than death. Frank Langella stars as Dracula (a role reprised from the stage adaptation), with Sir Laurence Olivier as Van Helsing, Donald Pleasence as Dr. Seward, and Kate Nelligan as Lucy.

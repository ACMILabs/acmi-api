The illustration is by a young film artist and animator who sees life with an amused and imaginative eye. His take-off point is the music, but his own beat is more boisterous than the musicians. He ranges from the most convoluted of abstractions to caricature of familiar rituals, including the bath. Photography by Pierre Provost, Cameron Gaul, Simon Leblanc. Music by Rick Scott, Dick Tarnoff, Rick Stone, Rick Watson, Jim Colby and Jon Van Arsdell. Sound by Roland Newton.

Directed by Doug Liman (Go, The Bourne Identity), this film catapulted into the spotlight actors Jon Favreau (who also wrote the screenplay) and Vince Vaughn. Mike (Favreau), an out of work actor and comedian, is lovesick for his long-term girlfriend who he hasn&#8217;t heard from in six months. Buoyed in his misery by friends Trent, Rob and Sue, Mike is taken to a slew of groovy LA bars and parties in the hope that he&#8217;ll meet a babe and be jolted out of his despair. Trent (Vaughn) is Mike&#8217;s most confident and smooth talking friend, a sartorial charmer who has a way with the ladies and is constantly on the make. Mike struggles with the convoluted courtship rules, whilst battling his extensive self-doubts and self-consciousness. &#8220;Swingers&#8221; works as a sharp satire of the LA scene where bit actors scrape by on the glory of call-backs for pilots and former glories are regurgitated in the hope of getting lucky in love.

The original screenplay (by director Kenneth Lonergan) veers away from cliche and pat conclusions, imbuing the characters with a realistic quality. Sammy and Terry are orphaned at a young age when their parents are killed in a car accident. As adults, the siblings are estranged, having made divergent choices. Sammy is a single parent with an eight-year-old son, Rudy, living in the house she was brought up in, working in a bank. She lives by a strict moral code, bound by religion and duty, but is entirely capable of hypocrisy and self-delusion. Terry, by contrast, is a wild loner, full of rage, self-destructive by nature but charming in his own humorous way. He doesn&#8217;t believe in Sammy&#8217;s ordered conservative life and inadvertently challenges this, creating chaos with his presence. It is Terry and Rudy&#8217;s strengthening relationship that acts as a catalyst, causing an irrevocable torrent of truths that upend the family dynamics. The personal and familial dilemmas contained within the script are identifiable and the film sensitively deals with themes of oppression and personal choice. Cast includes: Laura Linney, Matthew Broderick, Mark Ruffalo, Rory Culkin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Single parents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family reunions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Responsibility"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/you-can-count-on-me", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2270708, "name": "Kenneth Lonergan", "creator_id": 85658, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q968840", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2270690, "name": "Barbara de Fina", "creator_id": 23666, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121078968", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2270692, "name": "Jeffrey Sharp", "creator_id": 80077, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6176278", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2270702, "name": "John N.

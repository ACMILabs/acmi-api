Filmed in stunning locations in the Africa, Asia and the Middle East, &#8220;Arabian Nights&#8221; consists of tales within tales, a weaving of fairy stories all connected by their illustration of the intrinsic power of the human search for love and sex.

When they are separated by the evil machinations of a slave dealer, Aziz begins a search for his lost love.

Set amongst some of the most spectacular architectural monuments and cityscapes of the Islamic and Buddhist world, the film is a continuous feast for all the senses.

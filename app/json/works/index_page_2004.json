Enjoying a cult following, the program produced by Irish art critic and London gallery director, Andrew MacKenzie along with co-presenter Lena Corner, roams the streets of Melbourne in search of opening nights and visual vox pops. The program&#8217;s style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Lena Corner interviews Sue Wyers in her studio and talks about the &#8216;honoured object&#8217; and &#8216;domains of defiance&#8217;, themes related to Wyers&#8217; work. Rod Quantock is the talking head at Span Galleries opening of the &#8216;Artful Dodgers&#8217; revealing the Xena photographs as his favourite. RMIT gallery opens its retrospective of internationally renowned German artist, Gerhard Richter. The exhibition surveys forty years of Richter&#8217;s work using examples that identify &#8216;touchstones&#8217; for the artist as selected by Richter himself. The works explore the fluid line between the abstract and figurative and use process both as a means and an end. The exhibition at Westspace Gating&#8221; is a group show exploring sound technologies. Featured are the works by Michael Graeve, Simon Kilvert (Decent Column), Rhino Lintz and Mark [Marco] Fusinato (2&#8217; 30&#8221;).

Part 2 of the program features the work of two video artists Dominic Redfern and Daniel Von Sturmer. Introduced by Mackenzie (who provides an entertaining &#8216;history of video conventions&#8217; in less than 1 minute) are excerpts from Redfern&#8217;s &#8216;Non/un&#8217; and &#8216;There&#8217;s this guy&#8230;&#8217; that are concerned with exploring the use of screen surface and space and movement, time and space. Von Sturmer&#8217;s work reconstructs the &#8220;white cube&#8221; to sit within the video frame where he places ordinary objects in order to explore their physical properties, whilst exporting experimental studio processes into video work. The outcome is a surprising observation of the malleability of space and time within the video frame.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Themes, motives", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art appreciation", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art criticism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art galleries", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, European", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists and community", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Community art projects", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Conceptual art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Modernism (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233725, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233724, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115599, "acmi_id": "S01440", "title": "Public hangings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "public-hangings", "creator_credit": "Andrew MacKenzie", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93887, "acmi_id": "317641", "title": "Public hangings.

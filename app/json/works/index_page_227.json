Each character, filled with anticipation (and some with fear), discusses their new role as mother, reflecting upon their pasts, revealing key moments that lead them to this point. Sayles also devotes some narrative time to the story of a young impoverished boy and his depressing milieu, a pregnant teenager and her overbearing mother, a cleaning woman raising her siblings and a hotel manager and her errant son. Multiple story threads dilutes the emotional impact, but fine acting and some sticky social issues provide the film with occasional potency.<br />\nCast includes: Daryl Hannah, Lili Taylor, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary Steenburgen</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Latin America", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ South America", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture conflict", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Poverty - Children", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social problems", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ South America - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adoption", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women", "Places&nbsp;→ Latin America", "Places&nbsp;→ South America"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2000399, "name": "John Sayles", "creator_id": 23691, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2141212", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000398, "name": "Lemore Syvan", "creator_id": 81153, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000397, "name": "Alejandro Springall", "creator_id": 81152, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4714680", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000396, "name": "Syvan", "creator_id": 37193, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000395, "name": "Springall Pictures", "creator_id": 37192, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000394, "name": "Blue Magic Pictures", "creator_id": 37191, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2000393, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53122", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [34566], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95059, "acmi_id": "319104", "title": "Go now", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "go-now-dvd", "creator_credit": "Michael Winterbottom, David M.

Cohan, born on the 4th of July, became one of Broadway&#8217;s legendary composers. Cohan&#8217;s prolific career spanned 55 years where he wrote 35 plays and 500 songs including &#8220;Harrigan&#8221;, &#8220;Give my regards to Broadway&#8221;, and of course &#8220;Yankee Doodle Dandy.&#8221; This is an exuberant song and dance production starring James Cagney, with his typical flair, in the title role. This film premiered in 1942 and was a salute to American patriotism and the &#8216;Grand old flag&#8217;, yet time has not dulled its freshness and energy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:01:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953003, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953004, "name": "William Cagney", "creator_id": 26624, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953005, "name": "Michael Curtiz", "creator_id": 1714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953002, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

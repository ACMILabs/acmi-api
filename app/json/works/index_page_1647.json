It is not long, however, before Catherine discovers that her dearly betrothed is both unfaithful and madly insane and yet for all this, she remains devoted and true to him. But with the death of Empress Elisabeth, and Peter&#8217;s ascension to the throne, life becomes more unpredictable and precarious for Catherine as Peter&#8217;s mental health and behaviour becomes more unstable. Circumstances take control and eventually Catherine is forced to assume power. This is an interesting piece of filming for its time and the quality acting and lavish sets certainly add to its depth. Cast also includes Gerald Du Maurier, Irene Vanbrugh, Diana Napier. NB: Filmed in black and white, the visual quality is quite dark in some scenes and the soundtrack is scratchy but still worth viewing.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Catherine II, Empress of Russia, 1729-1796", "History&nbsp;→ Monarchy, Russian", "History&nbsp;→ Russia - History", "People&nbsp;→ Catherine II, Empress of Russia, 1729-1796"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964366, "name": "London Film Productions", "creator_id": 14653, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964367, "name": "Korda-Toeplitz Productions", "creator_id": 36743, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964368, "name": "Alexander Korda", "creator_id": 14654, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964369, "name": "Ludovico Toeplitz", "creator_id": 80143, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964370, "name": "Paul Czinner", "creator_id": 24539, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52682", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1934", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1934"}], "labels": [34162]}, {"id": 72245, "acmi_id": "322685", "title": "The Rise of big business", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-rise-of-big-business", "creator_credit": "Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and Kenneth Vose", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1969", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Through a study of the values, aspirations and achievements of Andrew Carnegie, John D.

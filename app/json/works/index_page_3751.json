Through a philanthropic enterprise he continued to fund development projects for the Nepalese people - projects that the people themselves requested. His legacy will live on through the children of Nepal attending one of the some 30 schools that his &#8220;Himalayan Trust&#8221; built since 1961 - in many cases by his own hands. This DVD contains two documentaries - one made in 1980 is about Sir Edmund at sixty years of age and the other made in 2000 continues the subject matter of his philanthropic work - the DVD release commemorates the 50th Anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary&#8217;s ascent of Mount Everest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Social life and customs", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Charities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community and school", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School buildings", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Mountaineering", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Bridges", "People&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Places&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Places&nbsp;→ Nepal"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 929457, "name": "Michael Dillon Film Enterprises", "creator_id": 20465, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929458, "name": "Dick Smith Adventure", "creator_id": 20436, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929459, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 929460, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 929456, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52935", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34390]}, {"id": 87449, "acmi_id": "309389", "title": "Beyond El Rocco", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "beyond-el-rocco", "creator_credit": "Lucas Produkzions, AFFC and Kevin Lucas", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1989", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;Beyond El Rocco&#8217; is an affectionate look at the Australian jazz scene and its evolution through the decades from the swinging 60s through to the experimentalism of the 80s.

An heir to the transcendent cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky, Sokurov&#8217;s body of work forms a rich examination of Russian history and culture, imbued with a spiritual and ethical commitment to the European humanist literary tradition.</p>\n<p>&#8216;Spiritual Voices&#8217; was shot with video equipment over an 18-month period in which Sokurov accompanied a young army platoon during harsh and dangerous patrols along the battle lines of the USSR&#8217;s war with Afghanistan. Absorbing the gestures and emotions of the homesick young soldiers, Sokurov developed a deep understanding of squadron life. Accordingly, &#8216;Spiritual Voices&#8217; is free of the usual cinematic bombast concerning war: there is no tightly structured dramatic conflict between good and evil, no diverting spectacles, no individual heroism leading the viewer through a fable of personal and national triumph.</p>\n<p>The five parts of &#8216;Spiritual Voices&#8217; were originally intended to be shown as a serial spanning several sessions for television or cinema. But Sokurov has permitted ACMI to install the work with all five channels playing simultaneously. Viewed in this extraordinarily rich configuration, &#8216;Spiritual Voices&#8217; vividly captures the mysteriously patterned, non-linear experience of war.</p>\n<p>As viewers scan the five screens trying to take in all the information that is assailing them, they piece together an appropriately discontinuous impression of war.

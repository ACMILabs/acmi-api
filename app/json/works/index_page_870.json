Hughes - a passionate supporter of the Australian Republican Movement, and former Prime Minister Bob Hawke lend their orative skills to the debate. Hughes talks of the town of Elizabeth in South Australia, so named after Queen Elizabeth II. He also touches on Monarchists roots in Adelaide, political persuasions from Menzies to Whitlam, and the popularity of RSL clubs. He speaks to former Prime Minister Paul Keating about the future of the Republican movement, and World War One digger Ted Smout on his thoughts on the issue. Hughes touches briefly on the design of Parliament House, Maralinga, visits Sydney&#8217;s Hyde Park, and talks of Asian enterprise on the Gold Coast.

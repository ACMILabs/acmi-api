Some solutions might not rate in terms of human prosperity, but will drastically improve the environment. Alternatively, some solutions will benefit humans, but impact negatively on our surroundings. Your mission is to find a logical balance between profit and preservation before it&#8217;s too late. Beautiful graphics, easy to install and very user-friendly.

Jamie also finds time to drop in on friends with a variety of backgrounds and budgets, in Coventry, Manchester and London and creates a range of dishes including: slow-roasted leg of pork with spicy scratching; sticky chocolate sauce pudding; celeriac and potato gratin; tray baked field mushrooms with garlic, butter and thyme; apricot and pistachio tarte tatin; sea bass with fennel and olives; white risotto with lemon thyme, sliced prosciutto, pecorino, parmesan and crumbled goats cheese.

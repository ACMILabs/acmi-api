Without any hesitation, Ismael proceeds to cold-bloodedly kill the woman and only as he makes his escape does he realise that the murder has been silently witnessed by the woman&#8217;s young daughter, Leire. Many years later Leire (Ana Alvarez) and Ismael&#8217;s paths cross. Terrified that he may be exposed by the truth, Ismael decides to kidnap Leire and hold her prisoner in his derelict squat, much to his girlfriend Maite&#8217;s (Lio) annoyance and frustration.

A film of suspense and intrigue peppered with moments of dark humour and acted by a superb cast including Silvia Marso, Elena Irureta, Ramon Barea.

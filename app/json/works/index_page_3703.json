Bonnie decided to go home to America to talk to family and friends about September 11 and whether it has changed their feelings about America and being American. Through her interviews with members of her family (Black American, middle-class), her priest, university students, friends and co-workers from the past, Bonnie discovered that if Americans were arrogant, it was an arrogance born out of ignorance and that since September 11, many Americans were beginning to do some soul-searching and treating the terrorist attack as a wake-up call.

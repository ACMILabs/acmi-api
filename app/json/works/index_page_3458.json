Throughout the 20th century, the motion picture camera has recorded these changes, creating a permanent, living record of our past. This program has been compiled from Cinesound and Movietone Newsreel items, as well as advertising films from the 1930s to the 1960s. As you watch this video, some of the stories will make you laugh, others you may find distasteful, a few will seem absurd, but most of them are certain to make you cringe. NOTE: Some of the footage in this video may contain material of a sexist or racist nature.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Racism - Australia", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - Australia", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Attitude change", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Attitude change", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Attitude change", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 793362, "name": "National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "creator_id": 10175, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121314986", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 793361, "name": "ScreenSound Australia", "creator_id": 16130, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2565882", "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42736", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [25999]}, {"id": 72876, "acmi_id": "009876", "title": "Skeleton weed", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "skeleton-weed", "creator_credit": "New South Wales.

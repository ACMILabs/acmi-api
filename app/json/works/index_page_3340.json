In posing these questions the program includes the scientific reason behind processes and provides a clear, entertaining and useful tool suited to secondary level science students.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Food - Composition", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 12+", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cookery (Natural foods)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Food - Analysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Food - Composition", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Food - Analysis", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Food - Composition", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 239607, "name": "Learning Seed", "creator_id": 23906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 239608, "name": "Stage Fright Productions Geneva, Il", "creator_id": 30731, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45687", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [28222]}, {"id": 89854, "acmi_id": "312736", "title": "Food safety guidelines for community food events", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "food-safety-guidelines-for-community-food-events", "creator_credit": "Victoria.

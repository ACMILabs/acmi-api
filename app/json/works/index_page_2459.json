Included are letters from the front, and strangely, a faded red handkerchief filled with soil. The story jumps back to 1936, when young Dave, a communist, decides he will fight the fascists in Spain. When he joins the Republican workers fighting fascist soldiers in the Barcelona foothills, he finds not only a new purpose in life, but also first love, and eventually political disillusionment. Mainly in English, with sections in Spanish, German, French with sub-titles. Multi-award wining film (Cannes, Euopean Film of the Year) directed by Ken Loach.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Spain - History - Civil War, 1936-1939", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Spain - History - Civil War, 1936-1939", "Places&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/land-and-freedom", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1990819, "name": "Ken Loach", "creator_id": 72757, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55238", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990818, "name": "Rebecca O'Brien", "creator_id": 28484, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2134946", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990816, "name": "Messidor Films", "creator_id": 28482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990815, "name": "Parallax Films", "creator_id": 28481, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990817, "name": "Road Movies Dritte Produktionen", "creator_id": 28483, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42649", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [25918]}]}

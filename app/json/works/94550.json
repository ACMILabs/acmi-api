It is a story of love and tragedy, of an Aboriginal community living and working harmoniously with white people in the timber industry in the forest area of Jackson&#8217;s Track established by Daryl and his brother Harry during the 1930s. It tells of Daryl&#8217;s feud with his family when he decided to live with an Aboriginal woman, the dramatic kidnapping of this woman by his brother, Daryl&#8217;s life with the Aboriginal community and the eventual bull-dozing of the camp in the 1960s to appease local Christian groups resulting in the break-up and dispersal of the almost 100 people living at the camp. Daryl talks of himself as being at one with the Aboriginal way of life, a true bushman, who saw his life neither primitive nor of poverty and hardship, but as being his preferred way of life.

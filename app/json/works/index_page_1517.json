Highlights include combat footage of the Spanish Civil War, the coronation of King George VI in 1937, spectacular mass rallies in Germany and the Soviet Union and the images of the devastation of the Blitz in Great Britain.<br />\n2. &#8216;Total War&#8217; Focuses on the period when the war reached a new, global intensity, beginning with the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and ending in the Summer of 1944 with US Marines fighting bloody battles with the Japanese in the Pacific.<br />\n3. &#8216;Triumph and despair&#8217; The experiences of British, American and Canadian soldiers, who made the historic crossing of the Channel, and who fought through The Battle of the Hedgerows to liberate Northern France, are heard through their letters and diaries. The fears and emotions expressed by American, French and Japanese soldiers and Japanese and German civilians are accompanied by footage of the fall of Berlin, the Battle of Okinawa, Kamikaze attacks and the devastation of the Atom bomb. This volume concludes with footage of the release of POWs, refugees and displaced people and reflects on the legacy of a war which cost 50 million lives.</p>\n<p>Also available on VHS [313552], [313553], and [313554].</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Home movies and video", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - United States", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Atomic bomb - Blast effect", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Battles", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Pearl Harbor (Hawaii), Attack on, 1941", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Soldiers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Spain - History - Civil War, 1936-1939", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Biography", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Canada", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Displaced persons", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - France", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Germany", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Great Britain", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Japan", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Pacific Area", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Propaganda", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Soviet Union", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ideology", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political science", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Refugees", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Coronations", "History&nbsp;→ George VI, King of Great Britain, 1895-1952", "History&nbsp;→ Refugees", "History&nbsp;→ Spain - History - Civil War, 1936-1939", "History&nbsp;→ Warsaw (Poland) - History - Warsaw Ghetto Uprisings, 1943", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - History", "People&nbsp;→ George VI, King of Great Britain, 1895-1952", "People&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2141549, "name": "Alastair Laurence", "creator_id": 81077, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2141545, "name": "Lucy Carter", "creator_id": 81076, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2141542, "name": "Transworld International", "creator_id": 19136, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2141541, "name": "Carlton Television", "creator_id": 58875, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2141537, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

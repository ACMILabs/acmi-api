A curious blend of science fiction and medieval iconography, &#8220;Krull&#8221; has all the resident tenets of a fantasy; damsel in distress, love that can cure all evil, an almighty quest and final showdown between hero and villain. Whilst receiving a G classification, there are a few ghoulish moments which belie the general rating. Made on a budget in excess of 45 million, the film received cult rather than commercial success.

Based on Giorgio Bassini&#8217;s acclaimed novel of the same name, the film details the experiences of love, family and politics as seen through the eyes of the adults and the adolescents in the Finzi-Contini family. The children attempt to make their mansion a refuge against fascism, a perpetual romantic space to re-live their childhood games and preoccupations. The adults, in turn, hope that by accommodating to the increasingly humiliating &#8220;race-laws&#8221; they will buy time and live to see the restoration of the old social order. But as Italy joins Germany in war, all their attempts prove futile against the savage anti-Semitism of fascism. In the film&#8217;s devastating concluding passage, the tragedy of European twentieth-century history is conveyed in the stark faces of the family, stripped of their luxuries and belongings; stripped of their illusions and their hope. The film is a loving remembrance of a specifically Italian Jewish history and culture: de Sica&#8217;s ability to immerse us in the textures and colours of a vanquished past is one of this film&#8217;s greatest achievements.

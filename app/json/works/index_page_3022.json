Describes in dramatised form the story of an unmarried mother. Free assistance includes pre-natal attention and classes in the care of children. Following the birth of her child in hospital in Copenhagen the mother spends some time at a Mother&#8217;s Aid home, where she receives instruction in homecrafts and is trained to earn a living. Also reveals that since 1888, fathers have been required by Danish law to financially support their children until the age of 18.

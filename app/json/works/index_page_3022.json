Finding herself in an orphanage when the revolution forces her family into exile, Anastasia grows into a young woman called Anya with little memory of her past. Years later while in St Petersburg with her puppy, she meets a handsome man called Dimitri who takes her to Paris to reclaim her status as a Romanov. Anastasia and Dimitri have an instant affinity - having met years before, only neither of them remembers. Their journey to reach Paris and solve one of the greatest mysteries of the twentieth century is impeded by the evil monk Rasputin and his sidekick Bartok the bat. Fortunately there are plenty of lively songs and voice characterisation by prominent Hollywood stars to dispel any frightening outcomes. Voices are provided by Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Hank Azaria, Christopher Lloyd and Angela Lansbury. Anastasia&#8217;s songs are performed by Liz Callaway.

When Eugenio is ten years old his father sends a friend to collect him but believing the boy will only cause trouble, and irritated by his behaviour, the friend abandons the boy on a deserted road. The father is horrified and sets out to find him. Eventually after many adventures on his own, he is found and taken home, but the affection showered on him by his family is short-lived and he runs away, his departure going unnoticed by those around him. Luigi Comencini made his first feature film in 1948 and was an advocate of the Neorealist movement. However he tempered his realist approach with solid commercialism. His best (and most profitable) films include the Gina Lollobrigida showcase &#8216;Bread, Love and Dreams&#8217; (1953) and its sequels. In 1987, Comencini was the recipient of a Career Achievement award from the Venice Festival.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, writer, Luigi Comencini.<br />\nCast: Saverio Marconi, Dalila di Lazzaro, Meme Prlini, Francesco Bonelli, Carole Andre, Bernard Blier</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Abandoned children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Abandoned children", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889323, "name": "Luigi Comencini", "creator_id": 78252, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q53015", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889322, "name": "Intercontinental", "creator_id": 82171, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337242", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889320, "name": "Les Films du Losange", "creator_id": 23079, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889321, "name": "Moonfleet", "creator_id": 82170, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315712", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film;

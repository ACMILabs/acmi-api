Whatever the disasters in her lovelife, she compensates with a rich fantasy life in which she dreams of meeting a man who will take her away from the sleazy world of the dancehalls. Based on a stage musical scripted by Neil Simon, which in turn was based on Federico Fellini&#8217;s &#8220;Nights of Cabiria.&#8221; &#8220;Sweet Charity&#8221; is a highly enjoyable screen musical which points to the new direction the musical film was to take in the &#8216;70&#8217;s. Fosse maintains the Broadway plot but he choreographs a stunning series of dance routines around the songs &#8220;Big Spender&#8221;, &#8220;There&#8217;s Got to be Something Better than This&#8221;, &#8220;If My Friends Could See Me Now&#8221; and a wonderfully hippie version of &#8220;Rhythm of Life&#8221; sung by a New Age minister played by Sammy Davis Jr. In &#8220;Sweet Charity&#8221; Bob Fosse is beginning the experimentation with dance and music which was to lead to his groundbreaking work in &#8220;Cabaret.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2320305, "name": "Bob Fosse", "creator_id": 4471, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q313256", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2320301, "name": "Robert Arthur", "creator_id": 77807, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7341609", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2320300, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2320296, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41036", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [24548]}, {"id": 85057, "acmi_id": "306421", "title": "Cheyenne autumn", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "cheyenne-autumn", "creator_credit": "John Ford, Bernard Smith and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1964", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47720, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1071402"}], "brief_description": "<p>This is the last and perhaps best Western directed by John Ford, featuring a stellar cast including Richard Widmark, Karl Malden, Sal Mineo, Edward G.

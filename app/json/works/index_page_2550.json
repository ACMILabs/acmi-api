Full of energy, the script, performances, sets, locations and costume design are excellent, while the overall production veers away from the formality of previous adaptations. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are Darcy and Elizabeth and they are joined by a large and well-known cast including Barbara Leigh Hunt, Alison Steadman, Julia Sawalha and Susannah Harker.

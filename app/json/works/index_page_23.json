Speakers include working girls, homeless, welfare workers, and aboriginal residents. While the technical quality is not great, vision and sound are clear.<br />\nAt first the viewer is not sure where the journey is going, and whether the speakers&#8217; words will be enough to hold our attention given the relative lack of visual stimulation. However as the program continues we are drawn in and held by the honesty, openness and truth of what we hear. The exterior interview locations grow on the viewer as markers of place. We realise that these uneducated or unsophisticated voices are saying important and meaningful things about community, change, class and status, and how regional social change affects the individual. By the close, one likes and believes in these &#8216;ordinary people&#8217;, and learns the value of community voices irrespective of their apparent form.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:34:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians", "Documentary", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcohol", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White", "Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1430423, "name": "SKA TV", "creator_id": 7339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1430422, "name": "SKA TV", "creator_id": 7339, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430421, "name": "Belinda Smith", "creator_id": 81892, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430420, "name": "Warren Ingram", "creator_id": 81891, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430419, "name": "Simon Boyle", "creator_id": 81890, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430418, "name": "Jessie Watson", "creator_id": 81889, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430417, "name": "Andrea Foxworthy", "creator_id": 81216, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430416, "name": "Yael Zalchandler", "creator_id": 81888, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1430415, "name": "Rachel Maher", "creator_id": 81887, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "collaborator", "role_id": 536, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-2 Digital File; Memory Grid Pod Full Encode", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2119", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [53621]}, {"id": 114126, "acmi_id": "B1005266", "title": "Kombi Karma", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kombi-karma", "creator_credit": "Janine Harrison and Charles Coates", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2003", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Kombi Karma examines a cultural icon through the eyes of a diverse group of VW Kombi van lovers.

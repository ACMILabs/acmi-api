We also see Ronald Gadsden tending soil in the garden with a small (cutlery) fork.<br />\n00:13:39:00 several shots of Ronald tossing a shotput in what appears to be a competition or practice for a competition.<br />\n00:14:02:00 Ronald and others climbing a lookout quickly followed by Jess looking very confident happy on horseback and then Ronald riding a horse as well. This could be at their farm at Lancefield in regional Victoria.<br />\n00:14:41:00 family tennis court, filmed in colour (same court as earlier in black and white) where we see Jess and Ronald play with other family members.<br />\n00:16:31:00 the camera is back at the beach, in colour with Ronald a little older dabbling his toe in the water for the camera.<br />\n00:17:18:00 scenes in black and white showing Jess and Ronald&#8217;s son Geoffrey, riding on a miniature train in a park.<br />\n00:18:05:00 Gadsden children in black and white sequence, playing under the garden hose.<br />\n00:18:34:00 Ronald and son are riding an elephant presumably at the zoo and then son Geoffrey playing on playground equipment.<br />\n00:19:32:00 steam trains and &#8216;red rattler&#8217; commuter trains with young Geoffrey looking on from a walkbridge.<br />\n00:20:50:00 night time scenes of the city&#8217;s neon signs in order to capture the decorations installed for the royal visit in 1954.<br />\n00:21:47:00 motorcade for the visiting royals.<br />\n00:24:18:00 crowds watching the royal motorcade and in particular a quick clear shot of the Queen in an open car. Of note also is the number of ladders and kitchen stools brought along by members often crowd to gain vantage points.<br />\n00:24:22:00 opening of the Olympic Games in Melbourne 1956, including Ron Clarke running along the stadium track with the Torch as well as the assembled countries and flags and the Olympic flag.<br />\n00:28:40:00 snow slopes and skiers appear and we see a series of shots including Jess Gadsden and some older women of the family walking and posing in front of what could be their holiday house.<br />\n00:31:00:00 an interior shot of what might be a country holiday house near the snow or a chalet with family members chatting.<br />\n00:31:13:00 an older member of the family playing with young children on the family tennis court which is now unmarked.<br />\n00:33:35:00 members of the extended family gather with all of their children for a family occasion. At one point, the children all parade past the camera in single file.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:35:35:00"]}, {"label": "Subject

Of particular note are the opening sequences of the reel which show Kenneth&#8217;s interest in devising creative and clever titles.

Kenneth also uses his artistic sub-titles to separate sequences in the reel as well as his lingering shots of flowers (a device which he used regularly throughout his films). Highlights of the reel include the 1940s style of wedding and the wedding fashions of the era. Scenes at the wedding reception show some of the customs of day such as drinking an obligatory glass of sherry (usually upon arrival) and hosting the reception in the family home.

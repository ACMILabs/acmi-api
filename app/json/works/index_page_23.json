He falls under the influence of a morbid young friend who is a member of a secret circle of sadistic schoolboys who follow a moral code that leads them to torture and dissect what they consider to be &#8220;imperfect.&#8221; Initially, they only inflict their bloody justice on animals but the &#8220;charges&#8221; against persons are mounting, and the shcoolboys code must be obeyed. Passionate love scenes and a bizzare ending highlight this unusual film, beautifully shot by Douglas Slocombe on English sea coast locations with music composed by John Mandel.

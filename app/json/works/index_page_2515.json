A splendid remake of Howard Hawks&#8217; 1930 Oscar winner, this film aptly captures the pervading tone of wartime camaraderie and the gruelling pressures of battlefront command, and remains at the top of Hollywood&#8217;s finest aviation epics.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-dawn-patrol", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2342101, "name": "Edmund Goulding", "creator_id": 5335, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q263022", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2342099, "name": "Turner Entertainment", "creator_id": 25534, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q371400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2342097, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2342095, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39426", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [22992]}, {"id": 83499, "acmi_id": "304738", "title": "Picnic", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "picnic", "creator_credit": "Joshua Logan, Fred Kohlmar and Columbia Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1955", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1955-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45638, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1300420"}], "brief_description": "<p>Based on William Inge&#8217;s Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway hit, &#8220;Picnic&#8221; is a revealing look into the hearts and minds of a select group of Kansas townfolk over Labor Day weekend.

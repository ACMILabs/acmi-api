Her prayers are answered, a miracle occurs and the handsome and mysterious Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail, appears, heralded by a white swan, wearing a silver coat of mail, shining helmet and carrying a golden horn. He agrees to champion her on the condition that she never asks his country, name or rank but trusts in his abilities and his love for her. A magnificent marriage ceremony follows which includes the traditional bridal march which is still heard in many weddings. However, Elsa&#8217;s inability to trust in her champion leads to the inevitable and tragic end of this epic love story.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Herzog, Werner, 1942-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Wagner, Richard, 1813-1883", "People&nbsp;→ Wagner, Richard, 1813-1883", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Opera  -  Performance", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 782846, "name": "Brian Large", "creator_id": 15897, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q912486", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 782845, "name": "Unitel", "creator_id": 21610, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223158", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 782844, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 782847, "name": "Werner Herzog", "creator_id": 4161, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q44131", "role": "project director", "role_id": 494, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39547", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [23110]}]}

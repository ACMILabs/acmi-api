There has been speculation surrounding his literary counterparts as possible sources for the text - Bacon, Freud, Twain - however Marlowe emerged as the main contender. Rubbo examines the Marlowe establishment - the appreciation society, critics, and most significantly, the actions of Calvin Hoffman, who, in 1984 exhumed a tomb in the belief that it contained a box of papers that would discredit Shakespeare. He also set a literary challenge for anyone to find proof of Marlowe as the true author with a monetary reward as incentive.

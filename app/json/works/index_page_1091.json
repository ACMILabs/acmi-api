Broomfield&#8217;s documentary is in no way objective, but it is fascinating to watch, as the director pointedly incorporates his own battle to get his film made with Courtney Love vehemently attempting to stop the film. With home footage of Cobain and interviews with people who knew Cobain and Love, this is a must see for Nirvana fans (although due to legal constraints Broomfield could not use any music by Nirvana in the film). Curiously Kurt remains a shadowy figure in the film, and you actually get a stronger sense of Courtney Love as well as the various &#8216;hangers on&#8217; who Broomfield interviews throughout the film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Conspiracy", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Conspiracy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Grunge music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "People&nbsp;→ Cobain, Kurt", "People&nbsp;→ Love, Courtney, 1965-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427779, "name": "Nicholas Broomfield", "creator_id": 20645, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427778, "name": "Capitol Films", "creator_id": 29576, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427777, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44007", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [27033]}, {"id": 87537, "acmi_id": "309492", "title": "PANACEA: the documentary", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "panacea-the-documentary", "creator_credit": "Ioannis Ioannou, Cinemedia, Rose Myers, Vanessa Rouse and Arena Theatre Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1999", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;PANACEA the documentary&#8217; follows the journey of Arena Theatre Company&#8217;s creative team as they embark on an ambitious large scale performance event fusing modern technology and cinematic devices.

When his latest tome upsets Napoleon, Dr Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) is despatched to ensure that de Sade be published no more. In charge of the asylum is a benevolent priest Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix) who allows de Sade&#8217;s writings as a form of therapy. Coulmier and Royer-Collard soon come into conflict about the treatment of the Marquis and the running of the asylum. But the priest faces a greater challenge - his lust for a common laundress sparks suppressed desires, but it is she who is sneaking out the Marquis&#8217; incendiary prose. Meanwhile the doctor marries a virginal bride, brought up in a nunnery, who he mercilessly abuses.

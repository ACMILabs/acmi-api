The collection consists of documentation of events and performances throughout the career of the pioneering body artist from the 1970s to the 2000s. Renowned for pushing his body to its limits through durational performance, body modification and surgical enhancement, Stelarc has established a decades-long practice that explores the intersection between the human body and technology, proposing a post-human understanding of the world. This unique archive of video and photographic documentation spans the artist’s early hook suspensions and internal body probes to performances with a robotic third arm and experiments in virtual realities.</p>\n<p>The collection is housed on a variety of formats used since the introduction of video in the 1970s, including reel-to-reel tape, VHS, U-Matic, SP Betacam and Mini DV. These variable formats are currently being digitised to ensure the preservation and legacy of the artist’s archive.</p>\n<p>The Stelarc Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the artist through the Cultural Gifts Program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1332527, "name": "Stelarc", "creator_id": 8996, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 118261, "acmi_id": "B2003948", "title": "[Stelarc: The Third Hand Tokyo 1981]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-the-third-hand-tokyo-1981", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "173786", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970s-2000s Decade", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970s-2000s Decade"}], "labels": [58688]}, {"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This video is documentation of a performance entitled &#8220;Modulate / Meditate: Event for Modified Man&#8221; held at Tamura Gallery in Tokyo, Japan, from 26 January to 1 February 1976.</p>\n<p>In this durational performance, Stelarc has hooks inserted into his back and sews first his lips and then his eyelids closed with a needle and thread.

The paternalistic nature of the troupe&#8217;s organisers towards their boxers gave a feeling of family. However, the film shows both the positives and the negatives: Roy Carroll became Sydney&#8217;s first Aboriginal fight trainer and promoter and George Bracken, a champion of ringside boxing, but there was also an underlying attitude of racism by white Australians towards indigenous people, particularly during this period and some fights could get out of hand. &#8220;In 1971 promoters were required to have boxers and challengers medically examined before each fight and boxers were limited to one fight a week.

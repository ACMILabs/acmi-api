Shortly after she becomes engaged to a charming and urbane Prince, who, appalled by her confession, spurns her, only to regret his impetuousness. &#8220;After death&#8221; Andrei, a young man living in seclusion, is obsessed with death. He attends a lavish garden party where he meets a beguiling actress. Andrei rejects her declaration of love, and following her suicide, laments his actions and is haunted by her ghost. &#8220;The Dying swan&#8221; A painter, obsessed with capturing death in his work, becomes enraptured with the talents of a mute ballerina whose most famed work is &#8216;The Dying swan&#8217;. When the dancer becomes enlivened by love, the artist determines that she will remain the essence of death. In these expressionistic works, Bauer explores the themes of obsession, death, desire, suicide, tragic love and the artistic temperament depicting a reality permeated by dreams, ghosts and visions. With musical score, Russian intertitles and English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Russian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Soviet Union - Social life and customs", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Lust", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hallucinations and illusions", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Russian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Romance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Soviet Union", "Silent films", "Silent films&nbsp;→ Silent films - Soviet Union"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Tinted"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2415487, "name": "Evegnii Bauer", "creator_id": 36049, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2415486, "name": "A Chanshokov", "creator_id": 36048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52023", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 180, "name": "Soviet Union", "slug": "soviet-union"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [33657]}, {"id": 100283, "acmi_id": "E000326", "title": "Macintosh Classic ", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "macintosh-classic-computer", "creator_credit": "Apple Computer Inc.", "credit_line": "<p>ACMI Collection</p>", "headline_credit": "Singapore, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2031-02-16", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>If you took a computer class in Australia during the early 1990s, chances are you used one of these boxy personal computers.

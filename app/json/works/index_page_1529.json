Daiga is an aspiring Lithuanian actress, who arrives in Paris expecting work but finds few opportunities open to her; Theo is a musician and carpenter from Martinique, estranged from the French mother of his young child, who longs to return to his family and homeland; Camille, his brother, is a beautiful drag queen and part time prostitute, joylessly making his way in the gay scene. Around these dynamics unfurls a series of heartless murders of elderly women. Characters grapple with urban dislocation and social isolation whilst recognising their enduring status as outsiders and limited possibilities. Whilst Denis may have intended to draw links between society&#8217;s treatment of those operating outside of the mainstream (immigrants, transvestites, homosexuals) and the consequences of intolerance for difference, generally this film raised the ire of viewers, many of whom interpreted these thematic links with murder as homophobic and racist. Cast includes Yekaterina Golubeva, Richard Courcet, Line Renaud, Beatrice Dalle and Alex Descas.

John, Mick, Paul, Jim and Kerry are workers employed by Brit Rail; when BR is privatised the men find themselves being lured by offers of voluntary redundancy (for large cash sums). Then, working for a private company, and sub-contractors, they are virtually without rights in the workplace, increasingly subject to unstable employment conditions, and despite the overtures of management, are subjected to progressively unsafe workplace practices. Loach explores their private lives, which range from happily married to disgruntled fathers separated from their children, as a way of highlighting the additional burden on families of economic rationalism. Given the subject matter the tone of the film is light and satirical; Loach mines the topic for laughs but never at the expense of keeping his protagonists or their situations, believable, producing an entertaining but at the same time scathing work. Deleted scenes provide some interesting back-stories to the main themes, but also highlight Loach&#8217;s skill in keeping the story focused and tight.

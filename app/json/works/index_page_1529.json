With cinematography by Ron Fricke and mesmerising music by Philip Glass, the film juxtaposes distortion with truth producing quite often alarming results. It is divided into five segments as follows: 1. Crazy life. 2. Life in turmoil. 3. Life out of balance. 4. Life disintegrating. 5. A state of life that calls for another way of living.

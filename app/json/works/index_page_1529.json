D Day arrives and the family is treated to a picnic at the Biggins Air Show. When VE Day is upon them there&#8217;s a dance to attend with 1940&#8217;s enthusiasts. Kirstie is sent to work on aircraft and the family prepare to leave Braemar Gardens. &#8220;2001: Homecoming&#8221;: On returning from the 1940&#8217;s house, Lyn, Michael, Kirstie and the boys discuss how their lives have changed individually and as a family. We are also privy to bloopers from the show - scenes in which the family contravened the regulations laid down to them during the 8 week period. The War Cabinet provides feedback on how serious/usual their breaches were and how they think the Hymer&#8217;s fared in general. Footage of the Hymer&#8217;s visiting a refuge shelter at Chiselhurst is also shown.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:03:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social life and customs", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Children and war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War damage to buildings - Great Britain", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Great Britain", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Family - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social conditions", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - 20th century", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Women - History", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2326090, "name": "Caroline Ross Pirie", "creator_id": 32969, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121057988", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2326087, "name": "Simon Shaw", "creator_id": 32843, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337063", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2326084, "name": "Channel Four Television", "creator_id": 25260, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2326080, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48865", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [30985]}, {"id": 91317, "acmi_id": "314419", "title": "The 1940's house.

For some, like Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci who called it &#8220;the one truly revolutionary film of the last twenty five years&#8221;, &#8220;Gummo&#8221; is a masterpiece. For others, however, it is both exploitative and directionless. Set in the small Ohio town of Xenia (the Greek for &#8220;outsiders&#8221;), the film abandons traditional narrative to instead portray the lives of unemployed and alienated working-class youth in a series of sometimes surrealistic, sometimes shocking vignettes. If the film has a protagonist, it is young Solomon (Jacob Reynolds), who, along with his older friend Tummler (Nick Sutton), kills cats for pocket-money. This is an American suburbia devastated by poverty and in which teenagers passively drift into drugs, alcohol and sex, with occasional violence being the only excitement. The world of this film is unrelentingly grim: a youth pimps his intellectually disabled girlfriend, boys find their thrills in executing cats, and any fragile sense of community or solidarity is blighted by casual racism and misogyny. However, in depicting the existential reality of the emerging Western underclass, Korine also allows surrealistic moments of beauty to intrude. There is genuine warmth and affection between Solomon and his mother (Linda Manz); there is cameraderie and joy when teenager Dot (Chloe Sevigny) is hanging out with her friends, trading beauty tips, miming to pop songs. Using a mixture of professionals and non-actors, filming in both video and 16mm, not only acknowledging but transforming Godardian experiments with sound and vision to reflect a post-proletariat world, Harmony Korine&#8217;s film is undeniably difficult but also undeniably confronting and exhilarating cinema. The lovely voice-over is by Linda Manz and it reflects the director&#8217;s obsession with both cinema and history. Manz was, of course, the shy teenager whose eloquent diary entries gave voice to the dispossessed unemployed in Terrence Malick&#8217;s &#8220;Days of Heaven&#8221; which was set during turn-of-the-century Depression era America. A century on, another class of the dispossessed is emerging. &#8220;Gummo&#8221; will unavoidably create arguments both because of its brutal content and because of its bold experimentation.

Mime artist Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) is desperately in love with the beautiful Garance (Arletty), but she is too world-weary and cynical to believe in his romantic notions of love; instead she begins an affair with the vain actor, Frederick, who dreams of leaving the pantomimes and performing Shakespeare in the grand theatres of Paris. This magical movie, consistently voted the best French film of all time, is a celebration of art and love. While behind the scenes the actors all battle with the bitter realities of unrequited desire or betrayed trust, on stage, performing to the &#8220;children of paradise&#8221; (those too poor to afford seats in the stalls and so have to sit in the &#8220;Gods&#8221;), they transform their sadness into the magic of dreams. It is as if, in this film, Marcel Carne makes good on all the promises of film and theatre to create a truly popular art, and he does so by celebrating not only the lives of the actors and performers on the &#8220;boulevard&#8221;, but also by celebrating the dreams and desires of the raucous, struggling audience that fills the &#8220;gods&#8221;. In the bond between performer and audience we see reflected the pleasures and mistakes of love itself. The sophisticated screenplay is by Jacques Prevert. Considered one of the cinema&#8217;s supreme works of art, the film was partly secretly filmed while Paris was still under Nazi occupation. On all levels, a labour of immense love. Cast also includes Maria Casares and Pierre Renoir.

It is a fascinating but uneven anthology of contemporary art and graphic design up to the late sixties - surrealism, art nouveau, op and pop art - brought together by designer Edelman&#8217;s flattened comic strip, Lennon style whimsy out of Lear and Carroll and play upon the Beatles&#8217; myth. Stand-out sequences include &#8216;Sergeant Pepperland&#8217;, the Borowczyk-style Liverpool sequence, &#8216;Eleanor Rigby&#8217; with Charles Jenkins&#8217; special effects, &#8216;Nowhere Man&#8217; and Dunning&#8217;s rotoscoped &#8216;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&#8217;.

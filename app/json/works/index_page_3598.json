In 1974, Hooker and other progressive psychologists - in tandem with lesbian and gay activists - succesfully petitioned the American Psychiatric Association to drop its definition of homosexuality as a pathological mental illness. This moving biography includes interviews with Hooker and archival documentation of the &#8220;underground&#8221; lesbian and homosexual communities in America during the 1950s and 1960s. &#8220;Changing Our Minds&#8221; was nominated for an Academy Award in 1993 for Best Feature Documentary. Narrated by Patrick Stewart.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Civil rights - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology - Research", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sex (Psychology)", "People&nbsp;→ Hooker, Dr. Evelyn"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/changing-our-minds-the-story-of-dr-evelyn-hooker", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1810376, "name": "David Haugland", "creator_id": 26291, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952173, "name": "Intrepid Productions", "creator_id": 26290, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952175, "name": "Richard Schmiechen", "creator_id": 20460, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952172, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40117", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [23666], "external_references": [{"id": 3787, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "149404"}]}]}

The group includes Lady Random (Maggie Smith), widow of the British ambassador to Italy, Arabella (Judy Dench) an artist and singer, Georgie (Lily Tomlin), an exuberant American archaeologist, and the brash and uninhibited Elsa (Cher). One of the ladies, Mary (Joan Plowright), becomes a surrogate mother to a young boy, Luca, and he is soon virtually adopted and brought up by the group. As Luca grows to become a man, the shifting political climate begins to have a devastating impact on the rarified world in which the ladies exist, and they must come to terms not only with their own mortality but also the inescapable passage of time.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Florence (Italy)", "Biographical", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fascism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Florence (Italy)", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Places&nbsp;→ Florence (Italy)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/tea-with-mussolini", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959677, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959678, "name": "Medusa Film", "creator_id": 32743, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959679, "name": "Cattleya", "creator_id": 32744, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959680, "name": "Cineritmo", "creator_id": 28175, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959681, "name": "G2", "creator_id": 79513, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959682, "name": "Riccardo Tozzi", "creator_id": 79514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959683, "name": "Giovanella Zannoni", "creator_id": 79515, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959684, "name": "Clive Parsons", "creator_id": 77372, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959685, "name": "Franco Zeffirelli", "creator_id": 22834, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 959676, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48496", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [30650], "external_references": [{"id": 5570, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10368"}]}]}

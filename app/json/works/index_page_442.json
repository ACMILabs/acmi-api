The first post-revolution Iranian film to be released internationally, Naderi&#8217;s film is a beautifully photographed, deceptively simple film which is decidedly sophisticated in the ways it changes mood. Raw in parts, upbeat in others, Runner brilliantly uses striking images and sound to take you right into Amiro&#8217;s world.

When  Gabin&#8217;s erstwhile comrade (Lino Ventura) hears this news, the plot of the film, adapted from an Albert Simonin serie noire novel, kicks in. What concerns Becker is that eternal theme, the question of honor among thieves. Gabin is suddenly thrust into a dangerous, volatile predicament, but his loyalty to the foolish Darcy never flags. &#8216;Grisbi&#8217; is loaded with night-life atmosphere, and it offers the unique opportunity to see together France&#8217;s greatest screen icon, Gabin, the virile man of the people, with Moreau and Ventura, who were to become icons themselves. Indeed, Ventura (in his screen debut), whom Becker discovered in a wrestling ring, would eventually succeed Gabin as France&#8217;s definitive, world-weary tough guy. There are a couple of moments when Moreau, who would become the grande dame of the French cinema, has an uncanny Brigitte Bardot look, but already she projected a hauteur to be reckoned with.&#8221; Reference: Kevin Thomas. &#8216;Cinema dangereuse&#8217;.

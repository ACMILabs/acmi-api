Bob Parish was born on 7 May 1916 and played a long and distinguished part in Victorian and Australian cricket over many years. In particular he was Chairman of the Australian Cricket Board(ACB) from 1975-80 during which time a major development in international cricket took place - that of the creation of World Series Cricket(WSC). The new &#8216;television friendly&#8217; game of WSC could not develop without the assistance of the ACB and it was in negotiating this relationship between the ACB and WSC that Bob Parish played a central role.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cricket - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2121249, "name": "Daryl Dellora", "creator_id": 6331, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q117862792", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2121256, "name": "David Beesley", "creator_id": 73131, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2121251, "name": "Daryl Dellora", "creator_id": 6331, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q117862792", "role": "interviewer", "role_id": 457, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "86", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "05 OCT 1999", "notes": "", "to_year": "05 OCT 1999"}], "labels": [47416]}, {"id": 84192, "acmi_id": "305492", "title": "Bob and Bobek. - Volume 1.", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bob-and-bobek-volume-1", "creator_credit": "Special Broadcasting Services", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Czechoslovakia, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Bob and Bobek are two lovable white rabbits who will delight children up to the age of eight years.

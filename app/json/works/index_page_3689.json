Embittered by her poverty and hard life she never posts the letters she writes for the city&#8217;s illiterates. Her life is drastically changed, however, when a young boy, Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira), insists she post a letter his mother had written to his estranged father shortly before she was killed. Initially resistant, Dora takes responsibility for Josue and they begin a long road journey through the heart of the country to find Josue&#8217;s father. &#8220;Central Station&#8221; is a film that celebrates the humanity of its characters whilst refusing to either exploit or diminish the brutal realities of life for Brazil&#8217;s homeless and working poor. Whether showing us the squalor of Rio, the vast mountainous beauty of southern Brazil, the ecstatic richness of a religious festival or the endless uniform drabness of working class estates, Walter Salles&#8217; direction remains assured and free of sentimentality. The performances by Montenegro, de Oliveira and Marila Pera are outstanding. Winner of the Golden Bear at the 1998 Berlin Film Festival.

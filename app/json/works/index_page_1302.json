Legend goes that the ancient school was once the residence of a witches coven, headed by an evil and powerful black witch named Mater Suspiriorum (Black Widow). When a series of grisly murders begin to occur at the ballet school, Susy begins to suspect that witchcraft may be involved. Working at the height of his creative powers (following the box office success of 1975&#8217;s &#8216;Deep Red&#8217;) Argento raises the level of terror with his trademark blood soaked set pieces by using vibrant colour film stock, abrupt editing, multi-layered sound scapes (including the techno-rock Goblin score) and rapid camera movement. Cast also includes Alida Valli, Udo Kier, Stefania Casini, Joan Bennett, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bose, Barbara Magnolfi and Susanna Javicoli.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Germany", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Occultism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Witchcraft", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Places&nbsp;→ Germany"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957747, "name": "Dario Argento", "creator_id": 1456, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957746, "name": "Claudio Argento", "creator_id": 1530, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957745, "name": "La Seda", "creator_id": 30848, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18975, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5ya8jTbNZTrCFUx9OwpNBjCivXY.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Suspiria  (Dario Argento) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45880", "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [28395]}, {"id": 85, "acmi_id": "tmdb-movie-361292", "title": "Suspiria (2018)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "suspiria-2018", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy and United States of America, 2018", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/works/image/dzWTnkert9EoiPWldWJ15dnfAFl.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2018-10-11T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the troupe&#8217;s artistic director, an ambitious young dancer and a grieving psychotherapist.

De Palma has always been one of Hitchcock&#8217;s staunchest heirs and &#8220;Femme fatale&#8221; is a continuation of that master&#8217;s pleasure in creating a virtuoso cinema of spectacle, technique and purely cinematic language. From the sharpness of Bill Pankow&#8217;s editing to the sublime use of split-screen and subjective camera, from the clever pastiche of Ryuichi Sakamoto&#8217;s score to the crisp cinematography of Theirry Arbogast, &#8220;Femme fatale&#8221; is a film in love with cinema itself. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos makes for a suitably sexy and dangerous noir heroine; Antonio Banderas is the mug who falls in love with her; and there are guest cameos by Cannes Film Festival director, Gilles Jacob, by French director Regis Wargnier and French actress, Sandrine Bonnaire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "Norwegian", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cannes Film Festival", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Closed captioning", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Paris (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2238251, "name": "Brian De Palma", "creator_id": 63836, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2238248, "name": "Marina Gefter", "creator_id": 80736, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2238246, "name": "Tarak Ben Ammar", "creator_id": 23466, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2238243, "name": "Quinta Communications", "creator_id": 36240, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2238239, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52212", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33825], "external_references": []}]}

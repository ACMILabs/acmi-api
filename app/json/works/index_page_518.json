Filmmaker Anand Patwardhan presents ordinary Indians vying for peace and taking part in grass roots activism in light of India&#8217;s increased interest in nuclear power. He also examines the impact of American policy and the way in which American points of view (in particular &#8216;might is right&#8217;) has derailed the arguments about the perils of nuclear warfare. One segment is devoted to examining the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - which continue to remain contentious subjects for the US military. The Smithsonian Institute for example experienced conflict from the government when it mounted an exhibit about the after-effects of the nuclear manoeuvrings of World War 2. A post-credit sequence briefly addresses September 11 terrorist attack. This is an intelligent, insightful and important work.

But for some along the way old relationships are challenged and a new dynamic emerges as some friends come-of-age on their travels and others simply end up with terrific hangovers. Based on a play by Stephen Davis. Cast includes Tony Brockman, Travis Cotton, Jamie Croft, Jessica Gower, Craig Horner, Mark Priestley, Charlotte Rees, Nathalie Roy, Kristian Schmid, Veronica Sywak, Petra Yared, and Matthew Newton. &#8212; Mate (prod. Jan Aird, 1997, 10min.) This witty short film also by filmmaker Evan Clarry is included in the special features.

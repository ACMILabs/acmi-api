Pages are machine folded into sections - two types of folding machines are seen in operation; sections are then pressed and the end papers glued. The different sections comprising a book are sewn together; pressing machines round and shoulder the spines which are then glued to receive the cheesecloth; the building in process, in which the shoulders and backs of the books are shaped, is followed by the making and affixing of the cases. After lettering, dust covers are added by hand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Bookbinding", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Career development", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Printing industry", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Bookbinding", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Books", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Career development", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Printing", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Books", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1560008, "name": "John Kingsford-Smith", "creator_id": 12540, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q120695378", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1560007, "name": "Kingcroft Productions", "creator_id": 12634, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034727", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114936, "acmi_id": "S00612", "title": "Printing as a Career", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "printing-as-a-career", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 71527, "acmi_id": "008340", "title": "Photo-engraving and letterpress printing", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "photo-engraving-and-letterpress-printing", "creator_credit": "John Kingsford-Smith, Kingcroft Productions and Printed and Allied Trade Employees Federation of Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1953", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1953-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, {"id": 66303, "acmi_id": "002304", "title": "The Compositor's work in the graphic arts", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-compositors-work-in-the-graphic-arts", "creator_credit": "John Kingsford-Smith and Printing and Allied Trade Employers Federation of Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1953", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1953-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21123", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [5021]}, {"id": 77866, "acmi_id": "016257", "title": "Book bargain", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "book-bargain", "creator_credit": "Norman McLaren and GPO Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1936", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Set inside a printing factory in the mid 1930&#8217;s, this film documents the production of the London telephone directory.

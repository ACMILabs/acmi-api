The nightmares of the meat-hook-wielding fisherman are preventing Julie from putting the brutal murder of her best friend, Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), behind her. Luckily, Julie has made a new best friend, Karla (Brandy), who has won a trip to the Bahamas and convinces Julie to go with her and some other friends.

For her part May is being wooed by another man but is inextricably drawn to Eddie, despite the proven destructive nature of their union. Over the course of the evening she and Eddie argue violently and make up passionately as the heart-rending history of their relationship, replete with flashbacks, unfurls. Harry Dean Stanton plays a barfly whose identity holds a key role to these lovers&#8217; sorrow. &#8220;Fool for love&#8221; garnered mostly negative reviews and found a very limited audience, regardless of praise for Basinger&#8217;s bravura performance. Most decried the device of opening up the play, outside of its claustrophobic one room structure, in favour of a wider locale, which may have robbed it of the intimate tensions generated by the ill-matched pair battling it out in a confined space. But despite this the incendiary relationship between the principal characters is astutely portrayed, achieving a suitably tragic tone within a desolate setting.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Conjugal violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Alcohol use", "History&nbsp;→ Cowboys", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "People&nbsp;→ Cowboys"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fool-for-love", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963657, "name": "Cannon Group", "creator_id": 6925, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963658, "name": "Menahem Golan", "creator_id": 76710, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963660, "name": "Yoram Globus", "creator_id": 76711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963662, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963659, "name": "Menahem Golan", "creator_id": 76710, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963661, "name": "Yoram Globus", "creator_id": 76711, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963663, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963656, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52117", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [33742], "external_references": [{"id": 1911, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1435973"}, {"id": 4187, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "71125"}]}, {"id": 86470, "acmi_id": "308150", "title": "Fontane Effi Briest = Effi Briest", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fontane-effi-briest-effi-briest", "creator_credit": "Tango Film, Filverlag der Authoren and Rainer Werner Fassbinder", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany (West), 1974", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Possibly Fassbinder&#8217;s most exquisite film, this is the story of a seventeen year old girl stifled in a loveless marriage, too naive to understand that her liaison with one of her husband&#8217;s friends risks bringing disaster on both of them.

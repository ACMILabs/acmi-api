The film deals with the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth&#8217;s life opening in the Garden of Gethsemane. Betrayed by the disciple Judas, Jesus (Jim Caviezel) is arrested and stands accused of blasphemy before religious leaders, who insist he should be punished by death. Before the crucifixion however, he is whipped and beaten and the graphic nature of the violence (torturous instruments that remove chunks of flesh shown in slow-motion) may prove too much for some viewers. The film employs the use of brief flashbacks as a vehicle to cover the last supper and life-changing experiences of other important people in his life; namely disciples, his mother Mary and Mary Magdalene. This religious drama uses the original languages of the day as an attempt to add to a more timeless and authentic telling of the story. Production design and cinematography give the film a painterly feel and majestic musical score adds to the emotional intensity, particularly at times when no dialogue is spoken.

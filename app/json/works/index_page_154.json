Part black humour, part tragi-comedy, &#8220;About Schmidt&#8221; successes are almost entirely attributable to Jack Nicholson&#8217;s winning performance as the embittered and deluded protagonist. One of the most amusing components of the film is Schmidt&#8217;s letters of emotional outpouring to a young Tanzanian orphan named Ndugu, whom he sponsors on a whim. These letters reveal Schmidt&#8217;s deep-rooted irritation and frustration at the turns his life has taken, his thwarted dreams and suppressed desires. The film is also part road movie as Schmidt embarks upon a trip en route to his daughter&#8217;s home - in a monstrous 35-foot Winnebago Adventurer. Whilst &#8220;Schmidt&#8221; succeeds on many levels, mainly as a fine portrait of a man in crisis, it is also possible to argue that the film fails to sustain its dramaturgical energy and wanes where one expects it to erupt.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Greek"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/about-schmidt", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999571, "name": "Alexander Payne", "creator_id": 79849, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q313566", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999570, "name": "Harry Gittes", "creator_id": 79619, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999569, "name": "Michael Besman", "creator_id": 78699, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999568, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999567, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52485", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34034], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94526, "acmi_id": "318433", "title": "The Nugget", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-nugget-dvd", "creator_credit": "Bill Bennett, Jennifer Cluff, b j films, Macquarie Film Corporation and Film Finance Corporation Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Lotto, Wookie and Sue are three working class mates whose favourite pastime is to frolic in the outback on a futile hunt for gold, dodging the protestations of their spouses.

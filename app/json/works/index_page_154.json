Although she&#8217;s never felt better, Hazel pretends to be dying in order to accept the offer of an all-expenses-paid visit to New York City made by a newspaper reporter. By the time the reporter begins churning out daily reports of the tragedy, half of Manhattan is in tears and Hazel is built up to be a brave &#8216;suffering in silence&#8217; charmer and is lionized by the media and public. When Hazel cannot disguise her good health any longer, a group of her financial backers wise up to her ruse and ask her to find a way to die and save them all further embarassment.This was one of the first screwball comedies ever produced, and possibly one of the finest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Screwball comedies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/nothing-sacred", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999679, "name": "William Wellman", "creator_id": 22137, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q290962", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999678, "name": "David O.

Valence is aggrieved by the sudden death of close family, retreating somewhat, but also drawing enormous pleasure from the responsibility of caring for his grandson. Internalising his grief, Valence comes to terms with the fact that society is changing whilst he remains the same - his agent offers him parts in lucrative but lowbrow dramas, despite Valence&#8217;s protestation that he values his craft; similarly Valence is outraged by the suggestion that he may find solace in romance with a young actress. Piccoli puts in a grand performance as Valence, and de Oliveira captures the savouring of everyday pleasures - a fine new pair of shoes or a daily coffee at his favourite cafe. These observations set a gently comic, if slightly melancholic tone, providing a deft and moving rumination on the themes of aging and artistry.

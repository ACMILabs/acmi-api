Tough Northern humour, outrageous self abuse and self mocking throughout this is a fine portrayal of the Manchester music scene.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Manchester (England)", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Mockumentary", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Nightclubs", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Clash (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Electronic music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Sex Pistols (Musical group)", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ Clash (Musical group)", "People&nbsp;→ Sex Pistols (Musical group)", "Places&nbsp;→ Manchester (England)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/24-hour-party-people", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2000142, "name": "Michael Winterbottom", "creator_id": 51082, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q380237", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000141, "name": "Andrew Eaton", "creator_id": 51084, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4756878", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000140, "name": "Baby Cow", "creator_id": 81088, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000139, "name": "Film Four International", "creator_id": 23614, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000138, "name": "Film Council", "creator_id": 35985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000137, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000136, "name": "Revolution Films", "creator_id": 51049, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000135, "name": "Film Consortium", "creator_id": 60982, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2000134, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53030", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [34478], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94959, "acmi_id": "318995", "title": "Thirteen conversations about one thing = 13 conversations ab", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "thirteen-conversations-about-one-thing-13-conversations-ab", "creator_credit": "Jill Sprecher, Gina Resnick, Beni Atoori, Echo Lake Productions and Stonelock Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>What is happiness?

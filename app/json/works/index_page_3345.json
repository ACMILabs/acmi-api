Based on a novel by Ronald Hugh Morrieson, &#8220;The Scarecrow&#8221; is the feature debut of director Sam Pillsbury. The film is full of telling and often comic details of life in the small community. Gothic elements are highlighted by the presence of the Scarecrow and insistence upon the eccentric. Cast also includes Tracy Mann.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social life and customs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New Zealand - Social conditions", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - New Zealand"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 808126, "name": "Sam Pillsbury", "creator_id": 13179, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7408020", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1815717, "name": "Rob Whitehouse", "creator_id": 32858, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 808124, "name": "New Zealand National Film Unit", "creator_id": 12257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 808123, "name": "Oasis Films", "creator_id": 32857, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48684", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 9, "name": "New Zealand", "slug": "new-zealand"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [30821]}, {"id": 72505, "acmi_id": "009457", "title": "The Scarab mechanical horse", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-scarab-mechanical-horse", "creator_credit": "Gordon O'Connell and Gate Film Production", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1956", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1956-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Demonstrates the special advances in modern industry and communication of the Scarab Mechanical Horse, a three-wheeled traction united designed to tow a variety of trailers.

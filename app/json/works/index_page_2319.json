Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold) is a sensitive young poet who naively decides to leave the safety of Oslo and his girlfriend Gertrude (Camilla Martens) to embark on a fur-trapping expedition to Greenland for twelve months. It is the year 1925. On arrival at the east coast of Greenland, Henrik is teamed up with two experienced trappers, the rough and intimidating Randbek (Stellan Skarsgard) and the quieter introspective scientist, Holm (Bjorn Sundquist). Their living quarters for the twelve months is a tiny isolated hut in the bleak icy sparseness of the Greenland wastelands where tension and conflict between the three escalates to unimaginable heights, and man&#8217;s inhumanity to man emerges as more than just a threat.

The film is populated by unsavoury characters, who dress and act repulsively and speak in a crass and offensive dialogue, littered with ockerisms and bush slang. Teddy, a New York con artist flees America and goes on the lam in Australia. Once there is seduced by the sexually voracious Angie and taken to her hometown of Woop Woop where he is effectively imprisoned by the law of Daddy-O, Angie&#8217;s tyrannical father. Amongst other eccentric behaviours, the town folk gather nightly to watch &#8220;The Sound of music&#8221; and &#8220;South Pacific&#8221; played on a loop at the local drive-in. Elliot confounds viewer expectations offering up more extreme and vulgar outback personalities than could possibly be imagined, making these characters repugnant to watch. The film slyly sends up films such as &#8220;Crocodile Dundee&#8221; which pandered to the gross stereotypes that so appealed to audiences. Elliot however failed to appeal to anyone with this bizarre and subversive flick, receiving critical brickbats and woeful box office returns.<br />\nCast includes: Johnathon Schaech, Rod Taylor, Susie Porter,  Richard Moir, Maggie Kirkpatrick, Barry Humphries and Paul Mercurio</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/welcome-to-woop-woop", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998313, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2094420", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998312, "name": "Finola Dwyer", "creator_id": 71846, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q22075518", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998310, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126876", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998309, "name": "Scala Productions", "creator_id": 35620, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998311, "name": "Unthank Films", "creator_id": 35621, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33223]}, {"id": 93719, "acmi_id": "317300", "title": "Mistress = Maitresse (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mistress-maitresse-d", "creator_credit": "Barbet Schroeder, Pierre Andrieux and Les Films du Losange", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1976", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47517, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q645447"}], "brief_description": "<p>Olivier (Gerard Depardieau), a petty thief who breaks into the flat of a young woman, Ariane, is startled to discover she is a dominatrix operating a lair devoted to sado-masochistic practices for an array of wealthy clients.

The sinister looking doll which is possessed by the evil spirit of a serial killer is resurrected from the dead by his unbalanced goth girlfriend (played with relish by Jennifer Tilly), who has wedding bells on her mind. However Chucky has more sinister intentions than marriage, when he and his trailer trash bride stow away with two runaway teens wrongly accused of murder. Hong Kong director Ronny Yu (&#8216;Bride with the white hair&#8217;), and writer Don Mancini have fashioned a wonderfully irresponsible film which proudly wears it&#8217;s horror film references on its sleeve, giving the series some surreal, clever twists and turns.

Along the way they strive to overcome drug addiction, rat infestation, and chronic destitution, not to mention tension in their relationships with fellow inhabitants; all while maintaining a strength which shatters society&#8217;s myths of homelessness. The tunnel- dwellers acted not only as the subjects for this documentary, but also producers and crewmembers, fighting for their voice to be heard and their story to be told.

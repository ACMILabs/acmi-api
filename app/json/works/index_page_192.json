Faced with prejudice, unemployment and the cultural dislocation that comes with being migrants, many of the young Pontians turn increasingly to violence, crime and prostitution to survive. Utilising documentary techniques - hand-held camera, straight-to-camera monologues and interviews - the film examines the life of 17 year old Sasha (Stathis Papadopoulos), the brash fearless leader of a gang who sell drugs and their bodies in Athens&#8217;s red-light district behind Ommonia Square. Juxtaposing documentary sequences with dream-like evocations of Sasha&#8217;s life in the former USSR, &#8220;From the edge of the city&#8221; is a kinetic work that paints a bleak portrait of the realities facing immigrants in twenty-first century Europe.

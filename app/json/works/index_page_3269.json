Fed up with paranoid lovers, endless bundles of blood test results, and the consuming fear of investing emotionally in a partner he may lose to AIDS, Jeffrey decides to give up sex for good. He rationalises that this will allow him to channel his energy into his career and hobbies, which in turn will help him to forget about sex. However, his resolve is soon put to the test when he meets the gorgeous body-builder Steve (Michael T. Weiss) while working out at the gym. Torn between wanting to ravish Steve and wanting to maintain his celibacy, Jeffrey turns to his best friend Sterling (Patrick Stewart) for advice. As circumstances (and friends) conspire to bring Steve and Jeffrey together, Jeffrey begins to warm to the idea of a committed relationship. However, Steve&#8217;s revelation about his HIV-positive status soon throws a spanner in the works and Jeffrey finds himself caught between love and fear once again. Seeking the advice of Sterling and his partner Darius, a post-modern evangelist, a self-help group, his liberal parents, and a randy Catholic priest, Jeffrey struggles to come to terms with the concept that a life lived in fear is no life at all. Features a variety of cameos from stars such as Sigourney Weaver, Camryn Manheim, Olympia Dukakis, Kathy Najimy, Christine Baranski, and Nathan Lane.

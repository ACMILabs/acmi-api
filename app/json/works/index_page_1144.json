One is the Australian Jack Findlay, who manages to stay in the game through sheer spunk and the help of his French wife and many friends. He often has accidents, lacks a corporate sponsor, and sometimes must borrow even the machines he races with. Giacomo Agostini, on the other hand, seems to be singularly blessed. As the reigning champion (in 1971) and a noteworthy playboy, he has all the sponsorship he could ask for, and wins his races without injuries or spills.

In this battle, 1200 men of the South Wales Borderers confronted four thousand attacking Zulu warriors. A stunning, historically accurate, battle picture starring the great British actors Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins and Michael Caine in his first screen role. A movie of &#8220;epic&#8221; proportions, the long and bloody battle is depicted in meticulous detail. The Zulus, who had never seen a motion picture, were shown an old Roy Rogers western to assist their performance. The Zulu chief is played by the real-life Chief Buthelezzi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Colonies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Foreign relations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Africa - History", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Colonies", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - 19th century"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952895, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952896, "name": "Joseph E.

Charlie, Wren, Scotty and Jesse are rich Upper West-side teens, hanging with a black gang (some of whom have become friends/lovers) picking up on the language and imitating the aesthetic of rap culture; Terry and Sam are documentary filmmakers (unharmoniously married) filming these white teens; Mark is a gambler seeking a fix on a game from basketball player Dean; Cigar and crew are rappers trying to cut a record; Rich Bower is the power broker among the black rappers whose business dealings draw those around him into dangerous ventures. This film is an examination of the intersection of white and black culture in New York, which uses overlapping storylines to present a multitude of narratives. Starring: Robert Downey Jr, Brooke Shields, Elijah Woods, Claudia Schiffer, Ben Stiller, Jared Leto, Joe Pantoliano, Mike Tyson and Bijou Phillips.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Bulgarian", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "German", "German", "Greek", "Hebrew", "Hindi", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hip-hop - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Hip-hop - New York (State) - New York", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music and dance - Cross-cultural studies", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music videos", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rap (Music)", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2116545, "name": "James Toback", "creator_id": 35230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2116543, "name": "Ron Rotholz", "creator_id": 80302, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2116542, "name": "Screen Gems", "creator_id": 48770, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2116538, "name": "Palm Pictures", "creator_id": 34060, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51053", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32988], "external_references": []}, {"id": 65469, "acmi_id": "320245", "title": "Bjorn Wiinblad", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bjorn-wiinblad", "creator_credit": "Frank Paulsen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Denmark, 1969", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Portrait of the Danish artist and designer.

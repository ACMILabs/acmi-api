I was only seven years old. My father had retired from playing and was a trainer.</p>\n<p>But there were as many mascots as there were players on the day. There were sort of two teams run out for that Grand Final in Hamilton colors. And one of them was all mascots, and then there was the senior team.

I don&#8217;t think many cows were milked. I don&#8217;t think any other jobs were done that day, because the whole town was there.</p>\n<p>And if you look in the photograph, you&#8217;ll see the very, very big crowd there, up the stairs of the grandstand, the Noble Oval grandstand. The whole stand was packed. Right round the ground was five or six deep, and you just couldn&#8217;t get in anywhere.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>The rivalry was pretty intense in Hamilton. You were either in the Hamilton camp or the Imps camp, and never the twain shall meet. I believe that&#8217;s changed a little bit in recent times, but it&#8217;s always been a pretty fierce rivalry.</p>\n<p>Our next door neighbors were Imperial supporters. We were Hamilton supporters.

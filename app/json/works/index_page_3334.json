Schlesinger&#8217;s confident direction is beautifully complimented by Nicholas Roeg&#8217;s luscious cinematography which highlights the wild, stark grandeur of the south English coast, a perfect visual equivalent to Hardy&#8217;s expressive naturalist prose. This film is a passionate love story and a powerful investigation into the emotional treachery of the English class system.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953219, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953220, "name": "Vic Films", "creator_id": 23842, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953221, "name": "Joseph Janni", "creator_id": 22931, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953222, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953218, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40911", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [24433]}, {"id": 94987, "acmi_id": "319023", "title": "Far from Heaven", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "far-from-heaven-dvd", "creator_credit": "Focus Features, Vulcan Productions, Jody Patton, Christine Vachon and Todd Haynes", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2002", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Mrs Cathy Whitaker (Julianne Moore) is the equivalent of the 1950s super mom - running the household for her busy executive husband and two young children with the help of her African American maid Sybil.

The artists in this story tell of their own personal experiences, their day-to-day life and the effect the conflict has had on their families, and how the ongoing struggle for independence has kept alive their culture and influenced their works. In turn, it has been through their works that they have been able to educate, express and motivate their people to maintain the fight for independence. Director Danielle Smith lived as a member of a large extended family in the Saharawi refugee camps in southwest Algeria and taught English at the Women&#8217;s Vocational Centre. Through this experience she gained a close understanding of the culture and society. NB: The color in the film appears faded and washed out and the quality of the lighting to be overexposed. However this tonal condition lends itself to giving the film an air of surrealism.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Morocco", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Sahara Desert", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environment (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Themes, motives", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists and community", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Environment (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Politics in art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Realism in art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Symbolism in art", "Documentary", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Algeria - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Colonization", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politics in art", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Refugees", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Colonization", "History&nbsp;→ Refugees", "History&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Artists - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Poets - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Places&nbsp;→ Morocco", "Places&nbsp;→ Sahara Desert"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2330052, "name": "Danielle Smith", "creator_id": 80784, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2330047, "name": "Dakkuma Productions", "creator_id": 36388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52317", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 215, "name": "Algeria", "slug": "algeria"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [33910], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95214, "acmi_id": "319269", "title": "The Beast must die", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-beast-must-die-dvd", "creator_credit": "Paul Annett, Milton Subotsky, Max J Rosenberg and Amicus Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1974", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A wealthy and ambitious hunter gathers several guests to his expansive country estate with the intention of revealing that one is a werewolf.

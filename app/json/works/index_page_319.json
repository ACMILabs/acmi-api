The program celebrates the excesses of the reality television genre and delivers the ultimate promise to would-be-voyeurs by filming it&#8217;s &#8216;contestants&#8217; constantly for the duration of the show (with the help of 23 cameras). The program, run as a winner takes-all competition, placed twelve strangers in a house (six girls and six boys) to live with each other for a period of three months (85 days). A set of rules were put in place, along with a number of set tasks (or challenges) that had to be completed (or performed) by the house-mates. Each week a house-mate would be voted off by the public from the show, whilst the competition grew and the public interest intensified to a dramatic climax that revealed the final winner. Relive the fun, drama, screams, precocious parading and much un-scripted antics of the original twelve that dared show us all how they could cope under 24 hour surveillance!

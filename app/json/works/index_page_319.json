What is astonishing is how much the gritty, free-wheeling camera style predates the French New Wave. Everything is already here, the jump-cuts, jazzy score and visual quotes. This is the kind of film that we want to make! exclaimed the young and rebellious Francois Truffaut in 1955. Godard acknowledged Melville&#8217;s influence, giving him an extended cameo in &#8216;A bout de souffle&#8217; (&#8216;Breathless&#8217;). Melville&#8217;s influence has also been acknowledged by foreign filmmaker such as Quentin Tarantino and John Woo. Melville only had a small budget for this film and could only afford three lights. The lack of lighting being a hindrance for depth of film, most of the backgrounds appear soft on the screen. This effect became a trademark of the film and made Henri Decae a director of photography in high demand.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Florence Melville ; director, Jean-Pierre Melville ; writers, Jean-Pierre Melville, Auguste Le Breton ; photography, Henri Decae ; music, Eddie Barclay, Jo Boyer ; costumes, Ted Lapidus.<br />\nCast: Isabel Corey, Roger Duchesne, Daniel Cauchy, Guy Decomble, Simone Paris, Andre Garet, Claude Cerval, Colette Fleury, Gerard Buhr, Howard Vernon.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1804361, "name": "Florence Melville", "creator_id": 34084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890611, "name": "Jean-Pierre Melville", "creator_id": 28889, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q168693", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146748", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1956", "notes": "", "to_year": "1956"}], "labels": [55519], "external_references": [{"id": 795, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1257189"}]}, {"id": 116023, "acmi_id": "X000198", "title": "Le Grand Jeu = the Full Deck", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "le-grand-jeu-the-full-deck", "creator_credit": "Jacques Feyder", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1934", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1934-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Scripted by frequent Feyder collaborator Charles Spaak, the film focuses on lawyer Pierre Martel, who runs up huge debts to help keep his mistress, Florence, in style.

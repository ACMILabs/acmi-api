It would be an interesting exercise to compare this film with &#8220;Dr. Strangelove&#8221; as both films deal with the same premise, which led to claims of plagiarism when &#8220;Failsafe&#8221; was originally released.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Atomic bomb", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Nuclear warfare", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952990, "name": "Sidney Lumet", "creator_id": 72312, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952989, "name": "Max Youngstein", "creator_id": 77710, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952988, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952987, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40629", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [24158]}, {"id": 95013, "acmi_id": "319052", "title": "Fahrenheit 9/11", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fahrenheit-911-dvd", "creator_credit": "Michael Moore, Kathleen Glynn, Jim Czarnecki, Lions Gate Films, The Fellowship Adventure Group, IFC Productions (US) and Dog Eat Dog Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2004", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2004-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>The heat is up in this award-winning documentary made by maverick dissident Michael Moore (&#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221;) with his sharp wit and biting commentary on the United States&#8217; Government and contemporary America.

Using archival footage (including previously unseen footage), interviews with key players, and audio tapes made in the Oval Office of the White House (also previously unheard) this program traces the political theories and deceptions which led to this infamous and divisive conflict. Narrated by Martin Sheen. &#8220;Nationalism and nation building 1945-60&#8221; - Deals with the background to the conflict, from the Japanese invasion of the then French colony of Vietnam during World War II, to America&#8217;s involvement and support (as allies to France) to equip Ho Chi Minh&#8217;s nationalist army to fight the Japanese and the eventual turnaround by the Americans towards Ho Chi Minh as communism began to expand from the USSR and China to South East Asia by way of North Vietnam. Also discusses Eisenhower&#8217;s &#8220;domino&#8221; theory and America&#8217;s absolute fear of communism, the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, and the CIA installation of Ngo Dinh Diem as President of South Vietnam. &#8220;Advisers and assassinations 1960-63&#8221; - 1961 sees the election of President John F. Kennedy and Robert MacNamara as Secretary of State. Soviets put their support behind Ho Chi Minh and America finds itself struggling with an unpopular and repressive Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh and his guerillas are advancing into the South and Kennedy reluctantly sends thousands more troops into South Vietnam to combat the Viet Cong. An American-backed coup takes place on 4 November 1963 in South Vietnam to get rid of Diem and three weeks later John F. Kennedy is assassinated. &#8220;Countdown to war 1963-65&#8221; - Lyndon Johnson, elected as the new President of the US, is determined to carry on where Kennedy left off. Coup after coup takes place in South Vietnam - with the help of the CIA - destabilising the country whilst Ho Chi Minh and his guerillas are winning the battle in the rural areas of South Vietnam. The &#8220;domino&#8221; theory is still alive and well in the US and with mounting support by the USSR and China for the Viet Cong, Johnson is faced with the decision to either &#8220;go in or withdraw&#8221;. On 5 August 1964, the US, deliberately or mistakenly, attacked North Vietnam. By 1965 the US had a commitment of 150,000 ground troops in Vietnam. The conflict was to continue for another ten years.

Ho Chi Minh and his guerillas are advancing into the South and Kennedy reluctantly sends thousands more troops into South Vietnam to combat the Viet Cong. An American-backed coup takes place on 4 November 1963 in South Vietnam to get rid of Diem and three weeks later John F.

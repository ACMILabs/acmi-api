The film focuses chiefly on lead singer and songwriter Jeff Tweedy, a man driven by the urge to create, write and produce music who is at times perplexed by the vagaries of the music industry and the demands placed upon him as the face of Wilco. Shooting on 16mm, in black and white, with a hand-held camera, Jones creates a document that apes the successful look and feel of &#8220;Don&#8217;t look back&#8221; (1967) D. A. Pennebaker&#8217;s legendary examination of Bob Dylan on tour and in the spotlight at a crucial time of his career. Whilst Jones&#8217; work cannot claim the same iconic status, his documentary is also an intimate, personal view of an artist at odds with the current traits of the American music business, with his fellow musicians and at times, with himself. Features footage of live performances, studio work and interviews with Wilco and various colleagues.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artistic collaboration", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composition (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Guitarists", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963899, "name": "Cowboy Pictures", "creator_id": 36299, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963900, "name": "Experience Music Project", "creator_id": 36300, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963901, "name": "Fusionfilms", "creator_id": 36301, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963902, "name": "Plexifilm", "creator_id": 36302, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963903, "name": "Peter Abraham", "creator_id": 80762, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963904, "name": "Sam Jones", "creator_id": 36304, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963905, "name": "Sam Jones", "creator_id": 36304, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963898, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52254", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33861]}, {"id": 114400, "acmi_id": "B2003012", "title": "I am Tom Moody", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-am-tom-moody", "creator_credit": "Ainslie Henderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Scotland, 2012", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2012-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>As the performer steps up to the microphone, will the desire to make music be defeated by fears of failure and feelings of inadequacy?

"<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at

regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film is a wonderful composite of the Nixon family’s life enjoying the company of their extended family at weddings, birthday gatherings and at the family holiday homes as well as on their travels to the Gold Coast, Queensland and Eildon Weir, Victoria.

"<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight. TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) was the major air service in the 1960s and 1970s flying to destinations all over Australian and its near neighbours of Papua New Guinea and Timor. One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap. The family spend time at the beach and Karen celebrates her fourth birthday.</p>\n<p>Scenes of the Melbourne Zoo show the difference in standards for zoological practices between the 1960s and contemporary practices.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:23:00 view of houses in the arid setting of Alice Springs<br />\n00:01:15:00 mountain scenery seen across the scrubby desert<br />\n00:01:49:00 memorial for ‘Flynn of the Inland’<br />\n00:02:22:00 Dorothy wearing a very 1960s style ‘sunsuit’ for hot weather<br />\n00:02:30:00 children playing in a portable backyard swimming pool<br />\n00:03:16:00 views of rocks and a creek followed by Alice Springs township from a higher vantage point<br />\n00:04:50:00 (faint) carvings on a rock face<br />\n00:05:15:00 ‘John Flynn Church’<br />\n00:05:25:00 cars in Alice Springs<br />\n00:05:56:00 Karen wearing sunglasses<br />\n00:06:40:00 views around an Indigenous settlement<br />\n00:07:11:00 children eating watermelon<br />\n00:07:28:00 floods in the outback<br />\n00:07:45:00 TAA (Trans Australian Airlines) airplane on the tarmac at an outback airport<br />\n00:07:53:00 propeller of flying plane and views of the sea and land below, followed by landing scenes<br />\n00:08:51:00 scenes of baby Stuart at home in Herne Hill, Geelong<br />\n00:09:50:00 baby Stuart in a ‘bouncinette’ and in his ‘bassinette’<br />\n00:11:55:00 Les and Karen with baby Stuart<br />\n00:12:42:00 Dorothy in a Ford ‘Cortina’ model car<br />\n00:13:29:00 scenes at the beach<br />\n00:14:03:00 Karen and companion buried in the sand at the beach<br />\n00:15:48:00 scenes at the Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:16:33:00 Karen’s fourth birthday celebrations<br />\n00:17:13:00 baby Stuart almost crawling across the carpet<br />\n00:18:08:00 Karen shows a popular activity of the time – the &#8216;hula hoop&#8217;<br />\n00:18:45:00 Stuart in a crate on the back of a bicycle<br />\n00:18:47:00 Karen shows off her &#8216;cowgirl&#8217; outfit<br />\n00:19:17:00 baby Stuart walking<br />\n00:19:31:00 Karen and baby brother Stuart on a tricycle (trike)<br />\n00:21:00:00 baby Stuart walking with a toy lawn mower, on his tricycle and with Karen showing off a new outfit<br />\n00:21:37:00 at the beach and in the water<br />\n00:22:21:00 Dorothy and the children in new outfits in red and orange<br />\n00:23:06:00 late 1960s or early 1970s wedding<br />\n00:23:28:00 Les in 1970s style shorts and long socks<br />\n00:24:04:00 a &#8216;Victa&#8217; brand lawn mower<br />\n00:25:30:00 garden scenes<br />\n00:25:40:00 a cricket game</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 2]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Dorothy Nixon and Les Nixon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1966</p>", "description": "<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking.

Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, titled &#8216;Just Roaming&#8217;, Ted tells the story of a road trip through Victoria. The Parsons travel through Mount Hotham and Myrtleford, down to Melbourne and then back through Bairnsdale and Paynesville on the south coast.</p>\n<p>A feature is the footage of the Gliding Club of Victoria, including female pilots, and historic buildings in Melbourne such as the Shrine of Remembrance and Ormond College at the University of Melbourne.

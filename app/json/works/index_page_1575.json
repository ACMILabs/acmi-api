Cast includes Angela Punch-McGregor and Arthur Dignam. Music composed by Peter Best (Awards: AFI Award 1982 Gary Hansen for cinematography.).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:09:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Australia, Central", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Australia, Northern", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Children", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Northern Territory", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Treatment", "Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Cattle stations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Northern Territory", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - History", "History&nbsp;→ Frontier and pioneer life", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Northern Territory"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 966141, "name": "Igor Auzins", "creator_id": 19109, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 966140, "name": "John B Murray", "creator_id": 12693, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 966139, "name": "Greg Tepper", "creator_id": 81404, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 966138, "name": "Film Corporation of Western Australia", "creator_id": 22326, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 966137, "name": "Adams Packer Films", "creator_id": 21274, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 966136, "name": "Umbrella Entertainment", "creator_id": 23506, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20711, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/iWbrg35pbvkaE6Ziw35Zu5GJgTI.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "We of the never never   (Igor Auzins) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1108, "height": 1536, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53837", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [35127]}, {"id": 88003, "acmi_id": "44735", "title": "We need to talk: employer/employee communication", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "we-need-to-talk-employeremployee-communication", "creator_credit": "Nicholas & Smith", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1996", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This business management resource has been designed by professionals with people management experience in a variety of industries including finance, manufacturing, hospitality and information services.

As played by Charlton Heston (as the painter) and Rex Harrison (as the Pope), the men are both titanic egoists determined to leave eternity a unique vision of their love and faith for God. Though &#8220;the Agony and the Ecstasy&#8221; betrays an earlier era&#8217;s reluctance to deal with either Michelangelo&#8217;s ambivalent sexuality, or the Pope&#8217;s lustful material excesses, the emotionally violent duels between the men betray the deep extremes of hatred, jealousy and love which dominated their relationship.

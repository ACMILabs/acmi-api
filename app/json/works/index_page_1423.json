He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter, Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This short film takes a quick look at a family home where we see a 1940s style ute, which can then be seen on a trip to Goulburn in New South Wales.

The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains snippets of scenes from travels around Victoria. Firstly the Hume Dam (formerly Hume Weir) which is a major dam across the Murray River in New South Wales. Constructed between 1919 and 1936 and involving hydro-power as well as flood mitigation and irrigation, the Hume Dam would have been a major attraction at the time, the 1940s. There are also some scenes of the family children during what seems to be a stop along the way.</p>\n<p>This very short black and white film is faded throughout.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:24:00 a man in suit and hat clambering over large boulders and looking out at a view<br />\n00:00:45:00 the spillway drains at the Hume Dam<br />\n00:01:05:00 children smiling at the camera while standing near a car<br />\n00:01:17:00 one of the children holds what might be a small rabbit or possum</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values":

Parsons Home Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 16mm AGFA film. George Robinson (Robin) Parsons was an amateur filmmaker who made home movies on a Bolex camera during the period 1929 to 1938. The home movies show life in Melbourne and regional Victoria in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>This film shows an example of life in Victoria, Australia, just prior to the Second World War. Much of it revolves around members of the Parsons family and friends who are clearly not camera shy. In a number of scenes, you can see individuals playing up to the camera. There is even a staged boxing match on the beach where Robin (George Robinson) Parsons experimented with using special effects.</p>\n<p>The film shows several Victorian locations including Melbourne, Dromana, Rosebud Aerodrome, Cape Schanck, Mt Hotham, Mallacoota, Wangarrata and Yallourn. Dromana Beach is featured a few times and appears to be a family favourite for swimming and family gatherings.</p>\n<p>This film is rich with fashion of the period, both casual and formal, including two weddings of different periods and golfing attire.</p>\n<p>Included in the film is the 1935 centennial celebrations parade showing crowded street with brass bands travelling down Collins Street, including a brief scene of an Aboriginal float. Much of these scenes are taken from the rooftop of Parsons Bros and company building. The company would later form Uncle Toby’s.</p>\n<p>The film also includes the Shrine of Remembrance, St Pauls cathedral, Princes Bridge and many other Melbourne landmarks including some buildings and sites that no longer exist.</p>\n<p>Of interest are the many forms of transport that are seen throughout which include cars, trams, horses, bicycles, motor bike with side carriage, a canoe, bi planes, fighter planes, a gyrocopter, the Saro A17 Cutty Sark seaplane (only 12 were ever created), transport planes, steamboats, tugboats, a navy ship, locomotives and a Melbourne ferry.</p>\n<p>Also of interest is a scene from the 1939 Australian Championship at Kooyong Stadium with John Bromwich and Adrian Quist.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List<br />\n00:00:02:00 – Geoffrey and Jean Parsons playing with a Fox Terrier<br />\n00:01:12:00 – Wedding of Mary Dowling Woods and John Bedggood<br />\n00:02:07:00 – Melbourne Grammar Sports day at the MCG<br />\n00:03:52:00 – The Rose family, Aeneas Gunn and Robin Parsons at the Rose family home with dogs<br />\n00:05:10:00 – Doug Rose and Aeneas Gunn riding a cow<br />\n00:07:34:00 – Steam boat on the Yarra River<br />\n00:07:48:00 – Parson family and friends swimming at Dromana beach showing 1930’s swimming costumes<br />\n00:08:44:00 Sidney and Susannah Parsons at Dromana Beach<br />\n00:09:53:00 – Parsons family doing Acrobats, playing games and making a human tower at Dromana Beach<br />\n00:10:55:00 – Bi Planes – VH–UHR, VH-UHS and VH-UAT<br />\n00:12:23:00 – Two women and Geoffrey Parsons on a rug in the garden of the family home<br />\n00:14:01:00 – Susannah Parsons demonstrating her golfing swing<br />\n00:14:52:00 – View of Princes bridge with Flinders Street Railway station in the Background<br />\n00:15:20:00 – View towards the Flinders street Fish Market (demolished in 1956)<br />\n00:15:26:00 – Steam boats docked on the Yarra river.<br />\n00:15:46:00 – Navy ship in the harbour<br />\n00:16:06:00 – The shrine of Remembrance (before the gardens were there) and views of Melbourne from its balcony.<br />\n00:21:28:00 – View of Collins Street from the roof of the Parson Bros Mill near Spencer street station, showing the 1935 centennial celebrations parade<br />\n00:22:45:00 – Sidney Parsons, Robin Parsons and unknown man playing golf<br />\n00:23:56:00 - View from the rooftop of Parsons Bros Mill on Collins Street looking up towards the Victorian Railway administration offices on Spencer street and down Flinders Lane.<br />\n00:24:20:00 – People lining Nicholson street (near parliament gardens) to watch lavish floats and masked performers.<br />\n00:30:56:00 – Parson family members at the beach in Dromana<br />\n00:37:24:00 – Doug and Charlie Parsons climbing the sign labelled the highest house in Australia at Hotham Heights and camping trip<br />\n00:42:30:00 – Front view of motorbike with side car following on the road in wet weather<br />\n00:27:23:00 – Parson brothers, friends and fiancée Jean, on the coast of Cape Shanck.<br />\n00:42:59:00 – Jean Parsons (portrait view)<br />\n00:43:03:00 – Robin Parsons (portrait view) smoking<br />\n00:43:18:00 – 1939 Australian Championship, Kooyong Stadium – John Bromwich and Adrian Quist<br />\n00:43:56:00 – Wedding of unknown couple<br />\n00:44:42:00 – VH-USQ Cierva C.30A Auto gyro (Gyrocopter)<br />\n00:46:37:00 – The Saro A17 Cutty Sark seaplane off Dromana Beach.

George Robinson (Robin) Parsons was an amateur filmmaker who made home movies on a Bolex camera during the period 1929 to 1938. The home movies show life in Melbourne and regional Victoria in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>This film shows an example of life in Victoria, Australia, just prior to the Second World War. Much of it revolves around members of the Parsons family and friends who are clearly not camera shy. In a number of scenes, you can see individuals playing up to the camera. There is even a staged boxing match on the beach where Robin (George Robinson) Parsons experimented with using special effects.</p>\n<p>The film shows several Victorian locations including Melbourne, Dromana, Rosebud Aerodrome, Cape Schanck, Mt Hotham, Mallacoota, Wangarrata and Yallourn.

It is the story of the Heidelberg School of artists, written by Bill Garner and based on an original idea by Humphrey McQueen. Episode one begins with Tom Roberts, painter and photographer, born in Dorset, England in 1856. Tom Roberts arrived in Geelong in 1869 and settled in Collingwood (Melbourne) where he became a member of the Victorian Academy of Arts. The Academy was conservative and frowned upon the idea of &#8220;Australian&#8221; art, professional women artists or the new form of Impressionism. As an artist Tom Roberts became obsessed with painting the bush landscape; Jane Sutherland wanted equal rights for women artists - together and along with several other Melbourne artists including Fred McCubbin, Clara Southern, Arthur Streeton, all members of the Academy, a breakaway group was formed and became known as the Australian Artists Association. Features several images of the works of Roberts, McCubbin and Streeton and Melbourne locale including bush and bayside beach scenes. Cast includes Chris Hallam (Tom Roberts), Michele Fawdon (Jane Sutherland), Phil Sumner (Fred McCubbin), Huw Williams (Arthur Streeton), Nina Landis (Clara Southern), Ian McFadyen (Theodore Fink).</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>One summer again.

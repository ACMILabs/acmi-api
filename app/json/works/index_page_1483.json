is a successful six month community arts project that was documented on video. The project brought together schools, community groups, artists, people from culturally diverse backgrounds and local government, including over 80 students, 10 storytellers, and 14 artists/mentors. &#8216;Roar culture&#8217; explores issues of identity concerning ethnic, religious &amp; sexual discrimination, cultural diversity and tolerance.<br />\nIn doing so, it was critical to the process that there was a space for understanding and insight: a space where the many faces and voices which contribute to Bendigo&#8217;s historical and contemporary image and identity, were paid attention.<br />\nStage one: the project&#8217;s starting point was the narrative or story. Stories from 10 multicultural &amp; indigenous individuals whose memories ranged from the 1930s through to today, from places and countries which hauntingly navigated us to Bendigo. Each told a different story about living in regional Victoria however the threads of isolation, language difficulties, fragmented families and broader cultural or religious differences provided significant links.<br />\nStage two was a mentor program, which furthered the developed the artistic skills of the students through a variety of cultural &amp; arts mediums.

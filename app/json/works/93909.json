The program&#8217;s style makes the avant garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew MacKenzie deviates from the program&#8217;s usual format to incorporate an in-depth interview with English artist, art critic, writer and television producer, Matthew Collings on the eve of his Australian lecture tour, 2002. Collings provides a refreshing and challenging outlook on contemporary art and provides contextual observation on contemporary art values and practice. Collings is best known for the BBC series &#8216;This is Modern Art&#8217; and his book &#8216;Crazy Nation&#8217; amongst others.

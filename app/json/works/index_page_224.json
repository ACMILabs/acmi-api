Rather than a straight-forward narrative, we are taken through the geography and landscapes of the country and are witness to four stories that illustrate the harshness of pre-revolutionary Cuba.

A militant student is persecuted by Batista&#8217;s police. A peasant who is initially suspicious of the revolution takes up arms when the military destroy his home and family. The intent is clearly propagandanistic: the film is an essay on the necessity of revolutionary war. But whatever the melodramatic flourishes of the Marxist exegesis, what makes &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; a rivetting work is the operatic force of the movie making and the terrific musical score by Carlos Farinas. Influenced by Eistenstein&#8217;s never completed &#8220;Che Viva Mexico&#8221;, Kalatozov&#8217;s mise-en-scene has the fluid power and musical grace of silent cinema. From the opening sequence where the camera flies across the island, to a stunning tracking shot of a man navigating his canoe through a village perched on water, to the final rousing march of the revolutionaries descending from the hills, the film is an intoxicating series of marvellous choreographed set pieces. Though Mikhail&#8217;s influences are clearly those of silent cinema, the score and soundtrack to &#8220;I Am Cuba&#8221; is also equally powerful, experimental and emotionally rich. The film has been neglected for decades and dismissed as Soviet-era kitsch but it was re-discovered by Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola who have been responsible for its re-release (a not insignificant act of artistic heroism considering the powerful might of the right-wing Cuban-American political lobby in the USA). It is certainly florid and melodramatic but the propaganda is not hard to take - not when it is so sumptuously presented and not when, as the four narrative sequences make abundantly clear, the causes for revolution are ethically and economically justified.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Russian", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cuba", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Capitalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Imperialism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Student movements", "Experimental", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Cuba", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Soviet Union", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Castro, Fidel, 1927-", "History&nbsp;→ Cuba - History - Revolution - 1959", "History&nbsp;→ Propaganda", "History&nbsp;→ Revolutions", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery", "History&nbsp;→ Student movements", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music, Cuban", "People&nbsp;→ Castro, Fidel, 1927-", "People&nbsp;→ Yevtushenko, Yevgeny Aleksandrovich, 1933-", "Places&nbsp;→ Cuba"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/i-am-cuba", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1973256, "name": "Mikhail Kalatozov", "creator_id": 33453, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q324937", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973255, "name": "Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industrias Cinematográficos (ICAIC)", "creator_id": 30221, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1973254, "name": "Mosfilm", "creator_id": 4199, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49695", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 199, "name": "Cuba", "slug": "cuba"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [31756], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92265, "acmi_id": "315493", "title": "Jules and Jim = Jules et Jim [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jules-and-jim-jules-et-jim-dvd", "creator_credit": "Francois Truffaut, Marcel Berbert, SEDIF and Les Films du Carrosse", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1962", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1962-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The story of a menage-a-trois in the years around World War I is distanced by the narrator who makes the viewer continually aware of the artifice involved in its telling.

David Wiener (Csongor Kassai) is the son of a Jewish family who own the business in which Josef (Bolek Polivka) and Horst (Jaroslav Dusek) work. The Wieners are taken to the death camps of Poland but David manages to escape and find his way back to his Czech home. He finds a population cowered into subservience and suspicion from the years of Nazi occupation. But the childless Josef, and his wife, Marie (Anna Siskova), take in the fugitive David and hide him in their pantry.

And then, as if a miracle, Marie falls pregnant! The strength of &#8220;Divided we fall&#8221; is that in the midst of modern European history&#8217;s darkest tragedies, the director Jan Hrebejk, is able to create a humane comedy in which questions of loyalty and forgiveness loom much larger than desires for retribution and revenge. There is a revisionism undoubtedly at work in the film: the Resistance is purged of Communism and the Czechs are always the unwilling dupes of the Germans. But for the bumbling, foolish humans at the centre of &#8220;Divided we fall&#8221;, politics is never a consideration.

The strength of &#8220;Divided we fall&#8221; is that in the midst of modern European history&#8217;s darkest tragedies, the director Jan Hrebejk, is able to create a humane comedy in which questions of loyalty and forgiveness loom much larger than desires for retribution and revenge. There is a revisionism undoubtedly at work in the film: the Resistance is purged of Communism and the Czechs are always the unwilling dupes of the Germans. But for the bumbling, foolish humans at the centre of &#8220;Divided we fall&#8221;, politics is never a consideration. Universalism and humanism are the driving forces behind the ethics of this film. Nominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 2001 Academy Awards.

David Wiener (Csongor Kassai) is the son of a Jewish family who own the business in which Josef (Bolek Polivka) and Horst (Jaroslav Dusek) work. The Wieners are taken to the death camps of Poland but David manages to escape and find his way back to his Czech home. He finds a population cowered into subservience and suspicion from the years of Nazi occupation. But the childless Josef, and his wife, Marie (Anna Siskova), take in the fugitive David and hide him in their pantry. Horst, whose social standing has increased due to his collaboration with the Germans, is a constant visitor at Josef and Marie&#8217;s, and their attempts to hide David from him bring a rich vein of humour to the film.

Exotic and enticing, more a visual feast than a dramatic quest, the film may challenge viewers&#8217; notions of parenting, self-fulfilment and ultimately love. Some may just love the exotic travelogue nature that is the background of the Moroccan location. Soundtrack includes some memorable hits from the British charts of the 1960s/70s. The two performers in the roles of the daughters are captivating - eight year old Bea (Bella Riza) and six year old Lucy (Carrie Mullan) who are tired of mum&#8217;s adventures and just want to be &#8216;normal&#8217;.

Grant, Tom Hollander, Derek Jacobi, Kelly Macdonald, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, Ryan Phillippe, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson and James Wilby.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Great Britain - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Manners and customs", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Aristocracy (Social class)", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Manners and customs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Wealth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998779, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55163", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998778, "name": "David Levy", "creator_id": 80629, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998777, "name": "Robert Altman", "creator_id": 1660, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55163", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998776, "name": "Bob Balaban", "creator_id": 80201, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998775, "name": "Sandcastle 5 Productions", "creator_id": 35987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998774, "name": "Zestwick Limited", "creator_id": 35986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998773, "name": "Film Council", "creator_id": 35985, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998772, "name": "Capitol Films", "creator_id": 29576, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998771, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51943", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33583], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94075, "acmi_id": "317847", "title": "Cats & dogs = Cats and dogs [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "cats-dogs-cats-and-dogs-dvd", "creator_credit": "Lawrence Guterman, Craig Perry, Warren Zide, Chris DeFaria, Andrew Lazar and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A young beagle finds himself a player in a canines versus felines war when he is introduced to the Brody family.

The idea, which began as a Stiller skit in 1996, is teased into a feature length film. The story centres on Derek Zoolander (Stiller) - a famous male model, three-time winner of model of the year and creator of several iconic looks including Le Tigre and Blue steel. Derek&#8217;s reign is threatened by the rise of Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson) a male model whose freewheeling attitude makes him hotter than the 90s flavoured Derek. The plot centres on rivalry between the two models and the assassination of the Malaysian Prime Minister, whose new anti-child labour laws threatens the lucrative fashion trade. &#8220;Zoolander&#8221; satirises modelling, beauty, the cult of celebrity, nightclubs, MTV and VH1 type of fashion awards. One of the sharpest sequences in the film is a &#8216;walk-off&#8217; between the two models, judged by none other than David Bowie. Numerous film references are peppered throughout including - 2001: A Space odyssey, the X-Files, the Manchurian candidate and Trading places. Cast includes: Jerry Stiller, David Duchovny, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor and Will Ferrell, with cameos by Billy Zane, Wynona Ryder, Donald Trump, Christina Slater, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani and Donatella Versace.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962710, "name": "VH1 Films", "creator_id": 35435, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962709, "name": "Ben Stiller", "creator_id": 72225, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962708, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962707, "name": "Ben Stiller", "creator_id": 72225, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962706, "name": "Village Roadshow Pictures", "creator_id": 838, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962705, "name": "Scott Rudin", "creator_id": 71411, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962703, "name": "Stuart Cornfeld", "creator_id": 26912, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962704, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20043, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/3ihaCjYmQ1vIh6PNvlZ2rdBRSak.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Zoolander  (Ben Stiller) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51222", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33107]}, {"id": 98073, "acmi_id": "56304", "title": "Zookeepers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "zookeepers", "creator_credit": "Dugan Rosalini and Dugan Rosalini Film Associates", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1981", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>An informative and accurate depiction of the behind-the-scenes activities of a zoo, showing the care and feeding of animals and hygiene practices.

MUSIC IN THE WOODS: Timothy and the special animals spend a day in the woods collecting feathers. As a precaution against any animals getting lost, they take their musical instruments to play if they get lost in the woods. In the woods they meet a new friend, the Parrot, but they soon realise that Little Mut is missing. THE ANIMAL GARDEN: The animals are given their own garden to look after by Timothy. Nothing seems to be growing, until Woeful and Gumpa decide to help things along. WOEFUL AND THE WASPBERRIES: The animals decide to organise a surprise birthday picnic for Timothy and they are all caught up in the preparations, except for Woeful who has forgotten all about Timothy&#8217;s birthday. Luckily he has an idea for a present, but it&#8217;s an idea that will lead him into all sorts of trouble.

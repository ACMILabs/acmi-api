Simon comes across the enigma hidden in a puzzle magazine (an orchestrated move by the NSA who designed MERCURY and wanted to test their brainchild out on real people), and when he calls for the prize triggers an alarm at the National Security Agency. NSA Chief Nicholas Kudrow (Alec Baldwin) hires an assassin to kill Simon, believing this is the only way to stop the threat to national security. The only hope Simon has for survival lies with renegade FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce Willis), a man willing to protect the emotionally unpredictable child who has no-one else to turn to when ruthless Federal agents are out to get him. The task will take Jeffries muscle power and Simon&#8217;s special ability to be successful. Based on the novel &#8220;Simple Simon&#8221; by Ryne Douglas Pearson.

First performed in Adelaide and then toured to Tokyo, the workshop and rehearsals that culminated in the abridged version of Macbeth in the form of a &#8220;visualisation of MacBeth&#8217;s inner world in all its turmoil&#8221; are presented in this documentary in excerpts along with discussion of the methods of its realisation from a technical, acting and experiential point of view.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Japan", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Japanese - Australia", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Drama - Study and teaching", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Acting", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Acting - Drama", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Acting - Technique", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors - Australia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors - Australia - Interviews", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Drama - Study and teaching", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Drama - Themes, motives", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Movement (Acting)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater - Production and direction", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theatrical producers and directors", "People&nbsp;→ Suzuki, Tadashi, 1939-", "Places&nbsp;→ Japan", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 913418, "name": "Australia.

A story set in England in 1192 of a Saxon knight who returns from the crusades to find that life is not the same as as before he left. His beloved - the fair Rowena - is now engaged to Athelstane Prince of the Saxons, his father has disowned him therefore he has no inheritance and his honour is besmirched by false rumours about his actions in Palestine. All these trials he needs to overcome, at the same time as he attempts to save the lovely Jewess, Rebecca, from the hands of a misguided Norman knight who feels that his soul is in peril by loving her. A great adventure story of knights, quests, chivalry, courage, honour, sword- fights and a love story to boot.

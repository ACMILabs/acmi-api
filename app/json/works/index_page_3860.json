It advocates for recognition of the inestimable value of the rich and varied resources of natural forests, and argues that the preservation of those that remain must become a global responsibility and not another burden on those nations least able to afford it.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Conservation of natural resources", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Conservation of natural resources - Australia", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Ecology - Australia", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Forest ecology", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 798348, "name": "Shell", "creator_id": 12254, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44737", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [27495]}, {"id": 92064, "acmi_id": "315258", "title": "Hidden faces", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hidden-faces", "creator_credit": "Claire Hunt and Kim Longinotto", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A fascinating documentary about Egyptian women&#8217;s lives in contemporary Muslim society and the effects of Islam on their lives.

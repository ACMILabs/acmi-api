The film ends with a short summing up of the importance of work done by research scientists and chemists who are constantly studying the constituents of water.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:44:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Water", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Water - Analysis", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Water", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Water - Analysis", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemical elements", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemical processes", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemical reactions", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Chemistry - Research", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Methodology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientists", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 876906, "name": "ICI (GB)", "creator_id": 15916, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 876907, "name": "Gaumont-British Instructional", "creator_id": 12382, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47572", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1940", "notes": "Estimated date", "to_year": "1940"}], "labels": [29836]}, {"id": 86784, "acmi_id": "308483", "title": "Water", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "water", "creator_credit": "United Nations Environment Programme, Dick Young Productions and Dick Young", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Shows the importance of water in man&#8217;s existence in all parts of the world, including Africa, India and Asia.

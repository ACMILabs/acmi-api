In Loup, commemorating the year of the life of the ocean, the dancers, through improvised movements, developed their vision towards a common destination - the sea. Its openness and vastness, power and force depict the energy of freedom that eliminates all barriers. Barriers that may arise from disabilities are suddenly irrelevant.<br />\nLoup was filmed at the Jawbone site in the Wetlands in Williamstown. This is a protected conservation area and is used as a metaphor to represent the dancers&#8217; expectation of a safe and open space in which to be, and express freely.<br />\nAfter a decade of regular dance workshops and performances, the artists naturally progressed into a new stage &#8216; exploration of dance with media.

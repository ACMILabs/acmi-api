The film&#8217;s lead protagonist Ari (Alex Dimitriades) is an angry, confused, nihilistic, unemployed 19-year-old Greek Australian. The film traces a particularly explosive 24 hours in his life, fuelled by drugs, booze and anonymous sex as he grapples with his sexuality and clashes with his traditional Greek family, who he views with equal amounts of respect and contempt. Performances are excellent throughout, in particular Paul Capsis as Ari&#8217;s defiant crossdressing friend Johnny/Toula. </p>\n<p>Cast includes Elena Mandalis, Eugenia Fragos, Julian Garner, Dora Kaskanis, Alex Papps, Damien Fotiou. <b>Awards:</b> Best Actor (Alex Dimitriades) and Best Supporting Actor (Paul Capsis) for the 1999 Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards. </p>\n<p>Best Feature Film Adaptation (Andrew Bovell, Ana Kokkinos, Mira Robertson) 1998 Awgie Awards. </p>\n<p>Best Director (Ana Kokkinos) 1999 San Francisco Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. </p>\n<p>Best Achievement in Editing (Jill Bilcock) 1998 AFI Awards.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Youth", "Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Greeks - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Emigration and immigration", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Social conditions - 20th Century", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Greeks - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immigrants - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Coming out (Sexual orientation)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestites", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth - Drug use - Australia", "Literature&nbsp;→ Australian literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 20}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956419, "name": "Head On Productions", "creator_id": 29753, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956420, "name": "Jane Scott", "creator_id": 19966, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956421, "name": "Ana Kokkinos", "creator_id": 8642, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956418, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44273", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27217]}]}

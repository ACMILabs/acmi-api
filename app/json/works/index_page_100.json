The name of the secret group is the Kunlun Column. Their plan is to divide their forces into four separate groups, sending Mao with one of them in an attempt to relocate him to a safer location.

They include trips to Lake Eildon and the Eildon Weir Spillway and Dromana Beach. Streets of Ballarat and Alexandra are also briefly seen.</p>\n<p>We see a doubles tennis tournament at Kooyong Stadium and a scene of the 1936 Australian golf exhibition tour with Gene Sarazen (USA), Jim Ferrier (Australia) and Helen Hicks (USA), the first professional female golfer in the world.</p>\n<p>Included are members of the Parsons family, also playing tennis and golf, and towards the end of the film there is a raquet technique demonstration from Robin (George Robinson) Parsons himself.</p>\n<p>In addition to showing fashions of the time there are brief scenes showing vehicles of the era, including a steam locomotive, ships, a row boat and horses. The two main vehicles seen are the family cars: a 1935 Chevrolet and 1933 Rover.</p>\n<p>The film also includes a few scenes of dogs playing and doing tricks including the family terrier called Peter.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:08:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1487519, "name": "George Parsons", "creator_id": 84854, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444;

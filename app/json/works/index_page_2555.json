The struggle and resolution toward compromise seen in the film provide an allegorical summary of the conflict and disillusionment felt by people leading up to the economic and social reforms of the 1980s, where there was widespread poverty and unease. It particularly touches on the disillusionment of big promises delivered too little, too late.<br />\nThe previous brands in the film are &#8220;high quality, cheap and durable,&#8221; which illustrates metaphorically how the fabric of Chinese society is changing, yet the people still maintain their integrity and are able to live in harmony. In hindsight, the current controversies regarding hazardous and unreliable products coming out of China throw the textile metaphor in an ironic light that was wholly unintended by the filmmakers of the day.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; December 15, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:08:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Industries - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Village communities - China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Economic conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - Cultural Revolution, 1966-1969", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889848, "name": "Guangxi Film Studio", "creator_id": 33557, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889849, "name": "Guo Baochang", "creator_id": 82468, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889850, "name": "Ji Hongxu", "creator_id": 82469, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889851, "name": "Guo Baochang", "creator_id": 82468, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889852, "name": "Yang Baoming", "creator_id": 82470, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889853, "name": "Zhang Jie", "creator_id": 82471, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889854, "name": "He Ling", "creator_id": 82472, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889855, "name": "Chang Wenzhi", "creator_id": 82473, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889856, "name": "Shi Weijian", "creator_id": 82474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146419", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [55267], "external_references": []}]}

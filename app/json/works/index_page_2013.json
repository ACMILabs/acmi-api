The electric rock score includes original music by Mick Jagger, The Last Poets and Ry Cooder.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - Great Britain", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/performance", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2614933, "name": "Donald Cammell", "creator_id": 77649, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q975488", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2614934, "name": "Nicolas Roeg", "creator_id": 69531, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51541", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2614932, "name": "Sanford Lieberson", "creator_id": 26490, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16104490", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2614931, "name": "Goodtime Enterprises", "creator_id": 26489, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5583638", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2614930, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2614929, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40511", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [24048]}]}

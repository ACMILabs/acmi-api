Teaming up with producer Val Lewton for the third time, director Jacques Tourneur has fashioned an eerie, economical and atmospheric film noir thriller. Based on the Cornell Woolrich novel &#8220;Black Alibi&#8221;, &#8216;The Leopard man&#8217; utilizes to great effect, a subtle, moody soundtrack and expressionistic lighting to suggest rather than show, proving that the imagination can sometimes be more terrifying. Like their previous collaboration&#8217;s &#8216;Cat People&#8217; (1942) and &#8216;I Walked with a Zombie&#8217; (1943), the film is made up of a series of chilling set pieces that unnerve and linger rather than shock in their disquieting tone and atmosphere. Cast includes Margo, Dennis O&#8217;Keefe, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell and James Bell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Circus animals", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Leopards", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus animals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961008, "name": "Jacques Tourneur", "creator_id": 77041, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961007, "name": "Val Lewton", "creator_id": 77040, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961006, "name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "creator_id": 71465, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961005, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19677, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g6TH86P6JwFmGh4Zvyct4gq2AkI.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Leopard man (Jacques Tourneur) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50178", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1943", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1943"}], "labels": [32174]}]}

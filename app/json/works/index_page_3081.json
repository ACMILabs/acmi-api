With no job and dependent on her rich maiden aunt for a daily allowance, from whom she hopes to receive an inheritance, Lily mistakenly asks Gus Trenor for some assistance. This act of borrowing only leads to further complications, involving the cunning Mr. Rosedale, that entangle Lily and limit her options. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; charts Lily&#8217;s progressive defeat and the suffering she endures as she loses her name and, concomitantly, social respect. Alone and ostracised, Lily&#8217;s finale is a monumental passage in the film. &#8220;The House of Mirth&#8221; is a tragic tale about a woman who tries desperately to both be true to her heart and play by society&#8217;s rules. But she can&#8217;t have both and ultimately ends up with nothing at all. New York upper class society is a character unto itself throughout his film - a conservative and rigid set of attitudes, sentiments, and values that have the power to do terrible evil. Stars Gillian Anderson, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia, Eric Stoltz, Eleanor Bron, Laura Linney.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social classes", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social conflict", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social influence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social values", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "History&nbsp;→ Women - Suffrage - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Romanticism in literature", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997691, "name": "Terence Davies", "creator_id": 26311, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q773523", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997690, "name": "Olivia Stewart", "creator_id": 35168, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q95755303", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997689, "name": "Three Rivers", "creator_id": 35167, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50993", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32935]}, {"id": 93402, "acmi_id": "316830", "title": "Way down east [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "way-down-east-dvd", "creator_credit": "D.W.

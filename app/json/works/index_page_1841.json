Over 170,000 refugee Saharawis live in camps established in the harsh barren desert of Southwestern Algeria. In 1992 the United Nations attempted to sponsor a referendum for the Saharawis to vote for their future in Western Sahara - asking whether the Saharawis wished to remain a part of Morocco or rule themselves.

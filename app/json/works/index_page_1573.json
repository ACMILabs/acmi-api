She&#8217;s frightened of trees that wither and die, frightened of shadow and light, frightened of giving herself up to her dreams and memories. When a clairvoyant describes, minutely, the man of her life, Kay abruptly interrupts the constant stream of monogamous relationships which had been her pattern, to set up home with Louis, the ex-boyfriend of a colleague. After a year of apparent happiness, her fears are rekindled, she turns away from Louis and withdraws inexorably into herself. that&#8217;s when her sister, Sweetie, appears. Sweetie is impulsive and untidy, a fat adolescent who, her father believes, is the artist of the family. She loses no time in turning Kay&#8217;s ordered world upside down with her capricious demands, voracious sensuality, enormous appetite and terrifying rages.

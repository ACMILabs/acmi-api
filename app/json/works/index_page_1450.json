King George the Third, after he lost the American colonies in the War of Independence, succumbed to intermittent bouts of madness where his usual ordered and calm persona underwent a violent and obscene transformation. The Prince of Wales becomes a willing pawn in the plot to commit the King, and establish the Regency. This is a finely acted and sumptuous production of Bennett&#8217;s play. Ian Holm plays the Doctor called in to cure the King&#8217;s madness using methods which from a modern vantage were brutal and inhumane.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Great Britain - History - 18th century", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-madness-of-king-george", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1990007, "name": "Ken Adam", "creator_id": 72649, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production designer", "role_id": 966, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990006, "name": "Nicholas Hytner", "creator_id": 47209, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q967302", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990005, "name": "David Parfitt", "creator_id": 54946, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990004, "name": "Stephen Evans", "creator_id": 77731, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990003, "name": "Close Call Film Production", "creator_id": 27568, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1990002, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41553", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [25046], "external_references": [{"id": 24333, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q581501"}]}, {"id": 83117, "acmi_id": "304311", "title": "The Long Good Friday", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-long-good-friday", "creator_credit": "John Mackenzie, Barry Hanson, Calendar and HandMade Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In the savage and deadly world of gangland kings, the man at the top is the ruler, only for as long as he controls everything in his territory.

The pacifist captain (Klaus Maria Brandauer), is a German-American who is haunted by an event in his naval past when he was indirectly responsible for the deaths at sea of some sailors during WWII. When he rescues a drifting speedboat from an impending storm, he is confronted by a trio of modern day pirates led by the menacing, psychotic Caspary (played in a no-holds-barred performance by Robert Duvall), on their way to pick up illicit cargo. From the moment they board the lightship the thugs attempt to take control, resulting in a violent struggle between good and evil. With the atmosphere becoming increasingly tense and hostile, conflicts arise amongst the crew as their misguided attempts at heroism end tragically.

The latter, chanted to a mesmerizing musical score by Tibor Szemzo, form a haunting aural counterpoint to the richly textured images of this intimate and eloquent documentary.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hungary"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 728811, "name": "Peter Forgacs", "creator_id": 6357, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "695", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 25, "name": "Hungary", "slug": "hungary"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [47825], "external_references": []}, {"id": 108331, "acmi_id": "B1002331", "title": "Father and his three sons: the Bartos family", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "father-and-his-three-sons-the-bartos-family", "creator_credit": "Peter Forgacs", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Hungary, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Zoltan Bartos, an amateur filmmaker and composer of popular dance music made home movies between the end of the 1920s and the middle of the 1950s.</p>\n<p>The Bartos family present themselves in a semi-formal way to Zoltan&#8217;s camera; children dance in national costume, young wives smile and wave, relatives act out slapstick routines in imitation of &#8216;the movies&#8217; and solemn groups pay their respects at the cemetary.

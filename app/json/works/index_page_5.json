Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film presents a glimpse of a somewhat nostalgic version of Australian suburban family life as it was in the 50s and early 60s.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:07:00 children playing with sprinkler and toys 1950s<br />\n00:02:19:00 leaving hospital with baby<br />\n00:03:39:00 a 1950s Christmas scene; children with toys<br />\n00:04:59:00 brief shot of Queenscliff with kids riding in Cobb &amp; Co. horse-drawn carriage<br />\n00:06:53:00 girl jumping on a trampoline with pier in the background – trampoline park with interesting “trampolines” sign<br />\n00:08:59:00 nice shot of toddler waddling towards the camera<br />\n00:12:54:00 backyard children’s birthday party<br />\n00:17:05:00 young girl using a hula hoop in a paddock<br />\n00:18:02:00 toddler gets a home haircut</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:07:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Birthdays", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hospitals", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parties", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1742469, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1603, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/kCaSOWAvdgo"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

installation creates a series of disquieting tableaus that present visions of three characters engaged in a game like narrative and whose roles and identities shift and blur between attacker and victim and all that could be the same in between. In an articulation of a &#8216;schizophrenic understanding of the self&#8217; Tichacek presents an image of oscillating inner world&#8217;s where physical and mental experience fluctuate and escape simple definition in the parameters of physical and emotional manipulations and violence (Exhibition proposal). In a thematic echo of and engagement with technological advancements in bodily modification, the victim, played by the artist, is submitted to a range of intrusive and physical molding actions at the hands of the other characters, set in lush outdoor settings as well as in a dark and clinical interior. Suspended in a triangular fashion and surrounding a sculptural object, the viewer can move between and behind the synchronised screens, the physical and psychological shifts of identity featured in the video mirrored in the viewer&#8217;s own fluctuating experience of the work as they become variously immersed in or distanced from the disturbingly beautiful and new but fragile &#8216;prosthetic&#8217; space the game narrative articulates.

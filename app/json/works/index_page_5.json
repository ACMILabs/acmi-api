One intelligence test attempted to determine self-awareness by seeing if the dolphins recognised themselves in a mirror.</p>\n<p>Amrita Hepi draws on that trial in &#8220;Scripture for a smokescreen: Episode 1 – dolphin house&#8221;, seemingly seducing her own image. She dances with an inflatable dolphin, attempting to communicate with it through voice and movement, paralleling the intimacy between one of the researchers, Margaret Lovatt, and a male dolphin during the experiment.</p>\n<p>Not only does Amrita lampoon the absurdity of teaching marine mammals English, she uses the study to expose the way Western knowledge systems – language, ethics and science – are imposed on people and cultures through colonisation. Through choreographed dance and moving image, Amrita explores what happens when we’re constantly under surveillance, and when assumptions about us are presented to the world through someone else’s viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Amrita Hepi is represented by Anna Schwartz Gallery</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Commissioned by ACMI and SAMSTAG</p>", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["How I See It: Blak Art and Film&nbsp;→ Zone 2"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Two-channel video installation"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 7257}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2513652, "name": "Amrita Hepi", "creator_id": 87015, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2513657, "name": "Luke Smith", "creator_id": 87017, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040132", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2513653, "name": "Zoe Theodore", "creator_id": 87016, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271273", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2513655, "name": "Anna Pogossova", "creator_id": 87018, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "art direction", "role_id": 920, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2513656, "name": "Daniel Jenatsch", "creator_id": 87019, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2513654, "name": "Luke Smith", "creator_id": 87017, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121040132", "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "190453", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2022", "notes": "", "to_year": "2022"}], "labels": [61311]}, {"id": 120000, "acmi_id": "Z000190", "title": "Ngura Pukulpa – Happy Place", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ngura-pukulpa-happy-place", "creator_credit": "Kaylene Whiskey", "credit_line": "<p>Kaylene Whiskey, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands<br />\nSingle-channel video, 8 mins<br />\nCommissioned by Melbourne Art Foundation in partnership with ACMI</p>", "headline_credit": "Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands/SA/Australia, 2021", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 3", "last_on_display_date": "2022-04-10", "is_context_indigenous": true, "material_description": "Single-channel video", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2021-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": true, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Yankunytjatjara artist Kaylene Whiskey’s signature pop culture figures fly from the canvas in her latest work, Ngura Pukulpa – Happy Place.

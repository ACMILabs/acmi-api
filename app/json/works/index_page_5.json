Elliot confounds viewer expectations offering up more extreme and vulgar outback personalities than could possibly be imagined, making these characters repugnant to watch. The film slyly sends up films such as &#8220;Crocodile Dundee&#8221; which pandered to the gross stereotypes that so appealed to audiences. Elliot however failed to appeal to anyone with this bizarre and subversive flick, receiving critical brickbats and woeful box office returns.<br />\nCast includes: Johnathon Schaech, Rod Taylor, Susie Porter,  Richard Moir, Maggie Kirkpatrick, Barry Humphries and Paul Mercurio</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Swindlers and swindling", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/welcome-to-woop-woop", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998313, "name": "Stephan Elliott", "creator_id": 728, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2094420", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998312, "name": "Finola Dwyer", "creator_id": 71846, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998311, "name": "Unthank Films", "creator_id": 35621, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998310, "name": "Film Finance Corporation Australia", "creator_id": 24532, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998309, "name": "Scala Productions", "creator_id": 35620, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51407", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [33223], "external_references": [{"id": 24461, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2902017"}]}, {"id": 87789, "acmi_id": "309872", "title": "Welcome to the dollhouse", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "welcome-to-the-dollhouse", "creator_credit": "Todd Solondz and Suburban Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Todd Solondz&#8217;s debut feature is a darkly funny and bleak tale of the trials and horrors of high school outsiders. &#8220;Welcome to the Dollhouse&#8221; exacts with excruciating and all too familiar detail the ritualistic and cut throat pecking order of a New Jersey high school.

Shot in 16mm and blown up to 35mm, it&#8217;s a subtly picaresque movie about the wanderings of a semi-destitute but aimless American woman. Directing herself, Barbara Loden manages to make the character convincing in her directionless amorality, yet gradually sympathetic and even heroic. Essentially a road-movie with an existentialist backbone, the film depicts Wanda drifting into desultory relations with a bank robber, to whom she becomes attached despite his unpredictable temper. But Wanda botches everything and fails to deliver the getaway car after getting lost in a traffic jam. The story continues with our last glimpse of her back on the road, being picked up in a bar. Similar in feel to other contemporary films, &#8220;Two-Lane Black Top&#8221; and &#8220;Killing of A Chinese Bookie&#8221;, &#8220;Wanda&#8221; refuses to provide explanation or judgement of its characters and delivers a picture of both intimacy and tragedy. A neglected masterpiece of American independent film-making. Regrettably the director/star produced nothing else before her untimely death from cancer.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Wanda</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Barbara Loden and Foundation for filmmakers</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1970</p>", "description": "<p>A remarkable one-off from Elia Kazan&#8217;s wife.

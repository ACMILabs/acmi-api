Dr Lawther&#8217;s push for change extended to a more corporate and professional concept of fund-raising than had been practised in the past and also a rethinking on staff performance and salaries. The documentary features interviews with Dr Lawther, his staff and the Management Committee as well as an inside observation of clients and their pets and the hospital generally.

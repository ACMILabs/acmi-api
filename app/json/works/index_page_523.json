When the play is cast, William falls in love with the Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) who&#8217;s pretending to be a boy so she can be in the play. This love affair re-ignites Shakespeare&#8217;s passion to write and as the play unfolds during rehearsals it becomes &#8220;Romeo and Juliet&#8221; and Shakespeare emerges as the great playwright that we now take for granted. &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; is a joyous comedy romance which celebrates the passion of words. It&#8217;s great fun for Shakespeare enthusiasts to catch references to Shakespeare&#8217;s plays and allusions to Elizabethan drama. A great cast obviously has fun, with Judi Dench powerfully regal as Elizabeth I, Rubert Everett as Shakespeare&#8217;s great rival Kit Marlowe and Ben Affleck as the egotistical but talented Elizabethan actor Ned Alleyn. (Awards: Winner of 7 Academy Awards including 1998 Academy Award for Best Picture) This video includes a 24 minute documentary &#8220;Shakespeare in love and on film&#8221; with interviews with John Madden, Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616 - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ English drama - Early modern and Elizabethan, 1500-1600", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ English dramatists", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2296812, "name": "John Madden", "creator_id": 61978, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51516", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2296811, "name": "Harvey Weinstein", "creator_id": 4883, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q531599", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2296809, "name": "Donna Gigliotti", "creator_id": 71287, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q439364", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2296808, "name": "David Parfitt", "creator_id": 54946, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2296805, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2296802, "name": "Maxwell's Video", "creator_id": 75186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45246", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [27812], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91140, "acmi_id": "314222", "title": "Shanghai triad", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shanghai-triad", "creator_credit": "Zhang Yimou, Jean-Louis Piel, Wu Yigong and Shanghai Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Set in the 1930s, this film centres on the coming of age of Shuisheng, a country boy brought to Shanghai by his uncle to work for the powerful gang ruled by Tang.

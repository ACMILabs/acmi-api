This realist Australian film, the debut feature by Melbourne musician Giarrusso (who is a member of the Underground Lovers), is influenced by both Italian neo-realism and the socialist humanism of English filmmakers such as Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. Kane McNay won a special youth award at the 2001 AFI Awards. The sound design is by Philip Brophy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Prisoners' families", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social work with youth", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 816799, "name": "Twenty Twenty", "creator_id": 35646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816800, "name": "Australian Film Commission", "creator_id": 66813, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816801, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816802, "name": "Showtime", "creator_id": 35387, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816803, "name": "Fiona Eagger", "creator_id": 26936, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 816804, "name": "Vincent Giarrusso", "creator_id": 80454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51422", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33236], "external_references": []}, {"id": 108891, "acmi_id": "B1005348", "title": "Mallacoota fishing trip", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mallacoota-fishing-trip", "creator_credit": "Athol Adams", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1958", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Collection iPads", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Mallacoota - There is boatloads of nostalgic charm in this short black and white 1950s film of men taking a fishing trip at Mallacoota.

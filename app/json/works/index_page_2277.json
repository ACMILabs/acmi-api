As the executioner prepares to nail the spike-lined metal mask of the Devil over her face, she places a curse upon the Vaida family, swearing that she will return in the future to destroy her descendants and eliminate the family line forever. To prevent this from happening, Asa&#8217;s body is entombed in the crypt of her ancestor&#8217;s in a coffin with a glass window through which a cross is visible. Two hundred years later, Professor Kruveian (Andrea Checchi) and his protege, Dr. Andre Gorobec (John Richardson) are taking a short cut through a forest on their way to Moscow when their carriage throws a wheel. While waiting for the necessary repairs to be made, the pair explore a ruined crypt nearby and come across the tomb of the famous &#8220;witch&#8221;. Dr. Kruveian starts examining his amazing find when a giant bat attacks him. Slashing at it with his cane, he accidentally smashes the cross positioned above the glass window on the coffin. Ghoulishly fascinated, he opened the coffin and removes a painted icon and the metal mask from the corpse, so engrossed that he barely notices that blood from a cut on his hand dripping into the coffin.

What do boys want? This movie is a snap-shot of relationships between young people in the France of the mid-1960s, and though rooted firmly in time and place, it also resonates with the perpetual struggle between the sexes to come to an understanding of each other. Jean-Pierre Leaud is Paul, a young man who in between being a poet revolutionary is trying to work out which woman he really loves. This is the skeletal plot of &#8220;Masculin Feminin&#8221;, loosely based on the Guy de Maupassant short story, &#8220;La Femme de Paul and Le Signe&#8221;. However, the film Godard finished can lay claim to being one of the most influential works of cinema, a dazzling combination of verite reportage, Brechtian drama, and audacious editing and assemblage. Still exciting, still riveting, still poignant and satiric in its commentary on sex and love, this film still justifies critic Richard Roud&#8217;s claim that with &#8220;Masculin Feminin&#8221; Godard &#8220;succeeded in creating a new kind of cinema.&#8221; This bittersweet celebration of youth still feels fresh, it still excites.

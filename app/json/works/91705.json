John&#8217;s investigation into regaining his memory is set against a bleak film noir inspired background where the sun never rises, as well as a murder investigation into a series of deaths involving prostitutes (of which Murdoch is a suspect) and a former policeman (Colin Friels) who seems to have gone mad investigating the case.

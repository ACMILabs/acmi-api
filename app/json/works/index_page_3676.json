Full of the expected smart one-liners and folkloric reinvention, the episode serves to reveal the running thread through this season - what is the full extent and meaning of Buffy&#8217;s slayer power? Without a doubt season five is the darkest of the lot but also sees creator Joss Whedon&#8217;s writing team at their most ingenious. A case in point, this is the season that Buffy&#8217;s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) is revealed (Eps. 79 Buffy Vs. Dracula and Eps. 80 Real me). What role this new addition to the Buffy universe has becomes one of the more inspired inventions that the writers have dreamed up. Also set up in season five is Spike&#8217;s unsettling growing attraction to his object of hate, Buffy. (Eps. 82 Out of my mind). This plot strand is a perfect example how ideas are initially set up by Whedon and crew to have long term ramifications for the season and in this case for the entire series. This season&#8217;s villain turns out to be the high priestess of insanity, Glory played with exuberant glee by Clare Kramer( Eps. 83 No place like home). What Glory actually is simply goes down as one of the most breathtaking revelations in the series (Eps. 90 Checkpoint). Glory also proves to be quite literally an indestructible foe, lending the season a prevailing sense of fatalism that is ultimately realised in one unforgettable episode, The Body (Eps. 94 The Body).

Naturally with this new environment the dynamics change. No longer is Buffy the master of her own destiny as she discovers in the opening episode (ep. 45 The Freshman). In fact, university life proves to be a difficult adjustment for the slayer as band of campus vampires target the fragile Buffy and she misjudges the intentions of the campus lothario. Meanwhile, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) has come into her own, University proves to be an exciting challenge for the trainee wicca and the beginning of a new relationship with fellow campus witch, Tara (Amber Benson).

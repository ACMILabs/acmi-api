They discover Flannagan is using the phone at a Food Plus store to discuss his criminal activities and they are going to have to tap the phone to try and find out about a huge drug importation coming in, luckily Peter has an informant at the wharf to help them with their investigation.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Weapons", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Conduct of court proceedings", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal justice, Administration of", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal procedure", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Forensic science", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police corruption", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials in motion pictures", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Violent crimes", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2205348, "name": "Michael Carson", "creator_id": 21714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2205347, "name": "Mark Callan", "creator_id": 76564, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2205345, "name": "Bill Hughes", "creator_id": 22134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2205344, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2205343, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115586, "acmi_id": "S01425", "title": "Phoenix", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "phoenix", "creator_credit": "Bill Hughes and Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 91581, "acmi_id": "314723", "title": "Phoenix.

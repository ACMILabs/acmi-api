Set amid the milieu of an affluent middle class California high school, the protagonists are a predictable blend of bitchy girls who, immersed in their white-bread bubble world of lean torsos and good-hair days, are hyped on competitive spirits and a morally corrupted urge to win. One however learns the values of friendship and loyalty via the &#8216;outsiders&#8217; who invade her naive world and expand her limited experience, providing her with some essential pre-College life lessons. Lead actress Kirsten Dunst emits trademark goofy, sexy charisma in the role of head cheerleader Torrance - a potentially odious character who, in the hands of Dunst, becomes actually likeable. At Rancho Carne High, Torrence&#8217;s squad defend their National Cheerleading Champion status from a rival all-black troop - the sassy routines of which the RCH crew have been pilfering for years. Further to an archetypal romance for Torrance (with &#8216;rebel&#8217; dark-haired new boy), the script ponders notions of homophobia among teens - although, by supporting gay stereotypes, at times seems to endorse the ideas it (mildly) seeks to critique.

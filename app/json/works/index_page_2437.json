Gregoire is unschooled in the practice of coiffing, face powder, false modesty and acerbic remarks, however he quickly wizens up to court protocol when he is befriended by the Marquis de Bellegarde (Jean Rochefort), an old doctor familiar in the ways of the court. The Marquis believes that Gregoire has the required amount of wit to infiltrate the royal court and make a successful appeal, now all Gregoire has to do is steer clear of humiliation and love as he prepares for an audience with the king.

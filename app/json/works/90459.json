Their peace is shattered however when two seemingly nice young men arrive at their door and begin a series of cruel and violent games which culminate in torture and murder. Austrian director Michael Haneke directed a trilogy of films in the 1990s, (&#8220;The Seventh Continent&#8221;, &#8220;71 Fragments for a Chronology of Chance&#8221; and &#8220;Benny&#8217;s Video&#8221;) which all examined the relationship between violence, crime, media and class. But &#8220;Funny Games&#8221; takes Haneke&#8217;s critical examination one step further by this time implicating &#8220;us&#8221; - the audience - in his condemnation of modern mass media. Harrowing, intensely disturbing and frightening, &#8220;Funny Games&#8221; exploits our voyeuristic thrill in watching mayhem and violence. By refusing to either conform to the established conventions of the horror/thriller genre or to the simplistic explanations and sociology of most realist art-house cinema, Haneke instead indicts the modern cinema audience for not only our acceptance of film violence but our own complicity in encouraging the escalation of a violent and alienated society. This is a film that will start arguments. Countering the dominance of post-modern theories which argue that contemporary cinema audiences are media-literate and ironically resistant to manipulation, Haneke instead responds with a film that reinstates the necessity of the ethical and committed intellectual. Whatever intellectual position one takes to this film - and make no mistake, Haneke demands intellectual engagement as a moral imperative - this is not a film that can be easily dismissed. A film for which the adjective &#8220;shocking&#8221; is not hyperbole. This film is truly frightening. Cast includes Susanne Lothar and Franc Geiring.

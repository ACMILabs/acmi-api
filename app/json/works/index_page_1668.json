The term &#8216;Poetic Realism&#8217; was originally applied to literature; in the cinema it was first used in relation to Pierre Chenal&#8217;s &#8216;La rue sans nom&#8217; (1933). It is a critical construction with blurred edges - terms such as &#8216;populist melodrama&#8217;, &#8216;the social fantastic&#8217;, &#8216;noir realism&#8217; and &#8216;magic realism&#8217; can also apply. However, &#8216;Poetic Realism&#8217; designates pessimistic urban dramas, usually set in Paris (though there were colonial examples) in working class settings, with doomed narrative often tinged with criminality. The supreme examples are the films of Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert - &#8216;Quai des Brumes&#8217;<em> (1938), &#8216;Le jour se leve&#8217;</em> (1939) - but the canon aso includes Jean Vigo&#8217;s &#8216;L&#8217;Atalante&#8217;<em> (1934), Jean Renoir&#8217;s &#8216;La bete humaine&#8217;</em> (1938), Jacques Feyder&#8217;s &#8216;Le grand jeu&#8217;<em> (1933), Julien Duvivier&#8217;s &#8216;La belle equipe&#8217;</em> (1936) and Jean Gremillon&#8217;s &#8216;Gueule d&#8217;amour&#8217;<em> (1937); to which could be added Marie Epstein&#8217;s &#8216;La maternelle&#8217; (1933).

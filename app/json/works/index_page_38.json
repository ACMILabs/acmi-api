Based on the novel by Isabel Colegate.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;â†’ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;â†’ Social conflict", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;â†’ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;â†’ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1762958, "name": "Alan Bridges", "creator_id": 23299, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q920584", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1762957, "name": "Geoffrey Reeve", "creator_id": 23943, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q15437107", "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1762956, "name": "Geoff Reeve Films & Television Ltd.", "creator_id": 86362, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1762955, "name": "Edenflow", "creator_id": 23941, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37553", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [21168], "external_references": [{"id": 1048, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3211385"}, {"id": 6246, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "57300"}]}, {"id": 98461, "acmi_id": "508173", "title": "Aussie assault", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "aussie-assault", "creator_credit": "Sportmaster Programs, Garry Holt, Bill Scholer and Harvey Spencer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A behind-the-scenes look at the work and preparation that went into Australia II winning entry in the America&#8217;s Cup.

In the opening sequence Kales Leadingham has escaped from a lunatic asylum. Arriving at a bus stop be relays his travails (in flashback) to a woman seated there. One day at Bondi Beach, Sydney, a woman &#8216;Dingo Girl&#8217; arrives in search of answers to her past (cue unremitting shots of Dingo Girl&#8217;s large breasts, a la Russ Meyer). Shortly after Dingo Girl and Kale enter a warehouse where a bizarre array of subversive types reside. Inhabitants engage in ritualistic Neo-Nazi ceremonies that result in sado-masochistic sex.

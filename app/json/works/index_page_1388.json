The hand crank enabled the operator to view the film at any speed with the ability to go forwards or backwards at will.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["160 x 190 x 70mm"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 1439318, "name": "Mettoy", "creator_id": 82096, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "", "role_id": 604, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "180746", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1960", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1960"}], "labels": [39628], "external_references": []}, {"id": 100052, "acmi_id": "E000078", "title": "Very early lamp houses", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "very-early-lamp-houses", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>Matching very early lamp house x 2</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Very early lamp houses</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "<p>Matching very early lamp house x 2</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Matching very early lamp house x 2</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Measurements", "display_values": [" 850 x 350 x 700mm"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "13284", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [39548], "external_references": []}]}

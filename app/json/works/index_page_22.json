Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film has two sequences. Firstly, a debutante ball circa 1960s, where we see the very nervous young couples as they descend a staircase to be introduced to the committee of older people overseeing the proceedings. Jack captures the rigorous nature of a debutante presentation with its strict dress code and rules, and somewhat stultifying atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Secondly, Jack captures entertainment at an ice rink that includes several different acts.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected hightlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 title cards, &#8216;Vegas News 70&#8217; and &#8216;Delighted Debutants&#8217; (sic)<br />\n00:00:18:00 the debutantes line up for a formal photograph with their flower posies in the shape of the Freemasons &#8216;square and compass&#8217; symbol<br />\n00:00:39:00 organisers inspecting the debutantes where we see 1960s style hair styles held in place by hair spray<br />\n00:00:60:00 dignitories enter the ball in a parade and the women are presented with flower posies as they line up on the stage ready for the debutantes presentation<br />\n00:01:32:00 two children appear as mascots, slightly confused<br />\n00:01:53:00 the first of the young women debutantes, in their white formal ball dresses, appear on the stage with their partners, young men in formal evening suits<br />\n00:02:43:00 negotiating the stairs, no hands on the rails<br />\n00:02:58:00 the curtsy and the bow to the dignitories<br />\n00:03:54:00 the musicians<br />\n00:04:28:00 the Freemasons society symbol above the dancers<br />\n00:05:03:00 members of the band playing their instruments<br />\n00:05:35:00 stepping through a particularly painstaking dance<br />\n00:06:25:00 the formalities over, debutantes and their partners relax at the tables in the ballroom<br />\n00:07:00:00 the brass section of the band<br />\n00:07:07:00 dancing what appears to be the &#8216;Pride of Erin&#8217; waltz<br />\n00:07:46:00 various skaters performing on ice<br />\n00:09:37:00 two ice skaters dressed in a cow costume<br />\n00:12:18:00 an ice skater leaping through a ring of fire</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:33:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Victoria - Social life and customs", "History&nbsp;→ Clothing and dress - History", "History&nbsp;→ Victoria - History", "History&nbsp;→ Women's clothing - History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ballroom dancing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ice skaters", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Recreation areas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballroom dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Costume", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theatrical costume", "Places&nbsp;→ Ballarat (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1220520, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B2003842_mi01_JAndersonReel17.tif.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

Juanita’s body has never been found and her murderers have never been charged.</p>\n<p><i>The Beehive</i> consists of scripted fictions, documentary interviews and choreographed scenes with multiple actors playing the role of Juanita. The film is ever-changing, as a different combination of footage is randomly selected for each screening with 1,344 possible variations. <i>The Beehive</i> therefore continually morphs and evolves to reveal different interpretations of this violent historical act and its social context.  Operating like a forensic investigation, the film presents a variety of puzzle pieces, asking new questions and potentially pointing to an answer.</p>\n<p>The title is a reference to Juanita Nielsen’s famous hairdo but is also a metaphor for human cities. In classical times the beehive was seen as a hierarchical and densely industrious hub; in pre-Christian symbolism the beehive was a dark cooperative womb guided by a powerful queen.

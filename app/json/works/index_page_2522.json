Starring Australia&#8217;s first film star, Lottie Lyell, the film was a critical and commercial success and offered audiences more than just a melodrama. It questioned the social mores of the day and the double standards of morality in regard to the men as the seducers. Musical accompaniment is by members of the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, conducted by composer Donald Hollier.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:17:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Rural families", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Betrayal - Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Seduction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Silent films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2043596, "name": "Raymond Longford", "creator_id": 17044, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3421009", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043595, "name": "National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "creator_id": 10175, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121314986", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2043598, "name": "Lottie Lyell", "creator_id": 76046, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6685026", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043597, "name": "Arthur Higgins", "creator_id": 78289, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4799064", "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043594, "name": "ScreenSound Australia", "creator_id": 16130, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2565882", "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42745", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1918", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1918"}], "labels": [26008]}, {"id": 86510, "acmi_id": "308195", "title": "Uncivilised", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "uncivilised-a", "creator_credit": "Charles Chauvel and Expeditionary Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1936", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1936-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 24308, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7882671"}], "brief_description": "<p>This is the story of Beatrice Lynn, a high society author, who heads into the wilds of northern Australia in search of an Aboriginal tribe ruled by a white king, Mara.

It concerns Tono Brtko (Jozef Kroner), a carpenter who is appointed &#8220;Aryan controller&#8221; of a button shop by his facist brother-in-law. The shop is owned by the Jewish Frau Lautmann (Ida Kaminska, doyenne of the Yiddish Theatre in Poland), who is not only elderly but deaf and short-sighted, and thinks that Tono is her new assistant. Through a mixture of weakness, vacillation and decency he fails to disabuse her, and a mutually beneficial relationship develops. Meanwhile, the fascist authorities have other plans for the town&#8217;s Jews. This is an extraordinarily effective picture of &#8216;everyday fascism&#8217; in a small community, and although it revolves around a grim and tragic theme, it is played largely as a gentle comedy.

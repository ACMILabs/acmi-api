In the rehearsal space Rivette cuts frequently between the 35- and 16-millimeter footage, juxtaposing two kinds of documentary reality; in the couple&#8217;s apartment, filmed only in 35, the oscillation between love and madness, passion and mistrust, builds to several terrifying and awesome climaxes in which the distinctions between life and theater, reality and fiction, become virtually irrelevant. In many ways this is Ogier&#8217;s richest, finest performance, and Kalfon keeps pace with her every step of the way. This film captures the dreams and desperation of the 60s like few others, and you emerge from it changed; it&#8217;s a life experience as much as a film experience.

This episode profiles the &#8216;Golden age of silent film&#8217; and the incursion of Avant-Garde and Art Deco aesthetics in feature films. During WWI, European cinema (and particularly the houses of Gaumont, Pathe and L&#8217;Eclair) endures a reversal of fortune under both the economic and stylistic pressure of the USA. Melies has sold his studio, star Max Linder is seeking fortune in the USA. French cinema is stagnant and unable to extract itself from the theatrical stylistics of the &#8216;film d&#8217;art&#8217; (literary adaptations), while the U.S. are holding audiences captive with weekly deliveries of adventure and comic serials. During the Roaring Twenties, French cinema renews itself entirely through its first avant-garde movement (expressionism) and second avant-garde (surrealism). Influenced by D.W. Griffiths&#8217; &#8216;Broken Blossoms&#8217;(1919), Delluc sought in his own films to convey, through editing, the motions of human psychology, and to this end developed the flashback technique in &#8216;La femme de nulle part&#8217; (1922). The innovations in film technique which resulted from impressionists&#8217; desire to evoke human subjectivity included close-ups, camera movements, rapid editing, flashbacks and subjective point-of-view shots. Marcel L&#8217;Herbier &#8216;El Dorado&#8217; (1921) features &#8216;semi-subjective&#8217; sequences to express a character&#8217;s psychological state.

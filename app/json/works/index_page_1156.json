Phil Moskowitz, a loveable rogue is on a deadly mission to prevent a winning recipe for egg-salad from falling into the wrong hands. With the help of some beautiful aides, Moskowitz must foil the plans of the evil Shepherd Wong. The film features a bevy of Japanese beauties and falls into predictable notions of gender and genre. Allen followed up this film with other slapstick comedies such as &#8220;Bananas&#8221; and &#8220;Take the money and run&#8221; at the start of a prolific and successful career as a writer/director/actor.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962832, "name": "American International Pictures (AIP)", "creator_id": 1987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962833, "name": "Castle Hill", "creator_id": 25674, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962834, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962831, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51309", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1966", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1966"}], "labels": [33164]}, {"id": 93323, "acmi_id": "316740", "title": "What's up Doc?", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "whats-up-doc", "creator_credit": "Saticoy Productions, Warner Bros Pictures and Peter Bogdanovich", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Taking its cues from the classic 1930s screwball comedies of Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges, &#8220;What&#8217;s up Doc&#8221; is most reminiscent (more or less a remake) of &#8220;Bringing up Baby&#8221; (Hawks, 1938).

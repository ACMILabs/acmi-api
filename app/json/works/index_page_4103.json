The result is a film of astonishing direct frankness, which reveals a woman on a quest for love, sex and freedom but determined to tell all to us as an audience. She is prepared to reveal her humiliations as well as her highs. She drinks. She dances. She goes through intense periods of promiscuity and self-examination, telling us every detail of her triumphs and disappointments with the men (and boys) of the bars, beaches and backstreets of Mexico. Cast includes Jackie Burroughs, Erando Gonzalez and Anita Olanick.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mexico", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Docudrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Racism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Feminist motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Holder, Maryse", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Literature&nbsp;→ Holder, Maryse", "People&nbsp;→ Holder, Maryse", "Places&nbsp;→ Mexico"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 948379, "name": "Canada Council", "creator_id": 22118, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948382, "name": "Ontario Arts Council", "creator_id": 22119, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948383, "name": "Ontario Film Development Corporation", "creator_id": 63093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948384, "name": "Telefilm Canada", "creator_id": 22121, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948385, "name": "Louise Clark", "creator_id": 22122, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948386, "name": "Jackie Burroughs", "creator_id": 76512, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q137634", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948387, "name": "John Walker", "creator_id": 74135, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 948388, "name": "John Frizzell", "creator_id": 76513, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16243972", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 948378, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35489", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [19161], "external_references": [{"id": 3035, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q12133944"}, {"id": 3376, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "131336"}]}, {"id": 77226, "acmi_id": "015447", "title": "A Window to trade", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-window-to-trade", "creator_credit": "Film Australia, Elisabeth Knight and Susan Cornwell", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1982", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Shows the role of the International Trade Development Centres in advising and guiding business about the marketing of overseas products to Australia.

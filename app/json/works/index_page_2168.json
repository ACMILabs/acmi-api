this is the story of Longfellow Deeds (Gary Cooper), an unassuming, tuba-playing young country hick who inherits his uncle&#8217;s $20 million estate. He is catapulted from small-town peace to New York turmoil. Discovering he&#8217;s been duped by crooked big city associates and the beautiful girl reporter (Jean Arthur) whom he loves, Deeds decides to give away his fortune to the needy. His lawyer interprets this as a sign of insanity and a bitter courtroom battle ensues with Deeds refusing to testify. Only love can save the day.

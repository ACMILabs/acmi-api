The press retaliates so violently that massive cuts are ordered to appease the anger of the opinion makers. This is the time Ruan&#8217;s ex-husband re-appears and threatens to expose her as an adulteress. Ruan&#8217;s star starts to spiral down. The film blends fact and fiction, documentary and narrative. Rare footage of the real Ruan&#8217;s performances are mixed with Cheung&#8217;s re-creations of Ruan&#8217;s lost films. In a clever twist of casting, the role of Ruan, originally intended for Anita Mui (Kwan&#8217;s star in &#8216;Rouge&#8217;), went to Maggie Cheung. Cheung was the same age as Ruan at the time of her suicide and had had many run-ins with the Hong Kong press. Kwan blends his narrative with documentary style footage of Cheung explaining how she researched the part and interviews with Chinese cinema veterans. The result is an interrogation on cinema itself. The film won several awards, including the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 1992 Berlin Film Festival. Also stars Carina Lau, Waise Lee, Cecilia Yip. In Cantonese with English subtitles. The film is also known as &#8216;The Actress&#8217;, &#8216;The New China Woman&#8217; in various English releases or &#8216;Ruan Ling-yu&#8217; in Mandarin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Chinese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Germany - Berlin - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media and the arts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Women in the motion picture industry", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Mass media and the arts", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hong Kong", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2134164, "name": "Stanley Kwan", "creator_id": 29477, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q705995", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134160, "name": "Chui Siu Ming", "creator_id": 79332, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036473", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134162, "name": "Willie Chan Chi Keung", "creator_id": 79333, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036835", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134159, "name": "Paragon Films", "creator_id": 32132, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035692", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2134155, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47646", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 28, "name": "Hong Kong", "slug": "hong-kong"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [29899]}, {"id": 65908, "acmi_id": "001845", "title": "Centre court champions", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "centre-court-champions", "creator_credit": "Howard Rubie, British Petroleum and Cinesound", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1966", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1966-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Demonstrations of good play in tennis on a grass court and a hard court with comments by Harry Hopman.

This work traces his life story from Kansas City to the New York jazz scene of the 1950s, tracing the short, somewhat tragic journey of a lauded and revered, if commercially ignored, musician. As well as providing key performances of signature tunes - Ballade, Yardbird Suite, Just friends, Koko, Confirmation, Au Privave and Kim Bloomdido - this work also comprises his only surviving TV performance, and interviews with Bird&#8217;s contemporaries. Contains wonderful vintage footage of Bird performing, plus tunes performed by Thelonious Monk, Louis Armstrong and Count Basie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Race discrimination", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Improvisation (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2134085, "name": "Multiprises", "creator_id": 23416, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223480", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134090, "name": "Pioneer Artists", "creator_id": 37287, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144091", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134087, "name": "Sony Video Software Company", "creator_id": 37286, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298901", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134082, "name": "Toby Byron", "creator_id": 23415, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034900", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2134079, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53174", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [34618]}]}

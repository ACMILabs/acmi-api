Set amid the milieu of an affluent middle class California high school, the protagonists are a predictable blend of bitchy girls who, immersed in their white-bread bubble world of lean torsos and good-hair days, are hyped on competitive spirits and a morally corrupted urge to win. One however learns the values of friendship and loyalty via the &#8216;outsiders&#8217; who invade her naive world and expand her limited experience, providing her with some essential pre-College life lessons. Lead actress Kirsten Dunst emits trademark goofy, sexy charisma in the role of head cheerleader Torrance - a potentially odious character who, in the hands of Dunst, becomes actually likeable.

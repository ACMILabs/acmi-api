In this deceptively banal location a science experiment is being conducted on errant students, each of whom are hand selected then essentially lobotomised, after which they start to behave like &#8216;perfect&#8217; students. After a family tragedy, the Clark family move from Chicago to Cradle Bay, and Steve, (a teenager struggling with a past tragedy), tries to comes to terms with the odd behaviours that he sees around him. Gavin and UV (two arch outsiders) implore Steve that danger abounds behind the seemingly A-grade students, the Blue Ribbons, whose violent outbursts belie their otherwise purist nature. Katie Holms plays Rachel, a rebel bad-girl who teams up with Steve to try to uncover the mystery and save future students from a sinister fate. David Nutter&#8217;s feature debut pays due attention to the tropes of the genre, providing requisite thrills and tensions, beatings and romantic interludes, all to a soft-core punk-rock soundtrack. Cast includes James Marsden, Nick Stahl, Steve Railsback, Bruce Greenwood, Bill Sadler and Chad E. Donella.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "French", "French", "Greek", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Horror", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963481, "name": "David Nutter", "creator_id": 80649, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963480, "name": "Jonathan Shestack", "creator_id": 32988, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963479, "name": "Armyan Bernstein", "creator_id": 80154, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963478, "name": "Village Roadshow Pictures", "creator_id": 838, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963477, "name": "Hoyts Film Partnership", "creator_id": 36017, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963476, "name": "Beacon Pictures", "creator_id": 34039, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963475, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20182, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/g4otnfWwvLnNSOriSAdOUmGXX8L.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Disturbing behavior = Disturbing behaviour (David Nutter) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

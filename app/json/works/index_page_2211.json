Through a philanthropic enterprise he continued to fund development projects for the Nepalese people - projects that the people themselves requested. His legacy will live on through the children of Nepal attending one of the some 30 schools that his &#8220;Himalayan Trust&#8221; built since 1961 - in many cases by his own hands. This DVD contains two documentaries - one made in 1980 is about Sir Edmund at sixty years of age and the other made in 2000 continues the subject matter of his philanthropic work - the DVD release commemorates the 50th Anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary&#8217;s ascent of Mount Everest.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Nepal - Social life and customs", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mountains", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Charities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community and school", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School buildings", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Mountaineering", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Bridges", "People&nbsp;→ Hillary, Edmund, Sir, 1919-", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Places&nbsp;→ Everest, Mount (China and Nepal)", "Places&nbsp;→ Himalaya Mountains", "Places&nbsp;→ Nepal"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2114264, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298847", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114260, "name": "Michael Dillon", "creator_id": 22827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298847", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114257, "name": "Dick Smith Adventure", "creator_id": 20436, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315126", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2114255, "name": "Michael Dillon Film Enterprises", "creator_id": 20465, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357797", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2114254, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52935", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34390]}, {"id": 89669, "acmi_id": "312498", "title": "Between two wars: sunshine and eclipse (1927-1934)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "between-two-wars-sunshine-and-eclipse-1927-1934", "creator_credit": "William Weintraub, Nicholas Balla and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1960", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Confident, prosperous Canada, expanding in all directions; then the stock market crash of 1929, its sequel the Great Depression, and a nation staggering with poverty and unemployment.

This program focuses on Ireland and some of the Irish playwrights who gave birth to a new kind of theatre, one that had more substance than the 19th century Victorian melodrama and moralising society plays which were being performed in Britain, most significantly, at a time when Ireland was fighting for independence from British empirical connections. Richard Eyre discusses in great detail the influences and historical background of several Irish playwrights including William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Sean O&#8217;Casey, and J.M. Synge and the part these individuals played in the establishment of a national theatre and a national identity for Ireland. Yeats, Shaw and Wilde were all born in Dublin around the same time, but Shaw and Wilde very early on exiled themselves to England to make their fame and fortune through satirising the English high society. In contrast, against a background of political turmoil and tension, Yeats, in collaboration with Lady Augusta Gregory, conceived The Abbey Theatre which was to become Ireland&#8217;s national theatre and a stage for the works of Sean O&#8217;Casey and J.M.

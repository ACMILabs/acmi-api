This compassionate portrait is quite riveting and fairly down-beat but is also an inspiring chronicle of the human spirit. Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen flesh out the context of Benjamin&#8217;s upbringing by examining the social strata of Cabbagetown, an under-ground haven and seedy white-trash neighbourhood before being yuppified in the 1990s. Features a guest appearance by Patti Smith, an artist who inspired Benjamin, and in the bonus footage, a live performance from Chan Marshall, aka Cat Power.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Interviews", "Biographical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Arts", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ HIV (Viruses)", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Grunge music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Singers - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Interviews", "People&nbsp;→ Singers - Biography", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2111667, "name": "Jem Cohen", "creator_id": 89, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6177037", "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111668, "name": "Peter Sillen", "creator_id": 80763, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111660, "name": "C-Hundred Film Corporation", "creator_id": 36305, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036043", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111663, "name": "Cowboy Booking International", "creator_id": 36306, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143584", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111665, "name": "Gravity Hill Films", "creator_id": 36307, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222536", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111666, "name": "Pumpernickel", "creator_id": 36308, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091406", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2111657, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52255", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33862]}]}

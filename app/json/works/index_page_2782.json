With a supporting cast that is less disposable than the teenager characters of slasher films of the past, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; is more suspenseful and more frightening, and a horror film that can stand on its own merit.

The nightmares of the meat-hook-wielding fisherman are preventing Julie from putting the brutal murder of her best friend, Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), behind her.

Its success was mainly due to its high profile guests and variety of entertainment offered to its viewers along with the revolving core group of hosts including Sammy Davis Jr, Jimmy Durante, Don Adams, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland and the ever popular Bing Crosby. This video is a special edition of the final show hosted by Crosby which takes a look back at some of the most memorable moments with performances by Nat King Cole (&#8220;Unforgettable&#8221;), Fred Astaire and Ethel Merman (&#8220;Anything goes&#8221;), Judy Garland (&#8220;Be a clown&#8221;), Dean Martin (&#8220;Volare&#8221;), and many more. It also includes some great comedy sketches by such comedians as Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx, Don Knots, Jack Benny, Debbie Reynolds, Phyllis Diller and Burns and Allen with some &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; footage of rehearsals and bloopers by the stars. This is a travel down memory lane. An interesting footnote: the Rolling Stones made their first US TV appearance on the show in 1964.

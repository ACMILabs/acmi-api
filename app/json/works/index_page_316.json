This film concerns the emotional upheaval experienced by three friends who attempt to solve the problem by intellect. Psychiatrist Dr Christian Faber (Noel Coward) and his wife, Barbara (Celia Johnson) have begun to take each other for granted in their marriage. Christian begins an affair with Barbara&#8217;s best friend Leonora (Margaret Leighton). The affair is discovered by Barbara and the three avoid hurting one another over the issue. Christian is affected more deeply however, viewing his actions as a failure to meet his own moral and professional standards.

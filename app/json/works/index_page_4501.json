It’s the art behind the animation and required studying physics and anatomy to create realistic, though fantastical, characters.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Disney Studio Artist</p>\n<p>Clean-up model sheet</p>\n<p>Photostat on paper</p>", "details": [{"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Photostat on paper"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 43838}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1035090, "name": "Disney Studio Artist", "creator_id": 85044, "role": "visual artist", "role_id": 493, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": null, "source_identifier": null, "production_places": [{"id": 29, "name": "USA", "slug": "usa"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [58610]}, {"id": 118323, "acmi_id": "xos-118323", "title": "Collective", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "collective", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Collective</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "<p>In Collective, documentarian Alexander Nanau follows a team of journalists who uncover a far-reaching government conspiracy following a deadly nightclub fire in Romania which kills dozens.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>In Collective, documentarian Alexander Nanau follows a team of journalists who uncover a far-reaching government conspiracy following a deadly nightclub fire in Romania which kills dozens.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": null, "source_identifier": null, "production_places": [], "production_dates": [], "labels": [57826]}, {"id": 118087, "acmi_id": "xos-118087", "title": "Gurrutu’mi Mala (My Connections)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gurrutumi-mala-my-connections", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2019-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [{"id": 278, "name": "Connecting through film", "description": "Film acts like a time capsule to our collective past.

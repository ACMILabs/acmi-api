This version is presented in its entirety and has compelling performances by the supporting cast of John Hurt, Jeff Bridges and Sam Waterston and locational shoots of breathtaking beauty.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952670, "name": "Michael Cimino", "creator_id": 77662, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952669, "name": "Joan Carell", "creator_id": 26516, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952668, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952667, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 17935, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/kW4Vk31nhtKPKGuYMaVATq3wcHC.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Heaven's gate (Michael Cimino) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40536", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [24071]}, {"id": 93418, "acmi_id": "50977", "title": "Heaven's burning", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "heavens-burning-dvd", "creator_credit": "Craig Lahiff, Al Clark, Helen Leake and Dup Art", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1997", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/j7l2BgeJCNhiFwRrK5p5FhjliG5.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Midori (Yuki Kudoh) is a young Japanese bride, who, despising her new husband, decides to flee him on their wedding night.

During a ball given by Charles, Lord Chateauneuf, a member of Louis XI&#8217;s party, tries to rape Jeanne. This causes a rupture between the King and the Duke and a war between France and Burgundy. Robert and Jeanne are separated. When Jeanne, carrying a secret letter from the King to Burgundy, is pursued by Chateauneuf, she benefits from the protection of a pack of wolves. This story was originally filmed by Raymond Bernard in 1924.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Paul Cadeac, Rene Bezard ; director, Andre Hunebelle ; writers, Jean Halain, Pierre Foucaud, Andre Hunebelle ; photography, Marcel Grignon ; music, Jean Marion.<br />\nCast: Jean Marais, Rossana Schiaffino, Roger Hanin, Jean-Louis Barrault, Louis Arbessier.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1806510, "name": "Paul Cadeac", "creator_id": 83001, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 891063, "name": "Andre Hunebelle", "creator_id": 83002, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q518179", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146999", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [55761]}, {"id": 116265, "acmi_id": "X000469", "title": "La Bible = the Bible", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "la-bible-the-bible", "creator_credit": "Andre Tranche and Marcel Carne", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1977", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This version of the Bible is illustrated by the mosaics of Monreale, near Palermo (Sicily).</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Andre Tranche ; director, Marcel Carne ; writers, Marcel Carne, Didier Decoin ; photography, Jean Collomb ; music, Jean-Pierre Benjamin.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>La Bible = the Bible</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Andre Tranche and Marcel Carne</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>France, 1977</p>", "description": "<p>This version of the Bible is illustrated by the mosaics of Monreale, near Palermo (Sicily).</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Andre Tranche ; director, Marcel Carne ; writers, Marcel Carne, Didier Decoin ; photography, Jean Collomb ; music, Jean-Pierre Benjamin.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>This version of the Bible is illustrated by the mosaics of Monreale, near Palermo (Sicily).</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Andre Tranche ; director, Marcel Carne ; writers, Marcel Carne, Didier Decoin ; photography, Jean Collomb ; music, Jean-Pierre Benjamin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1806506, "name": "Andre Tranche", "creator_id": 83261, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 891058, "name": "Marcel Carne", "creator_id": 32058, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q52409", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146997", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1977", "notes": "", "to_year": "1977"}], "labels": [55759]}]}

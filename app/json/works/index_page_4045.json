Italy, in the town of Aquileia, during the barbaric age of Huns and Ostrogoths, this opera tells the tale of invasion and victory, love and betrayal, patriotism and vengeance and the eventual fall of the great babarian, Attila the Hun (Evgeny Nesterenko) at the hands of Ezio (Silvano Carroli), Foresto (Veriano Luchetti) and the love who betrayed him, Odabella (Maria Chiara). Featuring the Orchestra and Chorus of the Arena di Verona conducted by Nello Santi, this is a grand-scale production complimented by an impressive stage setting and design, and a very strong cast of lead singers. Sung in Italian with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884128, "name": "Brian Large", "creator_id": 15897, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884127, "name": "Giuliano Montaldo", "creator_id": 36468, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884126, "name": "Radiotelevisione Italiana", "creator_id": 15142, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884125, "name": "National Video Corporation", "creator_id": 23494, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 884124, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52396", "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [33972]}, {"id": 75774, "acmi_id": "013372", "title": "Attic of the wind (K)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "attic-of-the-wind-k", "creator_credit": "Morton Schindel and Weston Woods Studios", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1974", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>What happens to the things that blow away?

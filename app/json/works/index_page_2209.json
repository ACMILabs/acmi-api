Their world is thrown into disarray when Armand&#8217;s son announces he is engaged to a conservative Senator&#8217;s daughter who is eager to meet their future son in laws parents. It will take all of Albert&#8217;s stage experience to convince the future in laws they are a &#8216;normal&#8217; family. This reworking of the classic French farce &#8216;La Cage aux Folles&#8217; will delight viewers with it sparkling humour and great performances by Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Hank Azaria, Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest, Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:54:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture remakes", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Farce", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Motion picture remakes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 955419, "name": "Mike Nichols", "creator_id": 71366, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 955418, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 955417, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18490, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/bEyK1K1EgWapeKgkcOLC1ejl9nj.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The Birdcage (Mike Nichols) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42904", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [26164]}]}

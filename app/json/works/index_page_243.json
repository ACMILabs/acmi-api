Many Hollywood stars play themselves or versions of themselves, including a hilarious cameo by Leonardo Di Caprio as a self-obsessed drug addled superstar. Judy Davis plays Lee&#8217;s long suffering wife, who can&#8217;t compete with the famous starlets who come Lee&#8217;s way, and Branagh himself is excellent in a role which sees him spookily take on Woody Allen&#8217;s persona and quirks.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Celebrities in mass media", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cocaine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "People&nbsp;→ Celebrities - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995456, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q25089", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995455, "name": "Jean Doumanian", "creator_id": 29398, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6170556", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995454, "name": "Magnolia Productions", "creator_id": 27594, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995453, "name": "Sweetland Films BV", "creator_id": 27595, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1995452, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49031", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [31139], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91647, "acmi_id": "314794", "title": "Fame", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fame", "creator_credit": "Allan Parker, Alan Marshall, David De Silva and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An energetic musical drama tracing the lives of eight talented teenagers who join Manhattan&#8217;s High School for the Performing Arts to train for show business careers.

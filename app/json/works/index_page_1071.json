Based on the Cornell Woolrich novel &#8220;Black Alibi&#8221;, &#8216;The Leopard man&#8217; utilizes to great effect, a subtle, moody soundtrack and expressionistic lighting to suggest rather than show, proving that the imagination can sometimes be more terrifying. Like their previous collaboration&#8217;s &#8216;Cat People&#8217; (1942) and &#8216;I Walked with a Zombie&#8217; (1943), the film is made up of a series of chilling set pieces that unnerve and linger rather than shock in their disquieting tone and atmosphere. Cast includes Margo, Dennis O&#8217;Keefe, Jean Brooks, Isabel Jewell and James Bell.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Circus animals", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Leopards", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Horror", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Circus animals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961006, "name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "creator_id": 71465, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961007, "name": "Val Lewton", "creator_id": 77040, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961008, "name": "Jacques Tourneur", "creator_id": 77041, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961005, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50178", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1943", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1943"}], "labels": [32174]}, {"id": 93462, "acmi_id": "316904", "title": "The Leopard = Il Gattopardo", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-leopard-il-gattopardo-dvd", "creator_credit": "SGC, Societe Nouvelle, Pathe Cinema, Titanus Productions, Goffredo Lombardo and Luchino Visconti", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1963", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Based on the novel by Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa, Visconti&#8217;s &#8220;The Leopard&#8221; is one of cinema&#8217;s key works about aristocratic history.

But with the growing force of the new bourgeois class and with Garibaldi&#8217;s move to unify the whole of the Italian people into one country, the age of royalty and aristocracy is coming to an end. The Prince knows too well that he is unable to resist the force of history: all he can do is ensure that he secures the best possible future for his family, including his opportunistic nephew, Tancredi (Alain Delon). Visconti, the Marxist Count, faithfully evokes Di Lampedusa&#8217;s lament for the dying, decadent class. But Visconti was also able to create a richly sumptuous work that conveys the architecture, morality, mores and manners of a past world. Rotunno&#8217;s justly acclaimed cinematography assist him in creating a series of lavish sequences set both in the rugged Sicilian countryside and inside the decaying mansions and palazzos belonging to the Prince. The film culminates at a ball in which Tancredi and his fiance (Claudia Cardinale) are to be introduced to the new Sicilian bourgeoisie (who have already turned against their liberator, Garibaldi, and are hoping to take on for themselves the privileges and lifestyle of the aristocrats). The Prince surveys this new world and is aware of his own approaching death, and through this awareness, the death of a culture, a class and a world. The ball is a beautifully choreographed ballet in which we see displays of dazzling wealth; it is also a cruel recognition of the ruthlessness of power.

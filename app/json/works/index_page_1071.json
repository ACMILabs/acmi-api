Nafas flies to the Afghani-Iran border and then begins a difficult and dangerous journey across the war-ravaged country to the city of Kandahar. On arriving at the border she has to put on the burkha, which symbolises the oppression of women she has sought to escape but which also allows her to disappear and to evade the gaze of the Taliban as she undertakes her search. Makhmalbaf&#8217;s film, made before the terrorist bombing on the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001, is a deeply moving indictment of war. He achieves this by creating distinct poetic episodes around the central story: a young boy whose family and village has been destroyed in the war tries to combat his illiteracy and stay on at the Qu&#8217;ranic school which is his only hope of survival; refugee workers on the Afghani-Iran border attempt to teach children how to avoid land mines; an African-American exile wanted for terrorism in the USA attempts to be a doctor to a devastated village; and Red Crescent workers in the inhospitable centre of Afghanistan attempt to make surreal decisions on which lives are worth saving.

As we see what seems to be an army of land mine victims rush, crawl and hop across the desert to grab at prosthetic limbs that UN helicopters drop from the skies, we are aware that we are witnessing horrors and savagery that remain, in words, indescribable. Often &#8220;Kandahar&#8221; shows the limitations of being filmed in hazardous, difficult circumstances: the acting is not always consistent, some scenes are truncated and ragged.

Music by George Fenton.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>My Name is Joe is a powerful and moving film from well-known, politically fierce director, Ken Loach. Set in the slums of Glasgow, it focuses on Joe (played superbly by Peter Mullan), a reformed alcoholic who makes a living out of odd jobs and derives much enjoyment from coaching the local soccer team. He gets a new lease on life, however, when he meets and falls in love with Sarah (Louise Goodall), a healthcare worker. Things begin to fall apart when Joe is pulled back into the world of drugs and crime in order to save his friend, Liam (David McKay), whose life is at stake when he can&#8217;t pay back the local drug lords for his partner&#8217;s heroin addiction. Sarah&#8217;s disapproval of the underworld and Joe&#8217;s connections to it pushes their relationship to breaking point and Joe to the very edge. Loach&#8217;s film combines a razor-sharp portrayal of unemployed and working-class life in Glasgow with strong doses of melodrama. Clearly &#8216;leftist&#8217; in his concerns, Loach reveals the limited options available to those living in a world dominated by a closed circuit of unemployment, substance abuse and crime. The possibility of breaking free of this circuit lies in the character, Joe, whose redemption however comes at a high price. In a manner reminiscent of Nicholas Ray, Loach dramatises the intense rhapsody and sheer desperation of gaining and losing a sense of humanity. &#8220;My Name is Joe&#8221; is both poignant melodrama and stirring political realism.

It focuses on a number of individuals who have envisaged new and more sustainable ways of inter-relating with the land they live and work on. They all emphasise that breaking the cycle of stress on the land requires radical shifts in the way we think. Max Lindiger promotes the creation of small self-sustaining communities, rather than ever-expanding urban sprawl as a way of reducing suburban isolation and costly food transportation. Margaret Skelton and her husband have turned to permaculture as a way of efficiently using their small block of land. Permaculture is an intensive, organic agricultural system which conserves natural resources and produces a surplus of food. Sugar has been a staple crop of the Nambour region for many years. However the heavy use of chemicals have depleted the land which, since the decline of the sugar industry, is being sold off for real estate.

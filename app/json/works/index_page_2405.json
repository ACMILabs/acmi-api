It contains a series of interviews, interspersed with newsreel footage, placing the American feminist movement in a historical perspective. Six of the women who gave impetus to the movement, Betty Friedan (author), Kate Millett (author and sculptor), Rita Mae Brown (author and poet), Lila Karp (writer and professor of women&#8217;s studies), Ti-Grace Atkinson (feminist theorist and activist) and Margo Jefferson (writer and critic), discuss those issues that most concern them, and which are still being debated.

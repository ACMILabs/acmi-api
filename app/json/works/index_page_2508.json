Starling&#8217;s job is to tap Lector&#8217;s mind in order to find the serial killer known as &#8220;Buffalo Bill&#8221;, a killer who skins his victims. Lector uses his macabre knowledge to entice Clarice into intricate but chilling mindgames. The film&#8217;s focal point is not so much the catching of the killer, but the relationship between Starling and Lector. The audience is manipulated so that Lecter is simultaneously repellent and charismatic, thus contributing to the tension and unease of the film.

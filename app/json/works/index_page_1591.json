Topan, a photographer, visits his childhood friends who have married each other. The three of them end up travelling to Lombok together, which proves to be not such a good idea. The husband is revealed to be sexually incompetent and he ends up having an affair with Topan&#8217;s photographic model (although to what extent remains unclear as the film was censored by the Indonesian Censorship Board). Meanwhile, Mayang finds out that she has more in common with Topan than her husband. This is arguably Nugroho&#8217;s most mainstream effort. Later on, he went on to develop his hallmark strengths - intricate cultural nuances, sparse dialogue and a sense of hightened realism. This film won Best Film at the Indonesian Film Festival in 1991 and Best young Director at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival in South Korea in the same year.

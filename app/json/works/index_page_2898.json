Based on Alex Haley&#8217;s &#8220;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&#8221;. It is a landmark film in that it has an African-American as the hero of a Hollywood epic. Malcolm X was initially a small-time crim who converted to Islam and became a central figure in the the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. A passionate and dynamic speaker, his vehement condemnation of race relations fightened and incensed many white Americans. The film faithfully follows Malcolm X&#8217;s life: his poor childhood and violent early adulthood, his prison years, his involvement in the Nation of Islam and the Civil Rights Movement, and the lead-up to his assassination. Though a long film of the epic genre, Spike Lee&#8217;s direction is colourful and well-paced, and some of the sequences are dazzling, including the pilgrimmage to Mecca. Spike Lee was the first Western filmmaker allowed to film in the Holy City. &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221; reclaims, with passion and dignity, the life of a controversial but inspiring man. Denzel Washington plays Malcolm X and Angela Bassett plays his wife.

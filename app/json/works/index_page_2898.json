Sarah Jane finds herself one of the frozen chosen when she lies on a tranquilliser couch/short-range matter transmitter. When two of the Ark&#8217;s inhabitants are re-animated, med-tech Vira (Wendy Williams) and leader Noah (Kenton Moore) - they reveal that civilisation underwent mass cryogenic processing to avoid their imminent destruction by solar flares; the only problem being that their best laid plans for a programmed re-animation didn&#8217;t work due to their equipment being damaged by an unknown being. The unknown beings turn out to be The Wirrn, an insect race who have found a valuable food source on the Ark and laid it&#8217;s eggs on the solar stacks. It&#8217;s up to the Doctor to save the day. This was the second episode in which the fourth Doctor (Tom Baker 1974-1980) appeared. Originally broadcast in the UK on BBC1 between January 25 and April 15, 1975.

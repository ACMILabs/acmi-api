Schepisi creates a perfectly realistic evocation of both old age and the passionate desires and dreamings of youth. &#8220;Last Orders&#8221; is in fact a peculiar kind of road movie in which the most important part of the journey is across time, and one in which the characters and personalities of the travellers are much more important than the dour suburbia through which they travel. At the heart of the film is Michael Caine&#8217;s Oscar nominated performance as Jack Dodd but he is ably supported by a superlative cast of British character actors. By placing actors such as Caine, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings in a film about aging, death and grief, Schepisi also creates a loving memorial to the golden age of British cinema - the tough working class films of the early sixties which smashed the genteel pretensions of an earlier British cinema (though gentility was to arise again in the period dramas which now form the backbone of British television). &#8220;Last Orders&#8221; is based on the award winning novel by Graham Swift.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Finnish", "German", "German", "Norwegian", "Swedish", "Turkish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Funeral rites and ceremonies", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ London (England) - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Aging", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Old age", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Aging", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Funeral rites and ceremonies", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Old age", "History&nbsp;→ Funeral rites and ceremonies", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963777, "name": "MPB", "creator_id": 36222, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963778, "name": "Scala Productions", "creator_id": 35620, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963779, "name": "Winchester Films", "creator_id": 34492, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963780, "name": "Fred Schepisi", "creator_id": 72597, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963781, "name": "Elizabeth Robinson", "creator_id": 80728, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963782, "name": "Fred Schepisi", "creator_id": 72597, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 963776, "name": "Columbia", "creator_id": 22037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52192", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33807]}, {"id": 69513, "acmi_id": "321926", "title": "Last of the windjammers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "last-of-the-windjammers", "creator_credit": "New England Film Productions and Athol Emerton", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1940", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1940-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A record of the departure from Newcastle of the barque Lawhill, one of the last of the square riggers to visit Australia.

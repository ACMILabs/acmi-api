School students will use the Internet for assignments, downloading images and text, presenting sophisticated graphics in class. In the medical arena, ambulance workers will scan injuries, ascertaining advice from doctors and nurses who download patient&#8217;s medical history and personal details. Gates forecasts that even the most minor business will have a website, and that at home entertainment will be re-shaped by interactive television and on-line activities such as gambling. He also envisages problematic issues such as privacy, copywriting information and images on the net, and concerns surrounding the sharing of information.

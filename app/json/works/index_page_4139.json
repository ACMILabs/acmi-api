It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes of Billy’s travels on the steamship Southern Cross, in 1960 which travelled between Australia and Europe. It is a little difficult to locate exactly where Billy visits but we can definitely see scenes of England, the Netherlands and Greece. The SS Southern Cross was a modern passenger ship built in 1955 to an innovative design which catered specifically for the tourist trade, starting a trend of ‘aft-engined’ ships, leaving more space for passengers and their needs. The Southern Cross was also the first major liner to have no cargo space, other than for ship&#8217;s stores and passenger luggage.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 views of a

It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America.

The Track screen references Grace Cossington-Smith’s painting <i>The Bridge in Curve</i> (1926), the Sydney Harbour Bridge near completion. Cossington-Smith celebrates not only the construction of the bridge as a triumph of engineering but also Australian modernism. Gladwell replicates Cossington-Smith’s perspective while celebrating the ways in which the riders have reclaimed the space underneath the bridge as a space for creativity, beyond the intended functionality of the space.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Trials screen references Caspar David Friedrich’s romantic painting <i>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog</i> (1818), in which a man standing on a rocky outcrop looks out onto a stormy ocean. Like Friedrich’s subject, the trials rider is ‘wedged between two time signatures – the slow geological signature of the rocks and the furious swell of the ocean’, as Gladwell describes it. As the rider reaches the top of the rocks he rests, putting his feet to the ground, and takes in the view of the ocean from a vantage point he has worked hard to achieve. Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Gladwell’s rider is insignificant within a landscape while striving for mastery over it.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Shaun Gladwell<br />\nDual-channel video

Zhongliang (Leslie Cheung), an orphan boy, is introduced into the Pang family by his sister who is married to the heir of the family.

When news reaches Beijing that the Pang family has passed on the reigns of the estate to a a woman, Ruyi (Gong Li), and a cousin, Duanwu (Kevin Lin), Biggie sends Zhongliang back to Shanghai to seduce Ruyi and take over the estate. As Zhongliang infiltrates his way back into the Pang family, his childhood passion for Ruyi is revived and he finds it near impossible to carry out his mission. According to Chen Kaige, &#8216;Temptress moon&#8217; can be seen as pure psychological drama, a film on male domination and hierarchy in China at that time, or as the story of a girl becoming a woman. But what mattered to the director was to produce a film on contemporary China, in spite of the historical setting. The film encountered many obstructions from the Chinese authorities due to its matter-of-fact depiction of sex and drug use and its barely masked reference to current political issues.

The abandoned carnival which fills Mary with guilt and fear represents her deserted dead girlfriends - the cinematography which conjures up Hitchcock&#8217;s use of shots featuring the individual enclosed within their environment to create a sense of loneliness, as in Vertigo and Frenzy. Hilligoss&#8217; (Mary Henry) amateur performance sees her immaculately make the transformation from a confused yet strong willed character to a maniacal woman who can&#8217;t escape her demons while sparing watchers too many dramatic exaggerated facial close-ups. Harvey&#8217;s story of a woman&#8217;s psychological existence between the two worlds of life and death suggests influences for Lynch, &#8216;Night of the living dead&#8217; and &#8216;The Sixth sense&#8217;. Cast includes: Candace Hilligoss, Frances Feist, Sidney Berger, Art Ellison.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Religion", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Traffic accidents", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religion", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Amusement parks", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Zombie drama", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Organ music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964063, "name": "Harcourt Productions", "creator_id": 36430, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964064, "name": "Herk Harvey", "creator_id": 21453, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964062, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52354", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1962", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1962"}], "labels": [33939]}, {"id": 65831, "acmi_id": "001751", "title": "Carnival in Quebec", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "carnival-in-quebec", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Roger Blais and Jean Palardy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A colorful record of Quebec City&#8217;s winter carnival - with all the fun and frolic of a southern Mardi Gras but in gleaming winter setting.

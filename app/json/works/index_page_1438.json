We see traffic lights, pedestrians, cars, trams, double-decker buses, city buildings and shop fronts. We see the reputable clothing and apparel store, Mohan’s, on Hankow Road, a Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation building and signage. There are scenes along the harbour and a trip on a funicular tram to the city heights. This could possibly be the Peak Tram which takes tourists and residents to the upper levels of Hong Kong. We see views of the harbour and skyscrapers, and a number 72 bus to Aberdeen.</p>\n<p>Originally shot on Super 8mm film</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 Double-decker buses,

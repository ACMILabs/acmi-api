Wong Fei Hung, played by Chan, is a 19th Century folk hero in Chinese culture and cinema, a master of kung fu who fights the injustice of British colonialism (this character would later be portrayed by Jet Li in &#8216;Once upon a time in China&#8217;). <i>Drunken Master </i> finds Wong in his early years as a troublesome fighter who is sent to his uncle, the hard-drinking title character, for instruction in discipline and martial arts. After enduring torturous training, Wong runs away only to encounter some local villains. Being badly beaten, he returns to his uncle who finally trains him in &#8220;drunken style&#8221; kung fu. Cast includes: Jackie Chan, Simon Yuen and Lam Yin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hong Kong", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 2}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 811584, "name": "Seasonal Film Corporation", "creator_id": 32412, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811585, "name": "Zhang Quan", "creator_id": 34108, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811586, "name": "Yuen Woo-Ping", "creator_id": 32508, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49958", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 28, "name": "Hong Kong", "slug": "hong-kong"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [31974], "external_references": [{"id": 1891, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q838514"}]}, {"id": 119319, "acmi_id": "186842", "title": "Ariarne Titmus’ coach Dean Boxall on her winning gold", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "ariarne-titmus-coach-dean-boxall-on-her-winning-gold", "creator_credit": "Tyson Whelan", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 26 JUL 2021", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2021-11-12", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Digital screen recording from @TysonWhelan’s Twitter", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>Australians were in a frenzy of excitement when Ariarne Titmus won gold in the women’s 400m freestyle in her Olympic debut in Tokyo.

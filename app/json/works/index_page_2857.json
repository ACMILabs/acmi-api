Unfortunately, all the GI offers Hedwig back in the USA is life in a trailer park. Hedwig uses his ample imagination to write songs but credit for them is taken by his nemesis (and one true love), Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt II). While Hedwig is forced to tour second-rate restaurants and night clubs, Tommy Gnosis has become a huge star. Hedwig won&#8217;t rest till Tommy acknowledges both his love and his debt.

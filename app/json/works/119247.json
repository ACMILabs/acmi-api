And we could rise up with&#8212; we took raffles and dinner dances and things like that. And then in the &#8216;90s when we were just struggling, we realized we had no money.

We can&#8217;t send players on trips and things like that. We cannot afford to pay our player&#8217;s memberships. We have to ask them to pay, that sort of thing.

We have the contract to empty them the [INAUDIBLE] Bunkers. And when we get enough trucks, we can make a lot of money. And that&#8217;s how we source the money to run the club.

Or we might well lose it.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>MAN: Everyone on our committee are very successful businessmen in the town in their own right. And they all got kids playing.

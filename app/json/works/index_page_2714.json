This tribute to his life and work will make people remember his life and work and to think about the poem that meant so much to the people who fought and died in that awful war.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Flanders", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Canada", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poetry", "Literature&nbsp;→ Poets", "People&nbsp;→ McCrae, John 1872-1918", "Places&nbsp;→ Flanders"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 906700, "name": "Robert Duncan", "creator_id": 76023, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906699, "name": "Barbara Shearer", "creator_id": 78498, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906698, "name": "Jonathon Desbarats", "creator_id": 78497, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906697, "name": "International Documentary Television Corporation", "creator_id": 78496, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 906696, "name": "ONF | NFB", "creator_id": 66965, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 906695, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43792", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [26848]}, {"id": 75591, "acmi_id": "323310", "title": "John Lethbridge", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-lethbridge", "creator_credit": "Robert Lindsay, Judi Stack, Bob Weis, National Gallery of Victoria and Open Channel Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 4 of Series &#8220;Survey (National Gallery of Victoria)&#8221;.<br />\nJohn Lethbridge&#8217;s works, his paintings, drawings and sculptural installations develop out of a personal necessity to try to give an order to the rituals and repeating experiences of life that recur in an apparently unordered and random world.

Relating the tragedies in his personal life to his development as a poet, the film portrays Keat&#8217;s reactions to deaths in his family, financial worries, brutal criticism to his poetry, a troubled love affair, and the failing health that Keats endured, and rose above in his exceeding devotion to his art. Excerpts from his letters and poetry reveal the integrity of the man and the genius of the poet.

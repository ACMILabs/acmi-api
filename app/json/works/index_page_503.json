This film was beset with difficulties from the start. After years of attempting to obtain sufficient finance to film Kipling&#8217;s original story, Flaherty found support from Alexander Korda in 1935 and the Flahertys journeyed to India to adopt (from them) a new method of film making - the original practice adopted by Flaherty of &#8220;letting the story flow&#8221; and absorbing the way of life of native people and their surroundings was not entirely carried out in the case of &#8220;Elephant boy&#8221;. Whilst much of the film was shot in studios in England, the film is distinguished by beautiful photography and many fine sequences breathing the very atmosphere of India, captured by Flaherty on location</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Social life and customs", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/elephant-boy", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1983756, "name": "Zoltan Korda", "creator_id": 14656, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q218845", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1983755, "name": "Robert Joseph Flaherty", "creator_id": 14655, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1983754, "name": "Alexander Korda", "creator_id": 14654, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55221", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1983753, "name": "London Film Productions", "creator_id": 14653, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22727", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1936", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1936"}], "labels": [6600], "external_references": []}, {"id": 66464, "acmi_id": "002482", "title": "Covered Wagon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "covered-wagon", "creator_credit": "James Cruze and Famous Players-Lasky Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1923", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1923-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Recounts the journey by the men and women who left the Mississippi and Ohio valleys in 1848 to migrate to Oregon.

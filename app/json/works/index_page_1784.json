In its emotional purity, in its alternate tender and harsh remembrance of mid-century Australia, and in its poetically simple but devastating depiction of both tragedy and freedom, &#8220;The Year my voice broke&#8221; is internationally acknowledged as one of the finest film works to have emerged from this country.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Australia - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Bullying - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ New South Wales - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Youth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Bullying - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Childhood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Youth", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnant schoolgirls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Youth", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 960276, "name": "Avenue Pictures", "creator_id": 25275, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960277, "name": "Kennedy Miller Productions", "creator_id": 66822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960278, "name": "Terry Hayes", "creator_id": 66843, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960279, "name": "Doug Mitchell", "creator_id": 68353, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960280, "name": "George Miller", "creator_id": 66844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 960281, "name": "John Duigan", "creator_id": 20892, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

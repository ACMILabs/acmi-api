Five teenagers travelling through Texas (two of them brother and sister investigating the mysterious desecration of their grandfather&#8217;s grave), pick up a creepy hitchhiker and find themselves embroiled in a macabre and nightmarish reverse of southern hospitality. From its eerie opening images to its shocking finale, &#8220;The Texas chain saw massacre&#8217; was initially considered a cheap drive-in exploitation film but, through strong critical appraisal, went on to be screened as part of the director&#8217;s fortnight at Cannes and the American Museum of Modern Art now has a print of it in its permanent collection. Cast includes Marilyn Burns, Allen Danziger and Gunnar Hansen as Leatherface.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Slaughtering and slaughter-houses", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murderers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Horror"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-1974", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956018, "name": "Vortex", "creator_id": 29319, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956019, "name": "Tobe Hooper", "creator_id": 60219, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 956017, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43771", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1974", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1974"}], "labels": [26828], "external_references": [{"id": 6304, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "30497"}]}, {"id": 88225, "acmi_id": "310777", "title": "The Terror of Tiny Town", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-terror-of-tiny-town", "creator_credit": "Columbia Pictures Corporation, Principal Productions, Abe Meyer, Bert Sternbach, Jed Buell and Sam Newfield", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1938", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1938-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This movie has all the classic elements usually found in westerns of the 1930&#8217;s - 1950&#8217;s.

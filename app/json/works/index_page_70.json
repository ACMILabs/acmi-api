By turns sad and exhilarating, the shimmering blue of the screen becomes a canvas across which the audience interacts with the essayist filmmaker. Jarman was one of the English-language world&#8217;s most daring, transgressive and experimental film artists and it is fitting that his last film continues his maverick&#8217;s love for exploration and the avant-garde.

Thematically, &#8220;Amores perros&#8221; explores the idea of life as an endless struggle where humans are like &#8216;animals&#8217; in their sheer attempt to survive. In fact, both &#8216;dog&#8217; and &#8216;human&#8217; undergo mutilation and abandonment throughout the film and are pushed to the extreme in their ability to endure a world of hard-knocks. Mexican cinema and television has a long history of melodrama and &#8216;Amores perros&#8217; clearly emerges from this tradition, infusing strong doses of story melodrama with modern storytelling and edgy stylistics. If its &#8216;life lessons&#8217; are at times cliched and heavy-handed, the film is still an engaging, commanding experience. In Spanish with English subtitles. Note: Contains violence against animals and human mutilation and carnage.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Spanish", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Aggressive behavior in animals", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dogs", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Dogs in motion pictures", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Traffic accidents", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homelessness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Mexico", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/loves-a-bitch", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996355, "name": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu", "creator_id": 34305, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996354, "name": "Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu", "creator_id": 34305, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996353, "name": "Zeta Film (Mexico)", "creator_id": 34304, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996352, "name": "Altavista Films", "creator_id": 34303, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996351, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50146", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 185, "name": "Mexico", "slug": "mexico"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [32146], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92655, "acmi_id": "315963", "title": "The Fifth element [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-fifth-element-dvd", "creator_credit": "Luc Besson, Patrick Ledoux, Columbia and Gaumont-British Instructional", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The Fifth Element takes an amazing glimpse into the future, with wonderful visual effects from the people who gave us &#8220;Titanic&#8221;, &#8220;Nikita&#8221; and &#8220;The Professional&#8221;, and unique costumes by visionary designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier.

He rationalises that this will allow him to channel his energy into his career and hobbies, which in turn will help him to forget about sex. However, his resolve is soon put to the test when he meets the gorgeous body-builder Steve (Michael T. Weiss) while working out at the gym. Torn between wanting to ravish Steve and wanting to maintain his celibacy, Jeffrey turns to his best friend Sterling (Patrick Stewart) for advice.

Seeking the advice of Sterling and his partner Darius, a post-modern evangelist, a self-help group, his liberal parents, and a randy Catholic priest, Jeffrey struggles to come to terms with the concept that a life lived in fear is no life at all.

Instead, it operates more or less like a real-world camera, with each photo taken from the character’s perspective.<br />\nIan MacLarty described lining up the perfect shot as ‘like a game in itself’, requiring a lifelike combination of precision and luck to capture the perfect angle and quality of light.<br />\nThese photos, so lovingly framed and shot, have a radical undertone. Their explorations could be considered a kind of psychogeography – an artistic practice that involved exploring urban environments to emphasise personal responses to place, rather than focusing on productivity or purpose.<br />\nSimilarly, the images captured here showcase The Grannies’ emotional, playful relationship with digital space that contradicts the intended design of the game.<br />\nSince they were taken, Red Dead Redemption 2 has been updated to stop players from travelling outside the map.

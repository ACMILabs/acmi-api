Cast includes Joe Dallesandro (Andy Warhol&#8217;s factory star), Udo Kier, Monique Van Mooren, and Arno Juerging.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Insanity", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1809459, "name": "Andrew Braunsberg", "creator_id": 23968, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964982, "name": "Compagnia Cinematografica Champion", "creator_id": 30851, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964984, "name": "Paul Morrissey", "creator_id": 63906, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q383764", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964981, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53087", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [34532], "external_references": [{"id": 4172, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "3043"}]}, {"id": 95025, "acmi_id": "319064", "title": "Flesh = Andy Warhol presents Flesh", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "flesh-andy-warhol-presents-flesh-dvd", "creator_credit": "Andy Warhol, Factory Films and Paul Morrissey", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Flesh, the first collaboration between Paul Morrissey, Joe Dallesandro and Andy Warhol, charts a day in the life of Joe (Dallesandro), a street hustler and married man who needs to raise $200 to pay for his wife&#8217;s lover&#8217;s abortion.

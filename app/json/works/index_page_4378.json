Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows a group of holiday makers camping on Phillip Island in Victoria. Wallace shows several good close-ups of the koalas that are a feature of the island and one of the old kilns of the chicory industry of the past that are dotted over the landscape. There are also views of the bridge that was built in 1969 between San Remo on the mainland and Newhaven to replace the old wooden one, and many views of rolling, crashing waves on rocky coastline.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film, there is a gap of several seconds a few minutes in, beginning at 00:02:42:00 and ending at 00:02:58:00.</p>\n<p>00:00:02:00 views of the sea from

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.</p>\n<p>The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film contains footage of activities at various spots around the Wilson&#8217;s Promontory National Park in Victoria, including Sealer&#8217;s Cove, Streaky Beach and Pillar Point. The filmmaker shows dramatic views of the sea and rocky cliffs around the Promontory, shots of Tidal River, groups of hikers and hiking trails, people relaxing on the beaches and the lush vegetation of the area.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:04:00 Rosella parrots perched on hats of visitors.<br />\n00:01:58:00 views over the sea from the

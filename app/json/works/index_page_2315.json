At the time of their meeting, the young Ana&#8217;s father dies and Ana believes that she is able to communicate with her dead father if she stays close to Otto. When Otto&#8217;s parent&#8217;s separate, Ana&#8217;s mother and Otto&#8217;s father become lovers. Time passes and as Otto and Ana reach adolescence, Otto comes to live with Ana and their mother and father. Although they are considered siblings, the two teenagers become lovers and so begins a sad and complex love story with an ambiguous end. Transience, circularity and self reflexivity are themes within the narrative which are achieved through rigorous editing; the careful juxtaposition of particular motifs which are contained with a variety of coincidences and recurring images.

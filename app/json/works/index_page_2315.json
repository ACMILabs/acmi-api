Lee, high on his addiction to crack and being flush with money to support his habit, attempts to subvert the exchanges to his advantage and is liberal in sharing their secret with all and sundry - jeopardising his friendship and their discovery. Based on a true story and set against a backdrop of Nixon&#8217;s impeachment, the film has been read as a metaphor for the disillusion felt throughout America in the 1970s and the search for meaning in a time of Vietnam, the Cold War and political mistrust, balanced against advances in space exploration and artistic and sexual freedom. Cast also includes Pat Hingle, Joyce Van Patten and Lori Singer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:05:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Cold War", "Biographical", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Espionage", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Extortion", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Smuggling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-falcon-and-the-snowman", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2347571, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55303", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347569, "name": "Gabriel Katzka", "creator_id": 79066, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16012455", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347570, "name": "John Schlesinger", "creator_id": 13888, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55303", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2347567, "name": "Orion Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 9553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51431", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [33244]}, {"id": 93737, "acmi_id": "317321", "title": "Diana and me", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "diana-and-me", "creator_credit": "David Parker, Matt Carroll, Pratt Film Productions and Village Roadshow Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45262, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q5271064"}], "brief_description": "<p>In this fish-out-of-water comedy Toni Collette plays Diana Spencer, a down-to-earth rural girl who shares a birthday with her namesake, Princess Diana.

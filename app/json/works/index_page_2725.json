Apathetic student Shirotsugu Lhadatt winds up in the Royal Space Force after bad grades destroy his dreams of entering the local airforce. Unfortunately, the Royal Space Force is little more than a motley group of young cadets and ageing scientists struggling to send man into space while suffering public ridicule, government wrangling, and a lack of resources. However, after Shiro crosses paths with devout missionary, Riquinni, he becomes determined to be the first man in space. Spurred on by his unrequited love for her, Shiro braves assassins, funding crises and the threat of war to make his dream of travelling to the stars a reality. A stunningly animated feature film.

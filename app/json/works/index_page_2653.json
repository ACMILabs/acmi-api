Made during the last days of the Occupation, the film combines the superficial glamour of the Parisian high society with the seething passions and jealousies that cause a spurned femme fatale, Helene, to seek her ex-lover&#8217;s humiliation. Through the climactic revelation of Helene&#8217;s deception, Bresson stages the deeper realisation of love&#8217;s redemptive power in an ending of truly magical transcendence. A landmark in cinema history&#8230; . Its influence on subsequent French cinema is far from exhausted&#8221; (David Thomson). The importance of &#8216;Les dames du Bois de Boulogne&#8217; cannot be understated. Richard Roud, citing its formative influence on Antonioni, Demy, and Straub, among others, calls it &#8216;a universally seminal film.&#8217; (In a recent interview, Godard provocatively called &#8216;Les dames du Bois de Boulogne&#8217; the &#8216;only&#8217; film of the French Resistance&#8217;, and Antonioni recently singled it out as a great influence on his own work.) Cocteau wrote the dialogue for this glistening melodrama of revenge, and though Bresson&#8217;s emerging style and his characteristic emphasis on entrapment, sacrifice, suffering and redemption are unmistakable, the world of &#8216;Les dames du Bois de Boulogne&#8217; is also Cocteau&#8217;s, with its elegantly acid language, luxe setting, and Maria Casares&#8217; piercing performance as a woman who arranges a bad marriage for the man who spurned her.

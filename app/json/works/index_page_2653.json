The exhibition surveys forty years of Richter&#8217;s work using examples that identify &#8216;touchstones&#8217; for the artist as selected by Richter himself. The works explore the fluid line between the abstract and figurative and use process both as a means and an end. The exhibition at Westspace Gating&#8221; is a group show exploring sound technologies. Featured are the works by Michael Graeve, Simon Kilvert (Decent Column), Rhino Lintz and Mark [Marco] Fusinato (2&#8217; 30&#8221;). Screen Talk this week features Leslie Eastman whose work is concerned with exploring themes such as; language and time, the objectivity of language and its phenomenon versus conditional experience.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Themes, motives", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art appreciation", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art criticism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art galleries", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 21st century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists and community", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Conceptual art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Installations (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Minimal art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Painting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Public art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233766, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233769, "name": "Lena Corner", "creator_id": 80529, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121336963", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2233763, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233761, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115599, "acmi_id": "S01440", "title": "Public hangings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "public-hangings", "creator_credit": "Andrew MacKenzie", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": []}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 93887, "acmi_id": "317641", "title": "Public hangings.

Pauly (Paul Fenech) is a pizza delivery boy who works for the explosively bad-tempered Bobo (Johnny Boxer); Pauly&#8217;s other main occupation is to drive about in his souped-up car, with its blaring sub-woofer stereo; meanwhile his friends Sleek (Paul Nakad), and Davo (Jabba) similarly cruise around in their own customised vehicle, encountering violent cops and sexually eager women. Fans of the series will recognise the vigour with which writer Fenech attacks sacred cows of Australian culture - principally, but not exclusively, the young male Lebanese/Australian racial stereotype - whilst applying a thick layer of infantile machismo and t&amp;a humour. Certainly not to the taste of all, but quite original and daring in both concept and execution. Cast also incudes Annalise Braakensiek with cameos by Merv Hughes, Tim Ferguson, Jeff Fenech, Shane Porteous, Red Symons, Bernard King and Kamahl.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Stereotype (Psychology) in mass media", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Lebanese - Australia", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Lebanese - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fat-pizza", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2228407, "name": "Paul Fenech", "creator_id": 7173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228405, "name": "Tanith Carroll", "creator_id": 80848, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228402, "name": "Paul Fenech", "creator_id": 7173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228401, "name": "Village Roadshow Pictures", "creator_id": 838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228400, "name": "Fat Pizza", "creator_id": 36553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2228399, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52488", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [34036], "external_references": []}, {"id": 82463, "acmi_id": "303615", "title": "Fat of the land", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fat-of-the-land", "creator_credit": "Baptist Pork Production in association with Civilian Tragedy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1986", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A compilation of short British &#8216;art-house&#8217; films 1984-1987 as follows: &#8220;Procar&#8221; (dirs.

We see pine trees, fence posts and wire as well as a small out-house type construction made of wood with a corrugated iron roof. It could be an outdoor toilet.</p>\n<p>There is footage of various varieties of tropical fish including butterfly fish, and varieties of coral including brain coral and large shells. These scenes appear to be shot through glass, so they could be at an Aquarium or on a glass-bottomed boat.</p>\n<p>We see scenes of a whale watching expedition, with the top of a whale just visible above the water.

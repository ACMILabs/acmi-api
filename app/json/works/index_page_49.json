This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film records some of the scenes and events during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and her consort to Victoria in 1954.</p>\n<p>Unusually for this Collection, this reel does not open with Kenneth Rankine’s signature title card (as seen in other reels) but instead uses an ‘iris in’ camera effect (where the image opens in a circle, surrounded by black, and then expands to fill the frame). The scene that then appears is of crowds lining streets as a motorcade drives past, followed by further footage of the crowds and mounted police in procession.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:</p>\n<p>00:00:37:00 a banner reading &#8216;Welcome to Moorabbin&#8217; can be seen, erected at the side of a park, with the flags of Australia and the United Kingdom (the ‘Union Jack’) displayed nearby, as the motorcade passes through the shot. 00:00:41:00 a green tram passes very close to the motorcade. 00:00:59:00 another clearly visible banner reads &#8216;Welcome to our Royal Visitors&#8217;.</p>\n<p>00:01:03:00 the scene switches abruptly to footage of an aeroplane in the sky. 00:01:14:00 the camera is back at street-level, as uniformed military personnel march down a tree-lined roadway. 1950s cars and clothing styles are on display in these shots.

The contest has been the initiative of the town&#8217;s corrupt mayor, Herod (Gene Hackman), and attracts gunslingers from around the county, all with mysterious pasts. Ellen is seeking revenge on Herod for past injustices, the smooth talker known as &#8216;The Kid&#8217; (Leonardo DiCaprio) may possibly be the mayor&#8217;s son, and the quiet Reverend Cort (Russell Crowe) refuses to participate despite being the fastest gun in town. As the contest continues all is revealed, leading to a final showdown between Ellen and Herod.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Arabic", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-quick-and-the-dead", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995330, "name": "Sam Raimi", "creator_id": 5352, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995329, "name": "Patrick Markey", "creator_id": 85924, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995328, "name": "Allen Shapiro", "creator_id": 78354, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995327, "name": "Joshua Donin", "creator_id": 79563, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6289764", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995326, "name": "Tri-Star Pictures", "creator_id": 22768, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1995325, "name": "Entertainment Distributors Company", "creator_id": 78212, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48807", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [30933], "external_references": []}, {"id": 91364, "acmi_id": "314473", "title": "The Sting [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-sting-dvd", "creator_credit": "George Roy Hill, Julia Phillips, Michael S Phillips, Tony Bill and Universal Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1973", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1973-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Johnny Hooker (Robert Redford) is a small time con-man working the backstreets of 1930s Chicago.

Particular attention is paid to the formation of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and the influence and legacy of its first Federal Commissioner- Anslinger. The program is divided into the war on drugs over the years, 1937-47, 1948-63, 1964-69, 1970-77, 1980-98 and defines the &#8220;official truth&#8221; about dope for the era (which covers a wide array of truths - linking it to degeneracy, heroin addiction, communism), and which strata of society was most associated with its usage at the time. What emerges is a political campaign that has increased from a $220 million dollar investment to a $214.7 billion one that continues on regardless.

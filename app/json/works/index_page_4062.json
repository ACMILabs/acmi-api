The second part of the film supplements the above material, showing biological relatives of these spiders, including the primitive sea scorpions, found only as fossils, the aquatic king crab, land crabs, carnivorous harvestmen, and the ararina, including the cheesemite, red spiders, sheep tick, and the so-called sea spiders.

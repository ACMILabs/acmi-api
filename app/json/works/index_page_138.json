General Yen, however, finds himself fascinated by Megan&#8217;s feisty nature, and finds excuses not to send her back to her fiancee. Any chance of a relationship developing between the two is irrevocably destroyed when Yen&#8217;s mistress Mah-li (Toshia Mora) betrays both him and Megan, initiating a sequence of events which result in the downfall of the mighty General. Originally Columbia Pictures assigned this film to silent film director Herbert Brenon, with Frank Capra lobbying for and eventually winning the project after Brenon left the studio due to creative and financial differences. Controversial due to its principle theme of interracial romance, this moody, sensual production deviated from Capra&#8217;s usual filmic concerns with its touching yet dramatic depiction of doomed love, a factor which Capra allegedly hoped would earn him an Academy Award. The characterisation of the Chinese in this film seems quite racist by today&#8217;s standards, especially the casting of Swedish silent film star Nils Asther, in the title role, plus a fantasy sequence where a demonic General Yen menaces Megan in her bedroom. The controversy surrounding the potential romance between a Chinese man and an American woman saw the film being banned in some areas. &#8220;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&#8221; was adapted from Grace Zaring Stone&#8217;s 1930 romantic novel of the same name.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Missionaries", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnic relations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Missionaries", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Exoticism in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Stereotype (Psychology)", "History&nbsp;→ Missionaries", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-bitter-tea-of-general-yen", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1972453, "name": "Frank Capra", "creator_id": 71814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51492", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972452, "name": "Walter Wanger", "creator_id": 20366, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1351511", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1972451, "name": "Columbia Pictures", "creator_id": 70107, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48018", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1932", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1932"}], "labels": [30236], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90711, "acmi_id": "313714", "title": "Quebec: duplessis et apres...", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "quebec-duplessis-et-apres", "creator_credit": "Paul Larose and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1972", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This film establishes a parallel between the 1970 electoral campaign in Quebec and the 1936 campaign dominated by Maurice Duplessis.

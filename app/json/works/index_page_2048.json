The interface consists of a head-mounted display and real-time motion tracking based on breath and balance. There are a dozen world-spaces in Osmose, most based on metaphorical aspects of nature. Immersants are able to journey anywhere within these worlds, as well as hover in the ambiguous transition areas.</p>\n<p>The first realm encountered is a three-dimensional Cartesian grid which functions as an orientation space. With the immersant&#8217;s first breaths, this grid gives way to a clearing, surrounded by forest. It is possible to enter the clearing&#8217;s single tree and the interior of its leaves, float through the never-ending forest, or descend into subterranean depths among translucent roots and rocks. One can also sink through the pond into an oceanic abyss, or rise above the clearing into cloud. Two additional realms function as conceptual parentheses around the work: the substratum Code located below the underearth, which contains much of the actual software used to create the work; and the superstratum Text, located above the cloud, consisting of excerpts of relevant texts on technology, the body and nature.</p>\n<p>The sounds in Osmose were sampled from a male and female voice uttering phonetics, then digitally processed and localized in three-dimensions. The sound is generated on the fly, in real time, responding like the visuals to changes in the immersant&#8217;s head and body position, direction and speed. After fifteen minutes of immersion, a symbolic life-world appears and then irretrievably recedes, bringing the session to an end.</p>\n<p>Osmose was so named for &#8220;osmosis&#8221; from &#8220;osmos&#8221; (Greek) &#8220;to push&#8221;; a biological process involving passage from one side of a semi-permeable cellular membrane to another. Osmose, as metaphor, is about longing: for transcendence of difference through mutual absorption; for dissolution of boundaries; for overcoming estrangement between self and other; for the soulful intermingling of self and world.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: This text is from an artist statement composed by Char Davies for the Transfigure exhibition)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Osmose</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Char Davies</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Canada, 26 OCT 2003-29 MAR 2004</p>", "description": "<p>Osmose (1995) is an immersive virtual environment with real-time display of 3D computer graphics and interactive 3D localized sound.

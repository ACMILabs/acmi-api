Featuring an electrifying performance by Mitchell in the title role, and a wonderful set of songs which manage to pay homage to both punk and old theatrical musicals, &#8220;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&#8221; is a defiant celebration of independence and gender confusion. Made on a miniscule budget, the film boasts inventive art direction and design. Mitchell&#8217;s perseverance and courage has paid off. The film has won numerous international film awards including a special prize at the Berlin Film Festival 2001 and the Audience Award and the Best Director Award at the Sundance Film Festival, 2001.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English", "Greek"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Germany (East)", "Closed captioning", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gay and lesbian studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transsexualism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Transvestism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "History&nbsp;→ Berlin (Germany) - History - Division of East and West", "Literature&nbsp;→ Drama - Adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Musicals", "Places&nbsp;→ Germany (East)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/hedwig-and-the-angry-inch", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997285, "name": "John Cameron Mitchell", "creator_id": 54572, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q443995", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997284, "name": "Christine Vachon", "creator_id": 51131, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q436847", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997283, "name": "Katie Roumel", "creator_id": 55197, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997282, "name": "Pamela Koffler", "creator_id": 51166, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997281, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997280, "name": "Killer Films", "creator_id": 71715, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997279, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50765", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32728], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93221, "acmi_id": "316627", "title": "The American Film Institute salute to Fred Astaire", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-american-film-institute-salute-to-fred-astaire", "creator_credit": "Marty Pasetta, George Stevens Jr and American Film Institute", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1981", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This series from the American Film Institute (AFI) salutes some of the biggest stars that helped to shape the face of Hollywood as we know it today.

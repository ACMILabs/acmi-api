Clear, instructive diagrams and photography are used to illustrate that weather is not random, but the result of the formation of big entities in the earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Looks at the horse latitudes, Hadley cells, temperate zones, polar cells, trade winds, jet streams, fronts and depressions, the water cycle and humidity in the creation of various climates. &#8220;Lightning&#8221; is a very complete description, supported by exceptional photographs and film of lightning creation and behaviour, long regarded as the &#8220;longest unsolved problem of classical physics&#8221;. Contains first hand accounts of being hit by lightning and ways to minimize risk. &#8220;Hurricanes&#8221; (typhoons, cyclones) are more costly and claim more lives than any other type of storm. This episode shows how they develop and what determines their path and force/speed.

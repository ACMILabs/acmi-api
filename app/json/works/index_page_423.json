The first program explores the period in Chinese history between the 1920s through to the 1940s, seen through the eyes of the people living in Shanghai, as the country moved from the colonial rule of the English and Japanese and the disjointed rule of the warlords to a unification movement led by the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek and subsequent attempts by the Japanese to regain control. The second two part program covers the history of Communist China from the mid 1930s to the 1960s, where the chinese Communists retreated following defeat by the Nationalists in the walk later known as the Long March, only to regroup and counter attack in the form of the Peoples Liberation Army to drive the Nationalists out of power and to exile in Taiwan.

Part one begins in the north of China in Yunan, where the chinese Communists retreated following defeat by the Nationalists in 1934 in a year long walk later known and promoted as the Long March. The program discusses the rise of Mao Tse-tung from a teacher of philosophy to a political leader as the communists regrouped and experimented with political ideas under continued bombardment from the Japanese and from the Nationalists in the form of economic blockades even in their unification against the Japanese. In 1942 the rectification campaign saw the Nationalist&#8217;s fostering links with the United States, links which cooled to favour the Communists after a short time until the surrender of the Japanese and the end of the war. By 1947 the Communists had secured a great deal of power in Northern China until civil war came to Yunan and Mao and the red army took to the hills to await the strength and opportunity to take over from the Nationalists. Part two details this counter attack when the People&#8217;s Liberation Army became a conventional force of some half a million soldiers which gradually took over China from the North, taking popular land reform ideals with them and becoming stronger as a result. By 1948 the Nationalists were in full retreat and the Communists declared victory in 1949 after they entered Beijing. The program then discusses the short lived links with Russia and the move away from tradition through new laws and social reforms, including a new marriage law and the instigation of uniformity of costume and education. The second part closes with a discussion of the widening gap between the dream and reality of the Yunan Communist spirit as the grim reality behind the ideas of industrialisation in the &#8220;Great Leap Forward&#8221; and the crushing of opposition through an anti-rightest campaign became evident in the early 1960s.

Part one opens with Shanghai in the 1920s, a centre of foreign trade and colonialist occupation by the English and Japanese, disjointed rule of the country at the hands of warlords and the beginning of a concerted Nationalist and unification movement under the direction of Chiang Kai-Shek. The program discusses Chiang Kai-Shek and his KMT troops as they battled and defeated the warlords across China to unify the country under a Nationalist flag and outlines the growing opposition to foreign ownership and occupation and a reign of terror against them that also included those who had been made wealthy from foreign trade and saw an influx of these people to the International settlement in the relative safety of Shang-hai. The explosive Nationalist atmosphere of the time is also depicted through coverage of the &#8220;White Terror&#8221; which resulted in the execution of thousands of suspected communists in the country as the definitive drive for national unification increased. Part two discusses Shanghai under Nationalist rule where the left movement still thrived but under careful auspices of representing Nationalist ideals and where the strength of Japan as a ruler over China&#8217;s economy became ever more pointed in the puppet government of the Last Emperor and the Japanese invasion of Shang-hai in 1932. The program then outlines the subsequent humiliation of a truce with Japan and the rise to power in Northern China of the powerful son of a warlord that aligned himself with Chiang Kai-Shek and heightened the Nationalist&#8217;s campaigning and instigated an attempt to oust Japan which eventually consumed the country in a 12 year war with Japan which failed for the Nationalists but became a foundation for a rising tide of Communism. This comphrehensive documentary uses rare archival footage, interviews with the chinese and ex-patriot people of the time and coverage of the impact of this stage in China&#8217;s history on contemporary China and Taiwan to tell the story of this complex period of 20th century Chinese history.

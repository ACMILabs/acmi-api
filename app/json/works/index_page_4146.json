The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America. Near the end of the film Billy shows a few scenes from ‘Stanley Park’ in Vancouver, Canada which included the ‘Zoo and children’s farmyard’ at the time, which has since been closed.</p>\n<p>Selected

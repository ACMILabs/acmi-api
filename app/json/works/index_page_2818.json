This high quality comedy is notable for its madcap humour, absurd situations and the disaster-prone adventures of Lucy. &#8220;Lucy does a TV commercial&#8221; airing in 1952 shows just how far Lucy will go to appear in a commercial on a show that Ricky is presenting. The commercial is for a highly alcoholic health product which Lucy drinks over and over during rehearsal. &#8220;Lucy&#8217;s Italian Movie&#8221; airing in 1956 has Lucy being spotted by a famous Italian film director while travelling on a train headed for Rome. Taking the role very seriously and without knowing what the role actually is Lucy finds herself crushing grapes with her feet with the locals in a vineyard.

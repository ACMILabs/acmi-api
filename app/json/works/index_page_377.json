Eleven year old Seymour is bored during the school holidays, living with his fussy guardian in Richmond. His world changes when he meets the fabulous Angie, a young woman who treats him with respect and loving attention. They begin a friendship which is initially fun until Seymour comes to understand that his friend is a heroin user, and her life not as carefree and safe as he initially believed. Lowenstein&#8217;s gift for understanding the specificicities of subculture make this a moving film about families and contemporary dislocation. Sudi de Winter is excellent as Angie and Mickey Camilleri is the shy child Seymour. Co-stars Ben Mendelsohn.

Jonathon Mole is a bigoted law clerk who considers himself a victimised average citizen. One night, Jonathan dreams of a &#8216;perfect&#8217; nation where he is elevated to the status of judge and is presented with a case testing a law which reserves the most desired vocations to person&#8217;s of &#8216;pure&#8217; racial origin. Witnesses for the Prosecution present easily recognizable stereotypes of prejudice and witnesses for the Defence counter with undeniable facts.

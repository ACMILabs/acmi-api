Theo, a projectionist in the local theatre, steals a car belonging to lovers Rebecca and Marco and takes it for a joyride. He collides with the car of a local farmer gravely injuring his daughter, but due to a short term memory loss, leaves the scene without helping the injured girl or her family. Later he becomes involved with Laura, a nurse, who has been taking care of the girl. Both couples are rootless and without ambition or drive, and Tywker uses the time allowed by his elliptical narrative to compare and contrast the two relationships on display. He deploys stylistic formalism to make connections between what are essentially shallow characters. Their incompatibilities are underpinned by the use of colour-coding, while the repeated use of lap dissolves sets up unexpected connections between them. Cast includes Floriane Daniel, Heino Ferch, Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem and Josef Bierbichler. In German with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:04:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["German"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Color cinematography", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Traffic accidents", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amnesia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Short-term memory", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 957966, "name": "X filme creative Pool", "creator_id": 31083, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957967, "name": "Filmstiftung NRW", "creator_id": 31084, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957968, "name": "FilmFernsehFonds Bayern", "creator_id": 31085, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957969, "name": "Palladio Film", "creator_id": 31086, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957970, "name": "WDR", "creator_id": 29452, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957971, "name": "Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk", "creator_id": 31087, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957972, "name": "Arte", "creator_id": 30115, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957973, "name": "BMI", "creator_id": 31088, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957974, "name": "Bavaria Film", "creator_id": 71485, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957975, "name": "FFA - Filmforderungsanstalt", "creator_id": 31089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957976, "name": "German Independents", "creator_id": 31090, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957977, "name": "Stefan Arndt", "creator_id": 31091, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 957978, "name": "Tom Tykwer", "creator_id": 4888, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 957965, "name": "Heathcliff", "creator_id": 77198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46160", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [28647]}, {"id": 96733, "acmi_id": "504712", "title": "Winter of the witch", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "winter-of-the-witch", "creator_credit": "Parents' Magazine Films, Learning Corporation of America, Thomas Sand and Gerald Herman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1969", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Nicky and his mother buy an old house where a three hundred-year-old witch lives.

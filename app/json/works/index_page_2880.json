When it opened in London in October 1985, at the Barbican Theatre, it opened to mixed reviews, but went on to silence the critics and is now one of the most successful musical shows of all time. &#8220;Les Miserables&#8221; is either in production or development in over seventy cities of the world. The success continues. A symphonic recording of the complete score is being released worldwide and a film version of the musical is in development. Using performance footage from the London, Oslo, Budapest and Viennese productions, this program celebrates this phenomenal success and discusses its progress with its writers, directors and producers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Musicals - Production and direction", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ French literature - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 899955, "name": "Telstar Independent Programs", "creator_id": 22900, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 899956, "name": "Martin Cox", "creator_id": 22901, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 899957, "name": "Trevor Nunn", "creator_id": 22902, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 899958, "name": "John Caird", "creator_id": 76730, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "36643", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [20306], "external_references": []}, {"id": 116319, "acmi_id": "X000532", "title": "Les Miserables (TV Version)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "les-miserables-tv-version", "creator_credit": "Marcel Bluwal", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Imprisoned for stealing a loaf of bread, Jean Valjean&#8217;s life is transformed by an act of forgiveness.

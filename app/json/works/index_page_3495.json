The documentary contains interviews with artists&#8217; families, art critics, historians, and art students, curators and journalists of the time and a detailed analysis of the lives of the condemned artists and innovative art movements such as the Expressionist and Bauhaus school that they represented. These elements, combined with a broad based study of Hitler&#8217;s rise to power, and the social, cultural and political impact of the Nazi leadership on Germany, provides a striking perspective on the mass persuasion techniques, suppression, targeting of, and aggression towards, alternative views or unrecognised groups during Hitler&#8217;s dictatorship. It also considers the consequences of this history for the future of German art.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Hitler, Adolf, 1889-1945", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Abstract expressionism", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Germany", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and society", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Abstract", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Classical", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, European", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 20th century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Expressionism (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Graffiti", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Politics in art - Germany", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politics in art - Germany", "History&nbsp;→ Depressions - 1929", "History&nbsp;→ Goebbels, Joseph, 1897-1945", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Hitler, Adolf, 1889-1945", "People&nbsp;→ Goebbels, Joseph, 1897-1945", "People&nbsp;→ Hitler, Adolf, 1889-1945", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 815735, "name": "David Grubin", "creator_id": 24572, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 815734, "name": "LA County Museum of Art", "creator_id": 35234, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 815733, "name": "David Grubin", "creator_id": 24572, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 815732, "name": "VEA", "creator_id": 21531, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51057", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [32991]}, {"id": 76011, "acmi_id": "013722", "title": "Degas in the Metropolitan", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "degas-in-the-metropolitan", "creator_credit": "Jehane Burns, Ray Eames, Charles Eames and Metropolitan Museum of Art", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This brilliant comprehensive study of French artist Edgar Degas takes us on a leisurely tour through the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s extraordinary collection of his works.

The plot follows Tom as he is kicked out of home and travels to London, pursued by the woman he loves. There are plenty of adventures along the way, including much feasting, heaving of breasts, sword fighting and a masked ball, just to name a few. The truth of Jones&#8217; parentage is always in question, he doesn&#8217;t even know who his real parents are. None of the hardships faced during Tom&#8217;s adventure bother him and it&#8217;s not often that the smile leaves his attractive face. Based on the classic novel by Henry Fielding, this precursor to &#8216;Alvin Purple&#8217; is both satirical and bawdy.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Italy - Venice - Awards", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/tom-jones", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1994744, "name": "Tony Richardson", "creator_id": 62037, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q52411", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994743, "name": "Woodfall Film Productions", "creator_id": 61992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47775", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [30021]}, {"id": 90505, "acmi_id": "313475", "title": "No skin off my ass (E)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "no-skin-off-my-ass-e", "creator_credit": "Bruce LaBruce, Jurgen Bruning and Gaytown Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44367, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7044978"}], "brief_description": "<p>One of the first important works of the &#8220;New Queer Cinema&#8221;, this acerbic and very witty black comedy is a bout a gay hairdresser (LaBruce) who falls in love with a young skinhead.

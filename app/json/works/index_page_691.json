Challenged to a sword fight by the marquis, Moreau takes refuge in a theatrical troupe, posing as the clown - Scaramouche. Being in disguise provides Moreau with the time to take fencing lessons from swordmaster Doutreval (John Dehner), as well as romancing his leading lady, Lenore (Eleanor Parker).

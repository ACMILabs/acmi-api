In an effort to understand the appeal of this movement, the documentary delves into the history of Vlad Tsepes (Dracul), the 15th century warrior-prince whom Stoker based the character of Dracula upon. To explore this phenomenon further, there are interviews with Nicholas Strathloch, who claims to come from a long line of vampires and drinks human blood, Kathy and Dale McKinley, who claim to be able to channel the spirit of Vlad Tsepes, and Catrina Coffin, who lives like a vampire. Opinions are also sought from a diverse array of people including a theologian, a psychiatrist, an author, a member of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula, a hypnotist and a psychic.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Immortality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Blood", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Blood donors", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Religious aspects", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Immortality", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1811043, "name": "Terry Spencer", "creator_id": 32664, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 807178, "name": "Towers Productions", "creator_id": 32662, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 807177, "name": "Discovery Video", "creator_id": 24624, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079359", "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48401", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [30563]}, {"id": 74281, "acmi_id": "011438", "title": "Value analysis", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "value-analysis", "creator_credit": "Sam Napier-Bell, Leon Clore and Basic Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1964", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Value analysis is a disciplined approach to cost reduction by the systematic examination and appraisal of the product and its components.

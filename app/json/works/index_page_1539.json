Twelve year-old Yusef (Mohammad Nahhal) lives in a refugee camp with his mother and older sister. His father is in prison and his older brother is on the run from the Israeli soldiers. To escape the surrounding violence Yusef constantly lives in an imaginary world, but it is his bird hunting in the near-by countryside that allows Yusef a sense of freedom and space. It is here that Yusef meets Aida (Hana Nemah), the wild and lovely young gypsy girl from a local gypsy camp, whose beguiling eyes and smile Yusef finds hard to resist. He soon declares his love for Aida telling her he will marry her when they grow up. However Aida sets a task for Yusef before she will agree to marriage, that being he must first find three jewels missing from her grandmother&#8217;s necklace, which was brought from South America by her grandfather.

When Helen impulsively marries her current boyfriend, Jo is turned out and moves in with Geoffrey, a kindly homosexual friend, himself an outsider. Their peaceful domesticity is interrupted when Jo falls pregnant after an affair with a black sailor. After the birth of the baby, Jo and Geoffrey are effectively co-parenting until Jo&#8217;s opportunistic mother re-emerges to stake her claim in her daughter&#8217;s life. Despite its depressing subject matter &#8220;A Taste of honey&#8221; entertains a blackly comic tone that keeps it from sliding into a draining melodrama. The film is a fascinating &#8216;slice-of-life&#8217; view of working class life in Britain of the 60s, whose entrancing black and white cinematography, reminiscent of Bill Brandt&#8217;s photography of working class England, contrasts with the gauche and drab reality of the characters&#8217; surrounds. This controversial film dealt with many taboo topics on the day - teen pregnancy, inter-racial romance, homosexuality, child abandonment, without excessive sermonising on the topics, typical of American moral dramas of the 1950s.

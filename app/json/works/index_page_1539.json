In danger of losing Phuong to the American, Fowler is drawn into a suspicious and venomous state, convinced that the American is supplying explosives to non-Communist troops. &#8220;The Quiet American&#8221; leaves the more contentious political elements of Graham Greene&#8217;s novel to languish in favour of highlighting the personal grief of a middle-aged man in crisis. Redgrave is impressive as Fowler, whose voice-over narration relays comprehension of his fate, and his disastrous attempt to fight it.

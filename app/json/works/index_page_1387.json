of the 1940s to 1960s. Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, Ted captures a trip to Queensland and New South Wales. The film features scenes of holidaying in Queensland, touring around Surfers Paradise, Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast and Coffs Harbour, before travelling down the East Coast from Sydney to Eden and Lakes Entrance. The film includes memorable scenes such as a show of aqua ballet and water ski stunts in Surfers Paradise, dolphins in the Pet Porpoise Pool in Coffs Harbour, historic buildings in Brisbane and fruit farms on the Sunshine Coast.</p>\n<p>Of particular interest is Lennon’s Hotel in Broadbeach, which was one of the earliest hotels in Surfers Paradise. At the time, there were few buildings around and the hotel was surrounded by stretches of sand dunes and unsealed roads.

The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons.

The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons.

Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures the visit of Australian champion golfer Peter Thomson to the Wangaratta Golf Club in 1956. As shown by the poster in the film, Thomson teaches a golf clinic to an avid crowd. At the time, Thomson had won the British Open twice, and would go on to win it a total of five times - he was the first Australian golfer to win the championship and the only man to have won it in three consecutive years in the twentieth century (1954, 1955 and 1956).</p>\n<p>The film shows off the lovely surrounds of the Golf Club set against the backdrop of the town itself and in particular, the backyards of houses.

the early 1970s. Born in Budapest, Hungary, Tibor lived in Melbourne, Victoria with his family. His wife Merna Koller was a frequent collaborator on these films, showing a shared interest in filmmaking.</p>\n<p>Tibor captured suburban family life in Melbourne, including family celebrations, urban scenes and regional holidays. Tibor was actively engaged in the lapidary society of Australia. Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller.

By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This is a particularly lovely colour film comprising scenes from Ron and Jess Gadsden&#8217;s early life when their children were small, in 1952. They are enjoying life at home (Lansell Rd, Toorak in Melbourne), sitting in the sun with the children, on the beach at Frankston on the Mornington Peninsula and a birthday for one of the girls back at Lansell Rd.</p>\n<p>The second half of the film shows school sports at the Geelong Grammar Toorak Campus, &#8216;Glamorgan&#8217;, which Ron films through a round frame.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:59:00 Jess Gadsden teaches one of her children to swim in shallows at Frankston beach<br />\n00:01:59:00 view of

Coltrane also performed with Dizzy Gillespie, playing Bebop, and legendary pianist Thelonius Monk. As well as containing live footage, this work probes Coltrane&#8217;s interest in the science of sound, the philosophy of music espoused within many Eastern cultures, ideas to which Coltrane was drawn as he expressed spiritual issues through his art. Exploration into notions of Eastern modality resulted in extended solos, which influenced jazz, contemporary classical music and even rock. This documentary examines Coltrane&#8217;s music in the 1960s as a reflection of the massive changes wrought within American society, particularly in regards to incendiary race relations. Features the voice of Alice Coltrane, discussing her husband and the links between his spirituality and music, and interviews with various friends and colleagues, including Roscoe Mitchell, Rashied Ali, Tommy Flanagan, Jimmy Heath, Wayne Shorter and La Monte Young.

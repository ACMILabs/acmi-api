Rachael travels the Victorian countryside in her Kombi and describes her camping trips as &#8216;more comfortable than being at home&#8217;. David, a Kombi enthusiast for over 30 years, is fascinated by the van&#8217;s early beginnings as an economical utilities vehicle in occupied Germany during World War II. Some tell of their love of the Kombi&#8217;s idiosyncratic design, &#8216;I love the box shape because it&#8217;s such a practical thing to put things in&#8217;. Andrew lovingly restores Kombis and believes &#8216;once you&#8217;re bitten by it, it never really goes away, once you own one you really wouldn&#8217;t want to own any other sort of car&#8217;. And Jan has learned to love Kombis again after her former partner smashed her newly restored Kombi to pieces with a wood splitter. But perhaps Ben sums it up best when he explains that being a Kombi devotee means that &#8216;you are someone who enjoys the journey as much as the destination&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:25:31:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["ACMI classified", "Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Automobiles - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 1}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2676773, "name": "Charles Coates", "creator_id": 8937, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2676772, "name": "Charles Coates", "creator_id": 8937, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2676775, "name": "Janine Harrison", "creator_id": 8938, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "SP Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-2 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2117", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [53618]}, {"id": 64573, "acmi_id": "000163", "title": "Africa: the land and its people.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film shows people enjoying the water and sunshine at the former State Swimming Centre (now demolished) in Batman Avenue, Melbourne. Being 1943, those enjoying the Olympic-sized pool and its facilities include soldiers in uniform as well as those displaying the various swimwear styles of the 1940s. There are sequences of diving from the high diving-boards, underwater scenes, and people sunbaking, swimming and enjoying themselves bring the reel to a close. Throughout the reel, many people react to the camera by smiling and posing for it, while others appear less enthusiastic about being photographed. The footage also shows glimpses of landmark buildings of Melbourne at the time.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:</p>\n<p>00:00:09:00 title &#8216;Olympic Pool Melbourne 1943&#8217;. The open-air Olympic Pool (formally known as the State Swimming Centre) was built by the Melbourne City Council, and opened in Batman Avenue, Melbourne in 1935. It was Melbourne&#8217;s first Olympic-sized pool, and was also known as the Beaurepaire Pool (named after champion swimmer Sir Frank Beaurepaire who was also Melbourne&#8217;s Lord Mayor 1940-1942).</p>\n<p>00:00:25:00 we see the pool and some of its surrounding seating and walkways.

the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight.

One of the most memorable advertising jingles at the time was ‘Up, Up and away, with TAA, the Friendly, Friendly Way…’, a variation on the 1967 song Up, Up and Away, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline TWA.</p>\n<p>At home in Herne Hill, new baby Stuart is introduced to the camera, in his ‘bassinette’, laughing at the camera, bouncing in a ‘bouncinette’, in his bath, in his ‘highchair’ and sitting on big sister Karen’s lap.

Images of the architecture, temples, cultural traditions and ceremonies are also a highlight. The film shows pottery techniques and a pottery ware market. There is footage of a funeral procession and a traditional Balinese temple festival or Odalan.

The film also shows dancers preparing and dressing for a Djanger Dance Performance, and a Kris dance is performed by men and children on a dirt road in Bali.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List (time codes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:00:10:00 passenger liner leaving Port of Sydney Harbour; onlookers farewelling passengers with streamers; Dalgety and Co Ltd sheds along the wharf<br />\n00:01:57:00 view from the deck of the liner of Balinese people in traditional canoe, juking, cadik  <br />\n00:02:47:00 Balinese market stalls<br />\n00:02:55:00 Balinese market crowded with local people<br />\n00:03:13:00 Balinese market stall holders trading<br />\n00:03:29:00 Balinese temple<br />\n00:03:44:00 Balinese farmer ploughs rice field with oxen<br />\n00:03:52:00 Balinese rice terrace with workers<br />\n00:04:15:00 old Balinese man stands in front of temple shrine<br />\n00:04:20:00 Balinese children and women crowd the steps of a temple<br />\n00:04:46:00 Balinese tourist guide interacts with Western tourists at a temple<br />\n00:05:01:00 two Balinese men stand overlooking a rice terrace<br />\n00:05:34:00 a Balinese wedding with wedding guests arriving on foot along a dirt road<br />\n00:05:42:00 wedding guests enter through a gate<br />\n00:05:50:00 the groom walks down the road towards the wedding<br />\n00:06:03:00 groom sits with the priest and receives blessings accompanied by various rituals and incense<br />\n00:06:32:00 Balinese man carrying a child on his hip<br />\n00:06:51:00 learning the Kris dance with Balinese men and children in the street<br />\n00:07:02:00 dirt road crowded with children and women<br />\n00:07:17:00 Gamelan Gong orchestra playing for the Legong Dance<br />\n00:07:43:00 Legong Dance Performance<br />\n00:08:52:00 women dressing and preparing for the Djanger Dance<br />\n00:09:00:00 Balinese children playing in the dirt<br />\n00:09:08:00 women preparing a dance performance – rubbing oil into their skin, putting on sarongs, wrapping fabric around their midriff<br />\n00:09:38:00 women dressing for the dance<br />\n00:09:59:00 musicians accompanying seated women dancers<br />\n00:10:07:00 seated men and women perform dance<br />\n00:10:29:00 a solo dancer enters the seated circle<br />\n00:10:46:00 dancers perform for Western tourists<br />\n00:10:54:00 masked dancer performs for Western tourists<br />\n00:11:26:00 dancer points bow and arrow at masked dancer</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:11:49:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Bali Island (Indonesia)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Bali Island (Indonesia) - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indonesia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Indonesia - Social life and customs", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Indonesia - Social conditions", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Weddings", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance", "Places&nbsp;→ Bali Island (Indonesia)", "Places&nbsp;→ Indonesia", "Places&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Sydney Harbour (N.S.W.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2058840, "name": "Orwell Michaelis", "creator_id": 85085, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "174397", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}, {"id": 6, "name": "Indonesia", "slug": "indonesia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1939", "notes": "", "to_year": "1939"}], "labels": [58678]}]}

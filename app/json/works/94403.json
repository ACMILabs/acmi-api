This is the story of two Palestinian children born and raised in the Shatila Camp - Farah aged 11 and Issa aged 12.

Farah and Issa are delightful in their naturalness and through their own personal narratives about family background and daily life and interviews with family and friends, there is a sense that for all the poverty, tragedy and death that surrounds them, the girls are amazingly pragmatic in their attitude.

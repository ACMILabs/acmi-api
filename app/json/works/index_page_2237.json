In his film &#8220;Afterlife&#8221; (1978), Ishu Patel used plasticine spread over glass, before carving and moulding the clay for each new shot, then lit it from behind, to create a surreal and dream-like vision of life after death. In &#8220;Bead game&#8221;, Patel manipulated thousands of beads, to create swirling and magical patterns, telling a story of global violence. Using traditional graphic and watercolour and pinhole techniques, Patel created &#8220;Paradise&#8221; - the story of a blackbird&#8217;s quest for beauty.

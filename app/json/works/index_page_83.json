But like all fairy tales, where good and evil battle it out, Hobbs has his own demons to deal with in the form of knockers, corruption and those who would wish to see him, and the New York Knights, fail. The story climaxes to a tense and spectacular final sequence as our hero takes the bat in a nail-biting challenge to win the pennant for his Knights. This is not a film to be taken too seriously and there are many holes in the plot, but it features a wonderful cast including Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey, Richard Farnsworth and an uncredited appearance by Darren McGavin.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Heroes", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Baseball", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Heroes", "People&nbsp;→ Heroes"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-natural", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963757, "name": "Tri-Star Pictures", "creator_id": 22768, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963758, "name": "Delphi II", "creator_id": 36200, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963759, "name": "Mark Johnson", "creator_id": 72110, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963760, "name": "Barry Levinson", "creator_id": 72109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52178", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [33797], "external_references": [{"id": 1673, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1197684"}, {"id": 6100, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "11393"}]}, {"id": 89557, "acmi_id": "312365", "title": "The Naked truth = Your past is showing", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-naked-truth-your-past-is-showing", "creator_credit": "Rank Organisation Film Productions and Mario Zampi", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A satire of the tabloid-press industry, &#8220;The Naked Truth&#8221; focuses on a scandal-sheet publisher, Nigel Dennis, who gets rich by disclosing lurid details of the private lives of wealthy prominent people.

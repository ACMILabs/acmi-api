While Henry James&#8217; novel leaves little doubt that they have been possessed by the demonic souls of the previous governess and her valet lover, who had died on the estate after an illicit sadomasochistic relationship, the film entertains the possibility that the supernatural events experienced by the governess are merely the product of her vivid imagination. Clayton cleverly uses startling imagery and nerve-bending sound to terrify the audience.

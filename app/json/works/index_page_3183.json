Cade was a POW in Changi during World War II and during his time there he made the link between mental illness and body chemistry. At the time there were no other treatments for the mentally ill other than shock treatment, lobotomy and institutionalisation. With his wife and two young sons (who grew up in the grounds of a hospital), Cade&#8217;s research done whilst a doctor in residence, paved the way for the current treatment of bi-polar disorder and for chemical treatment of the mentally ill.

While her husband was still in good favour with the revolutionary army, she was the vice-director of the woman&#8217;s liberation group.

The narrative is centred on the relationship between mother and son, who are faced with the hardships and poverty of life in China.

The war represented an ideological split between the Western-supported Nationalist KMT and the Soviet-supported Communist CPC. The civil war carried on intermittently until the Second Sino-Japanese War interrupted it, resulting in the two parties forming a Second United Front. Japan&#8217;s campaign was defeated in 1945, marking the end of World War II, and China&#8217;s full-scale civil war resumed in 1946. After a further four years, 1950 saw a cessation of major hostilities—with the newly founded People&#8217;s Republic of China controlling mainland China, and the Republic of China&#8217;s jurisdiction being restricted to Taiwan (and its surrounding islands). To this day, since no armistice has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.<br />\n&#8220;The Gang of Four&#8221; was the name given to a leftist political faction composed of four Chinese Communist Party officials who came into prominence during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), and were subsequently charged with a series of treasonous crimes. The Gang of Four, together with disgraced Communist general Lin Biao, were labelled the two major &#8220;counter-revolutionary forces&#8221; of the Cultural Revolution and officially blamed for the worst excesses of the societal chaos that ensued during the ten years of turmoil.

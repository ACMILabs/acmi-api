Written in collaboration with OpenAI’s GPT-3 trained on key texts of fantasy and the philosophy of language, ‘The Building’ is realised in 3D sound and vision by Daniel Jenatsch, performed by artist and philosopher Franziska Aigner and brought to the world by full stack web developer Tim Busuttil. In the spirit of collaboration, ‘The Building’ explores the imaginative capacity of AI and its unique voice in intersection with our own.</p>\n<p><i>The Close World – The Building</i> is a further iteration of a larger body of work by Daniel Jenatsch. This is the first time Jenatsch has ever considered making a playable video-based work, and he imagines that different iterations and further developments of ‘The Building’ will be released at different times across the exhibition period.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Daniel Jenatsch<br />\nDigital artwork<br />\nACMI Commission</p>", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2524325, "name": "Daniel Jenatsch", "creator_id": 87019, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2524326, "name": "Tim Busuttil", "creator_id": 87043, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "developer", "role_id": 658, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2524327, "name": "Franziska Aigner", "creator_id": 87044, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "192969", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2023", "notes": "", "to_year": "2023"}], "labels": [61326]}, {"id": 121855, "acmi_id": "Z000201", "title": "More Than Just a Game", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "more-than-just-a-game", "creator_credit": "Jarra Karalinar Steel", "credit_line": "<p>Commissioned by ACMI</p>", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2022", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 4", "last_on_display_date": "2023-02-19", "is_context_indigenous": true, "material_description": "Videogame, arcade machine handcrafted from reclaimed Australian blackwood, LED lettering, custom flooring", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2022-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": true, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>“Just like in the arcade games of the past, the government initiatives that exist are currently about us, without us.

One brother is a law abiding citizen who looks after a wealthy bedridden old lady in his spare time and tries desperately to win over the Greek immigrant parents of his girlfriend. The other is a likeable but dangerously off-the-wall criminal type who is sheltered by his ditzy pregnant girlfriend. A confrontation with the police and their Greek counterparts tears everything apart. The clash of cultures and turfs is a strong element in the story, which generally roars along with a mixture of comedy, violence and drama.

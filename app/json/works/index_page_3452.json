The exhibition took place at St Carthage’s Catholic Church in Parkville and the film features a short introduction by John Kaldor and interviews with Bill Viola and Father Michael Elligate.</p>\n<p>Bill Viola has been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art. For over 40 years he has created videotapes, architectural video installations, sound environments, electronic music performances, flat panel video pieces and works for television broadcast. His video installations, total environments that envelop the viewer in image and sound, employ state-of-the-art technologies and are distinguished by their precision and direct simplicity.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and motion pictures", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and religion", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 21st century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists' materials", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Cathedrals", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Installations (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 840867, "name": "ACMI", "creator_id": 6272, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 840868, "name": "Kim Montgomery", "creator_id": 8660, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840869, "name": "Jason White", "creator_id": 73899, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840870, "name": "David Meagher", "creator_id": 10916, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840871, "name": "David Meagher", "creator_id": 10916, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840872, "name": "Bill Viola", "creator_id": 6438, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "interviewee", "role_id": 496, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "154963", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "04 OCT 2010", "notes": "", "to_year": "04 OCT 2010"}], "labels": [56552], "external_references": []}, {"id": 67538, "acmi_id": "003718", "title": "Fire without smoke", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fire-without-smoke", "creator_credit": "Central Office of Information and Dept of Scientific and Industrial Research", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1952", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1952-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Traces the development of a simple but effective device for abolishing the industrial smoke menace.

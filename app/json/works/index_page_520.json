Co-starring Jean-Pierre Lorit and Frederique Feder. In French with English subtitles. Cinematography, Piotr Sobockinski. Editing, Jacques Witta. Music, Zbigniew Preisner. Screenplay, Krzysztof Piesiewicz and Krzysztof Kieslowski.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Judges", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Models, Fashion", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961795, "name": "Krzysztof Kieslowski", "creator_id": 25379, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961794, "name": "Marin Karmitz", "creator_id": 22337, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961793, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961792, "name": "TOR Film Studio", "creator_id": 27080, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961791, "name": "CAB Productions SA", "creator_id": 27079, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961790, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961789, "name": "MK2 Productions", "creator_id": 27077, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961788, "name": "Electric Shadows", "creator_id": 78863, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19850, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5YIzZaQlwYJY5ZEqHRs9dG9DduB.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Three colours red = Trois couleurs rouge  (Krzysztof Kieslowski) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50693", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32659]}]}

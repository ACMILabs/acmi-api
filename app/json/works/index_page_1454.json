In this anarchic setting, rogue gangs menacingly roam the land in search of petrol (a vital and increasingly scarce resource), spoils of looting and bloodthirsty fun. Mel Gibson stars as Max Rockatansky, a good cop made mad by the death of his wife and child and the hands of a gang of feral bikies. The film follows Max as he embarks on a personal vendetta to avenge the death of his family, armed with anger, a gun and his car - &#8220;the last of the V-8 interceptors&#8221;. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; has a much-imitated visual and thematic style - gang members are clad in filthy rags with maimed bodies; the landscape is bleak and featureless; camps are transitory pit-stops between war zones; and machines rule their owners. &#8220;Mad Max&#8221;, with its ordinary hero and car culture narrative, fits neatly into the zeitgeist of 1970s filmmaking. A nihilistic road movie, fuelled by male angst, &#8220;Mad Max&#8221; is a thrilling, truly original film that remains a highlight of Australian film history.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Automobiles", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Motor vehicles", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Automobiles - Social aspects", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mad-max", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1984052, "name": "George Miller", "creator_id": 66844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984051, "name": "Byron Kennedy", "creator_id": 66841, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984050, "name": "Kennedy Miller Productions", "creator_id": 66822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1984049, "name": "Mad Max Films", "creator_id": 1986, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1984055, "name": "Hugh Keays-Byrne", "creator_id": 76205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1984054, "name": "Joanne Samuel", "creator_id": 76442, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1984053, "name": "Mel Gibson", "creator_id": 76439, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1984048, "name": "Video Classroom", "creator_id": 20016, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35169", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1978", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1978"}], "labels": [18849], "external_references": [{"id": 23895, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q248775"}]}, {"id": 88386, "acmi_id": "310947", "title": "Lulu on the bridge", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "lulu-on-the-bridge", "creator_credit": "Paul Auster, Amy Kaufman, Greg Johnson, Peter Newman and Redeemable Features", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Writer Paul Auster made his solo directorial debut with this romantic drama that combines myth and realism in a form of storytelling that is both simple and complex.

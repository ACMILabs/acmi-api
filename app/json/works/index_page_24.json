Born in 1953, he grew up on an Aboriginal reserve and worked as a stockman. Possessing exceptional talents as a dancer, at age 14 he was chosen to play the lead in Nicholas Roeg&#8217;s film &#8216;Walkabout&#8217; (1970). He went on to act in a number of Australian feature films including &#8216;Mad Dog Morgan&#8217; (1976), &#8216;Storm Boy&#8217; (1977), &#8216;The Last Wave&#8217; (1977), &#8216;Crocodile Dundee&#8217; (1986) and &#8216;Rabbit-Proof Fence&#8217; (2002). Most recently he won the AFI award for best actor for his performance in &#8216;The Tracker&#8217; (2002). When he is not acting, Gulpilil lives a demanding traditional life in Arnhem Land, Northern Australia where he is an elder of the Yolngu clan. Following Gulpilil from the set of &#8216;The Tracker&#8217; back to his community the film reveals how the actor negotiates the two very different worlds he moves between.

Upon arrival, the girls are instantly averse to their strange, rather grotesque new world, and decide to take matters into their own hands by attempting an escape and return home.

He opts for an even-handed portrayal of the past, steering clear of images of oppression or subjugation and any chastising of White Culture, and instead emphasises optimism and survival.

Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 1 of this extraordinary collection corresponds to the first 11 minutes of the official State Film Centre release (see ACMI Collection Title [315392]) &#8220;The Visit to Victoria of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh&#8221;. It shows some of the preparations for the visit, the arrival by plane of the royal couple at Essendon Airport and their first progress through Melbourne to State Parliament and Government House. We see the Queen opening State Parliament, visiting the MCG to meet with Australian armed servicemen and women, attending a special race meeting at Flemington Racecourse and a Davis Cup game at Kooyong Tennis Centre.

Kenneth sets up a beginning sequence where we see Bettye and Bob and Mrs Rankine gazing at above at the sky looking (as we realise) for the stork to deliver the baby.</p>\n<p>00:07:30:00 Kenneth Robert has arrived and there are lots of shots of him as a very happy baby in the sunny family garden.</p>\n<p>00:08:04:00 Kenneth devises some scenes where Bob Wootton is polishing a car that suddenly turns in to a larger car that he then shows off to Mrs Rankine and Bettye. Cars feature in Kenneth&#8217;s films including a scene here where he and Bob reverse the wide cars down the narrow driveway which was typical of the house style at the time.</p>\n<p>00:12:18:00 a title for the baby at one year old showing height, chest, weight and number of teeth. We immediately see footage of what is likely to be the baby christening at what appears to be a country church.</p>\n<p>00:13:15:00 showing us the baby now crawling on a rug in the family garden.</p>\n<p>00:14:28:00 the baby is sitting playing with a ‘Kool Mints’ tin, playing with water, clapping with his mother and being tickled; the baby being fed what appears to be sugar on a plastic spoon gripped in his teeth to cover his nose, sitting on his stroller and learning to walk between his parents;</p>\n<p>00:17:10:00 the baby walks independently and soon after is tottering around the garden.</p>\n<p>00:17:46:00 with another flower to separate scenes, we see the baby sliding around the garden on a spade being held by his father, running with a pull-along toy, riding around on a broom; playing with a balloon that bursts, looking quite confident with the camera, playing with a spinning top.</p>\n<p>00:19:37:00 title card for the baby at two which includes height and weight followed by a brief shot of the toddler ending with a final flower.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:54:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Social life and customs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Weddings", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "History&nbsp;→ Automobiles - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1898519, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1087, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/XMbcMi9n-ec"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

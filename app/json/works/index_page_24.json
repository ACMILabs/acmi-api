Nineteen years old and on parole all he wants to do is get on with his life, away from the influence of his best friend Floyd &#8220;Pretty Boy&#8221; Davies. Doug wants to get a job, save some money and buy back his father&#8217;s property, Yetticup, the land of his people&#8217;s Dreaming. Floyd wants his old partner in crime to join him in &#8220;bigger and better things&#8221;.

Doug is half white and is torn between his love for Floyd and his family obligations. The pressures of friendship, family, identity and blackfella versus whitefella lifestyles, almost jeopardise Doug&#8217;s chances of achieving his dream. He goes back to his old ways, but unexpectedly the tables turn and it is Floyd who acts to save Doug&#8217;s dream, and give him hope for the future.

The film falls readily into two halves. The first details Jedda&#8217;s upbringing and her emotional turmoil as to her identity, which is solved by Jedda herself, when the call of her blood leads her into the physical and psychological world of her people.

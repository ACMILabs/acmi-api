The film illustrates the School&#8217;s emphasis on &#8220;Habits of Mind&#8221; (weighing evidence; awareness of multiple points of view; seeing connections and relationships; speculating on possibilities; and assessing values). Sequences illustrating the School&#8217;s approach to learning include: classroom activities in the humanities and sciences; family conferences; discussions of race, class, and gender; faculty meetings; disciplinary problems; sex education; conflict resolution by students; and student council meetings. The film shows the students learning how to learn, how to reason and how to critique complex issues requiring collaboration, personal responsibility and a tolerance for uncertainty.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Cinema verite", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community education", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Alternative schools", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - Study and teaching", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Education, Higher", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Students - Attitudes", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 884413, "name": "Frederick Wiseman", "creator_id": 80693, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 884412, "name": "Zipporah Films", "creator_id": 36103, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52691", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [34171]}, {"id": 96405, "acmi_id": "54619", "title": "High school geography: new insights", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "high-school-geography-new-insights", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This is a training film to show teachers how to use some parts of the High Schools Geography Project, particularly the &#8220;Geography in an urban age&#8221; unit.

With this bevy of comic actors, no single performance shines and the laughs abound.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Slapstick comedies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953622, "name": "Stanley Kramer", "creator_id": 67909, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953621, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953629, "name": "Peter Falk", "creator_id": 77822, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953628, "name": "Jimmy Durante", "creator_id": 77821, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953627, "name": "Buddy Hackett", "creator_id": 77820, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953626, "name": "Mickey Rooney", "creator_id": 77806, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953625, "name": "Milton Berle", "creator_id": 77819, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953624, "name": "Ethel Merman", "creator_id": 77818, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953623, "name": "Spencer Tracy", "creator_id": 74505, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 953620, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18127, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5S8VWhy4aE47MOTYqrFitTS5Jpw.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "It's a mad mad mad mad world (Stanley Kramer) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 823, "height": 1234, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41058", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [24569]}]}

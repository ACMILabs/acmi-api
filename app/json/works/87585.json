There were three things important to young Francie; his long suffering but mentally unstable mother, his alcoholic Da (Stephen Rea) - &#8220;the best music man that ever lived, and his best friend, Joe (Alan Boyle). Francie, clearly the leader in his friendship with blood brother Joe, centers the pair in a fantastic world removed from the reality of their everyday existence in a small Irish town. Set against the backdrop of the Cold War and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, Communism is as much a contributing factor to Francie&#8217;s cynicism towards the world as are aliens, and Mrs Nugent, mother of the young boy who threatens to be &#8220;better&#8221; friends with Joe. Inhabiting Francie&#8217;s fantasy world is Our Lady, controversially portrayed by Sinead O&#8217;Connor, who speaks to Francie in times of need. Francie and Joe live in a world influenced by popular culture and their rural environment. Thus, their days are marked by comics, flash bars, fishing, and American films. Francie&#8217;s questionable antics land him in a boys home, and the nature of these antics, as they are transferred stylistically into stagey cartoonish sets, render the scenes with a disturbing, puzzling and cruel aura. When Francie returns to the village he is outraged to find that a lot has changed. He begins a job assisting a local butcher who slaughters pigs, earning him the eponymous title, Butcher Boy. Pigs are a central theme throughout the film, and one which inspires the final disturbing scenes. Cast includes Stephen Rea, Fiona Shaw and Eamonn Owens (Francie).

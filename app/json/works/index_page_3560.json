When the clan&#8217;s elder son dies, the lord sends for Ichi to return - but the family refuse to be parted. Supported by Isaburo, for whom life has renewed meaning, father and son join forces against the warlord, who orders the couple to commit suicide and then when they refuse, sends soldiers to execute them. Set in 1725 Japan, &#8216;Rebellion&#8217; is an intriguing historical drama that pitches the samurai&#8217;s code of honour against his familial loyalties, reaching a typically bloody and beautifully choreographed finale.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Toshiro Mifune, Tomoyuki Tanaka ; director, Masaki Kobayashi ; writer, Shinobu Hashimoto ; photography, Kazuo Yamada ; music, Toru Takemitsu ; editing, Hisashi Sagara<br />\nCast: Toshiro Mifune, Takeshi Kato, Yoko Tsukasa, Tatsuya Nakadai, Tatsuyoshi Ebara, Michiko Otsuka.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:01:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Japan", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Japan - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Samurai - Conduct of life", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Samurai - Conduct of life", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social structure - Japan", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Japan", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Japan - History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889418, "name": "Masaki Kobayashi", "creator_id": 30311, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q445807", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816580, "name": "Tomoyuki Tanaka", "creator_id": 59283, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q652228", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1816579, "name": "Toshiro Mifune", "creator_id": 78585, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889415, "name": "Mifune Productions", "creator_id": 29627, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337466", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889414, "name": "Toho Kabushiki Kaisha", "creator_id": 22350, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146316", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [55170]}, {"id": 83334, "acmi_id": "304559", "title": "Johnson and friends. - Volume 3.", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "johnson-and-friends-volume-3", "creator_credit": "Ian Munro and Film Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Johnson, the fearless pink elephant, leads his friends in six new stories: The toys organise a surprise &#8220;Birthday party&#8221; for Johnson and must work together save their friend &#8220;Alfred&#8221; from being thrown away. &#8220;Battle of the bed&#8221;: the whole room and all the toys are at war.

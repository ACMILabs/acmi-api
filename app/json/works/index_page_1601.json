Spartans wanted a perfect society, a society where equality was enforced, male homosexuality made compulsory, money was outlawed, weak children, particularly boys, were disposed of (exterminated), and women enjoyed a social and sexual freedom unheard of in the ancient world.

Episode one: Explores the birth of the unique Spartan social system. Militaristic, communal and disciplined, the state enforced eugenics and euthanasia. Episode two: Focuses on the bitter rivalry with Athens and their startling different view of women. When war between the two states finally came, it raged for decades and split the ancient world.

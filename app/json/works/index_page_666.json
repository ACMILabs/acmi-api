films that chronicles the Australian cinema-going experience during WWI from 1914 to 1918.</p>\n<p>Between 1914 and 1918, cinema attendance was on the rise and the local film industry was expanding with over 50 Australian feature films produced during the period. While many of these films have been tragically lost, those that remain offer a rare glimpse into Australian life during this turbulent time.</p>\n<p>As the war began, filmmakers rushed to make features about Australia’s involvement. Alfred Rolfe’s &#8216;Hero of the Dardanelles&#8217; (1915) told the story of Gallipoli, complete with landing scenes shot at Tamarama Beach in Sydney.</p>\n<p>However, as the years progressed, war-weary audiences lost their taste for patriotic stories, and a new genre of home-grown comedies emerged featuring knockabout characters from the Australian bush.

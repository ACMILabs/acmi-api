Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia with an appreciation that only came from questioning his mortality. Episode four examines the 200 year history of cross cultural appropriation since Aborigines first made contact with white settlers, a period referred to as &#8220;after trousers&#8221;. Particular attention is paid to the plight of Aboriginals in Tasmania, from King Billy and Truganini to the claim by current residents of their Aboriginal ancestry.

This film is about the O-ga family who live in one of Tokyo&#8217;s immediate suburbs. It follows the family&#8217;s routine on a typical weekday including Mr O-ga motorbiking his way to the small factory where he is employed as a draftsman-technician. Like Mr O-ga, thousands of Japanese are heading for Tokyo and its environs, creating a massive commuter crush. At six o&#8217;clock, the work day ends. Mr O-ga returns to his modest home, the evening meal served Japanese-fashion at a low table, and television.

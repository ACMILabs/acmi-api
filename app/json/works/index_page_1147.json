Griffith&#8217;s 1915 feature film is reversed and re-edited into a 13-minute phantasm. LeVeque&#8217;s works have featured at the New York Video Festival, the Sundance Film Festival, the 2000 Whitney Biennial and the Pompidou Centre in Paris.</p>\n<p>In &#8216;4 Vertigo&#8217;, Hitchcock&#8217;s 128-minute feature film &#8216;Vertigo&#8217; has been processed anew by capturing one frame for every two seconds of the original movie. The condensed film was duplicated four times, shifting the horizontal or vertical orientation of the frame with each duplication so that the first image is right side up, the next is sideways, then upside down, then sideways, and finally right side up again. This is only evident when the video is examined frame by frame: played at normal speed the result is a stuttering kaleidoscopic engine that gives the viewer a nauseating yet thrilling sensation of physical and psychic<br />\nweightlessness. In LeVeque&#8217;s treatment the layered plot line and psychological depths of the Hitchcock original are overtaken by the patterns and rhythms of the new aesthetic centrifuge.</p>\n<p>LeVeque states: &#8216;Building on the notion of obsessive looking, I wanted to transform the original movie into a spinning mandala to generate a sensuous viewing where the dramatic narrative becomes unstable and elusive, a viewing experience where the hypnosis of cinematic spectacle is articulated to such a physical degree that it engenders a consciousness of watching.&#8217;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:08:52:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["PG", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2709779, "name": "Les LeVeque", "creator_id": 6805, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [NTSC]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "399", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [53521]}, {"id": 114027, "acmi_id": "B1001830", "title": "Beyond the screams: a US Latino hardcore punk documentary", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "beyond-the-screams-a-us-latino-hardcore-punk-documentary", "creator_credit": "Martin Sorrondeguy", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1999", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1999-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Martin Sorrondeguy, former vocalist for Los Crudos, is the producer of this powerful and uplifting documentary about the U.S. Latino punk scene and the DIY movement.

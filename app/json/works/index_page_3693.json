No one escapes Waters&#8217; skewered assault as he derides the mediocrity that now inhabits the American studio system. The plot is a compendium of Waters&#8217; previous film work and favorite obsessions, offering up kidnapping, demented ciniphiles, scathing parodies (the highlight being the Forest Gump sequel, &#8216;Gumped again&#8217;) and highly specific sexual perversity. Steven Dorf stars as Cecil B Demented, the deranged leader of the &#8216;Sprocket Holes&#8217;, a gang of film fanatics hell bent on overthrowing the Hollywood A-list and out to &#8220;punish bad cinema&#8221;.

Lead actress Kirsten Dunst emits trademark goofy, sexy charisma in the role of head cheerleader Torrance - a potentially odious character who, in the hands of Dunst, becomes actually likeable. At Rancho Carne High, Torrence&#8217;s squad defend their National Cheerleading Champion status from a rival all-black troop - the sassy routines of which the RCH crew have been pilfering for years. Further to an archetypal romance for Torrance (with &#8216;rebel&#8217; dark-haired new boy), the script ponders notions of homophobia among teens - although, by supporting gay stereotypes, at times seems to endorse the ideas it (mildly) seeks to critique. Audiences will either revel in the gloriously energetic vapidity of &#8220;Bring it on&#8221; - or run away cheering.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African American women", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African American women", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Class consciousness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ African American women", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage boys - Sexual behavior", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Homophobia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage boys", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage girls", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "History&nbsp;→ African American women", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Cheerleading"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915486, "name": "Beacon Pictures", "creator_id": 34039, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915487, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915488, "name": "Thomas Bliss", "creator_id": 80723, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915489, "name": "Marc Abraham", "creator_id": 79818, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915490, "name": "Peyton Reed", "creator_id": 30351, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 915485, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52175", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33794]}]}

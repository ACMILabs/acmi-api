The central image, appropriated from a popular TV commercial, is both riveting and ironic: A Duracell battery snaps together with a loud crack. This violent action, which is repeated over and over again, is intercut with flash-frame glimpses of the Nagasaki explosion, an American bomber pilot, aerial views of wartime destruction, victims of the nuclear bomb, and the artist&#8217;s face. Vom Bruch constructs a landscape of associations through mediated images, building relational discourse on the violence of war and capital.

When she realises that she has real talent in the ring, she finds a purpose and a drive in life that she never thought she had.

Eschewing conventional plotting by enfusing all the characters with ambiguity and complexity, &#8220;Girlfight&#8221; is a truly inspiring neo-feminist coming of age story. Both the female and male characters in the film are treated sensitively, and with a refreshing disavowal of the usual gender and racial stereotypes accorded to the representation of Hispanic Americans. The film won both the Directing and Grand Jury Prize at the 2000 Sundance Festival and there has also been international acclaim for Rodriguez whose feature film debut it is. The film also features a cameo appearance by independent filmmaker John Sayles who helped finance the film.

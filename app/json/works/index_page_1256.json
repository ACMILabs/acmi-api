filmmaker in and around Ballarat in Victoria. Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.

Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.

Jack developed an interest in film very early at cinema shows and gained his first film experience while serving in WWII, photographing wartime conditions and aircraft involved in the defence of Australia’s north, including the aftermath of the Darwin bombing raid.</p>\n<p>It was whilst working in photographic studios that Jack met his future wife, business partner and fellow film enthusiast Marie Bourke. Starting out by hiring films and showing them around regional Victoria, Jack and Marie established cinemas such as the Astor Cinema in Ararat, Bell Post Hill Drive-In in Geelong and the Southern and Northern Drive-Ins and Vegas 70 Cinema in Ballarat.  In the 1970s, the Anderson family acquired and restored the Regent Theatre in Ballarat which would then become the first multiplex in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Jack filmed his family and friends activities and outings, horse racing, Ballarat street scenes, motorcycle scrambling and travel scenes on the road – an unusual and wonderful look at life in regional Victoria during the 1940s to the 1960s.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film, we see the Anderson family on holidays, firstly with the kids at a horse riding school and then at a beach house, swimming, playing cricket and fishing.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:08:00 the kids learning to ride horses at a riding school<br />\n00:03:57:00 kids on the beach searching for crabs<br />\n00:04:10:00 a bucket of crabs<br />\n00:05:39:00 one of the boys on a paddle board<br />\n00:07:48:00 the girls playing cricket in the backyard<br />\n00:09:27:00 one of the boys dancing to a wireless on the patio<br />\n00:09:49:00 cooking steaks on a BBQ<br />\n00:11:28:00 the kids with a freshly caught fish<br />\n00:13:34:00 de-scaling and gutting the fish</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:15:08:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2110820, "name": "Jack Anderson", "creator_id": 43384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 119158, "acmi_id": "B2003548", "title": "[John Anderson Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "john-anderson-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Jack Anderson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, c. 1940s-1960s", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "7x 16mm film assorted newsreels and home movie.

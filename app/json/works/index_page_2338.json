The swarthy Armand (Nino Castenuovo) arrives in Rome and instantly falls for Marguerite, upsetting the &#8216;live for now&#8217; approach she has to love. They begin an affair that sees them run away to live on a yacht until Armand&#8217;s father intervenes trying to save his son&#8217;s money and reputation.

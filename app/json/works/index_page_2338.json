This ancient legend vividly portrays the hard life of the Saami people, their customs, many of which still exist today, and director Nils Gaup (Vanishing frontier, 1993 documentary) conveys the story in a simplistic, honest, and at times confronting way. A most compelling film. Cast also includes John Sigurd Kristensen, Helgi Skulason, Svein Scharffenberg, Inger Utsi, Nils Utsi, Anne-Marja Blind.

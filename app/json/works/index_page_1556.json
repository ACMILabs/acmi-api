The third story &#8220;Susanita&#8221; tells of the spinster landlady of a small apartment block in the neighbourhood who longs for romance in her rather sad and lonely life. Susanita (Margarita Sanz) unwittingly and tragically ends up in a &#8220;sham&#8221; marriage. &#8220;El Regreso&#8221; (The Return), the fourth story, ties up all the plot threads of romance, deceit, human frailty, sadness and despair into one final act. Based on the novel by Egyptian writer and Nobel prize winner, Naguib Mahfuz, and winner of 45 international film awards, including Berlin and Chicago, this is a fine film with an excellent supporting cast including Maria Rojo, Delia Casanova, Claudio Obregon, Juan Manuel Bernal.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Germany - Berlin - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - United States - Chicago - Awards", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mexico City (Mexico)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Neighbourhood", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Neighbourhood", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Poverty", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Prostitution", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Sociology, Urban", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Mexico", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug addiction", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Egyptian literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations", "Places&nbsp;→ Mexico City (Mexico)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/miracle-alley", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996610, "name": "Jorge Fons", "creator_id": 34476, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q612737", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996609, "name": "Alfredo Ripstein Jr", "creator_id": 34475, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2153025", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996608, "name": "Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografia", "creator_id": 34474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996607, "name": "Alameda Films", "creator_id": 34473, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50277", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 185, "name": "Mexico", "slug": "mexico"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [32264], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92769, "acmi_id": "316091", "title": "The Tree of wooden clogs = L'albero degli zoccoli", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-tree-of-wooden-clogs-lalbero-degli-zoccoli", "creator_credit": "Ermanno Olmi, GPC, Ital-Noleggio Cinematografico and Radiotelevisione Italiana", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1978", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Scenes from the lives of three peasant families, living in the same farmhouse in Lombardy at the end of the nineteenth century, are chronicled over the course of a year.

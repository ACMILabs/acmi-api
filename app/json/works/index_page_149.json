Being a Spike Lee joint, the film is also a wonderful celebration of music, both disco and punk, as well as a sophisticated examination of love and marriage, and bisexuality. Fast-paced, with excellent art design and a superb score, &#8220;Summer of Sam&#8221; emerges as a bittersweet love poem to the city of New York: its clubs and its porn theatres, its residents black and white, its uptown charms and its downtown sleaze. A contender for the most underrated film of recent times.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:16:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Berkowitz, David", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ United States - Race relations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Paranoia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Paranoia", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ New wave music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Punk rock music", "People&nbsp;→ Berkowitz, David", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/summer-of-sam", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959518, "name": "Touchstone", "creator_id": 22847, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959519, "name": "40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks", "creator_id": 25237, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959520, "name": "Jon Kilik", "creator_id": 68102, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959521, "name": "Spike Lee", "creator_id": 72793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51566", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959522, "name": "Spike Lee", "creator_id": 72793, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51566", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48059", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [30271], "external_references": [{"id": 1377, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1150713"}, {"id": 5519, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10279"}]}, {"id": 86123, "acmi_id": "307760", "title": "Summer interlude = Sommarlek", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "summer-interlude-sommarlek", "creator_credit": "Svensk Filmindustri and Ingmar Bergman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Sweden, 1951", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1951-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Summer interlude is Bergman&#8217;s poignant and lyrical study of young love.

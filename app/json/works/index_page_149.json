The action takes place in what appears to be an experiment in human survival as a select group of people wake up contained within the walls of a cube, twenty-six identical rooms wide and twenty-six high. How they got there is not made clear but finding their way out is the whole premise of the film. The skill-sets of this particular group of people aid or hinder their survival - for example, an old thief works out a way to find out if a room is booby-trapped or not - and survival is at stake because the cube kills and this is shown in scenes of visceral gore. The production design by Jasna Stefanovic, music by Mark Karven and some very believable special effects add to the tense but dreamlike sci-fi mood of the film. Human behaviour under stress provides the viewer with a gripping and edgy personal drama - even though &#8216;participants&#8217; have been de-humanised by being used like guinea pigs in a maze. Cast includes Nicole DeBoer, Nicky Guardagni, David Hewlett, Andrew Miller, Julian Richings, Wayne Robson and Maurice Dean Wint.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Imprisonment", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Murder", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Autism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Change (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Power (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychological tests", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology - Experiments", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Survival skills", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Mathematics"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/cube-1", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2000435, "name": "Vincenzo Natali", "creator_id": 37208, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q610764", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000434, "name": "Betty Orr", "creator_id": 81159, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000433, "name": "Mehra Meh", "creator_id": 81158, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000432, "name": "Cube Libre", "creator_id": 37205, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000431, "name": "Feature Film Project", "creator_id": 35329, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2000430, "name": "Trimark Pictures", "creator_id": 26486, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2000429, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53129", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [34573], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95066, "acmi_id": "319111", "title": "The Maids", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-maids-dvd", "creator_credit": "Christopher Miles, Robert Enders, Cinevision Ltee and Ely Landau Organization", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1974", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1974-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;American Film Theater = The American Film Theatre Collection&#8221;.<br />\nAdapted from French playwright, Jean Genet&#8217;s absurdist play, &#8220;The Maids&#8221; is about a pair of sisters caught up in a twisted play-acting game whereby their antipathy for their mistress and for each other, is revealed.

Based on the novel by Esther Freud (daughter of painter Lucien) and told from the perspective of the youngest daughter, Julia throws herself into the local culture and with barely the means to support her girls with food and shelter. She is match-made by the children to a street performer and dubious local Bilal (Said Taghmaoui) and they soon become a couple. Exotic and enticing, more a visual feast than a dramatic quest, the film may challenge viewers&#8217; notions of parenting, self-fulfilment and ultimately love. Some may just love the exotic travelogue nature that is the background of the Moroccan location. Soundtrack includes some memorable hits from the British charts of the 1960s/70s. The two performers in the roles of the daughters are captivating - eight year old Bea (Bella Riza) and six year old Lucy (Carrie Mullan) who are tired of mum&#8217;s adventures and just want to be &#8216;normal&#8217;.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows a group of holiday makers camping on Phillip Island in Victoria. Wallace shows several good close-ups of the koalas that are a feature of the island and one of the old kilns of the chicory industry of the past that are dotted over the landscape. There are also views of the bridge that was built in 1969 between San Remo on the mainland and Newhaven to replace the old wooden one, and many views of rolling, crashing waves on rocky coastline.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film, there is a gap of several seconds a few minutes in, beginning at 00:02:42:00 and ending at 00:02:58:00.</p>\n<p>00:00:02:00 views of the sea from

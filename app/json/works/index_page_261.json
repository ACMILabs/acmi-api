It&#8217;s all there from the howling wind, shutting doors, shadowy figures and things that go bump in the night to satanic rituals and mass murders and a good measure of blood and guts. It begins at a rural English estate at Headstone Manor where sometime before, a bloody massacre of eighteen people occurred, and ever since, the Manor has purported to be haunted by a satanic phenomena. Six scientists are sent to Headstone Manor to investigate and what follows is a parody of events building up to the planned killing of the scientists by the quite crazy &#8220;Sinister Man&#8221; (beautifully hammed up by Vincent Price), leader of the Satanic cult who inhabit the Manor. This is total spoof with lots of one-liners, soap-opera acting and a touch of Python humor - very British and quite entertaining. Stars well-known British TV comedian Kenny Everett as Dr Lukas Mandeville and Pamela Stephenson as Dr Barbara Coyle.

His secret lover, the Latino Gabriella (Jennifer Lopez), is a nanny at a rich Florida family home, which provides the necessary inside connection for Gates and his ruthless partner-in-crime, Victor Spansky, played to hammy effect by Michael Caine, to steal a set of expensive diamonds. Though the robbery goes according to plan, all hopes are quickly dashed when Gates gets into a domestic brawl just before leaving to cash in the jewels and his wife and step-son take off with the goods. What follows is a series of tragic events and complications as Spansky and Gates attempt to retrieve the jewels, and Gabriella becomes involved with Jason. Ultimately, the deceitful are punished and the good set free. &#8220;Blood and Wine&#8221; has all the elements of film noir - lust, deceit, revenge, greed, crime, and, most importantly, the desire to escape conventional constraints.

On the eve of his departure Gar reflects upon his past, on what might have been and upon his relationship with his emotionally distant father. His inner turmoil and rage are relayed via his alter ego (played by Des Cave) who gives a caustic running commentary about Gar&#8217;s shortcomings and those of his friends and family.

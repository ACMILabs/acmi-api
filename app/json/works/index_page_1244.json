Synge, both playwrights who shared the belief that plays could be about contemporary events and the reality of people&#8217;s lives. Contains excerpts from film adaptations and theatrical performances including &#8220;The Importance of being Ernest&#8221; (Wilde), &#8220;The Playboy of the western world&#8221; (Synge), &#8220;Juno and the paycock&#8221; (O&#8217;Casey), &#8220;Pygmalion&#8221; (Shaw), &#8220;The Plough and the stars&#8221; (O&#8217;Casey), &#8220;Mrs Warren&#8217;s profession&#8221; (Shaw) and interviews and conversations with actors and playwrights including Stephen Rea, Liam Neeson, Fiona Shaw, Alan Bennett, Tom Stoppard, Peter Gill, Edna O&#8217;Brien and David Hare. Also uses b&amp;w archival footage, stills, and beautiful images of the Irish landscape and seascape.

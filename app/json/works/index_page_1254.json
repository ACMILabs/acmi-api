Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film begins with Dorothy, Karen and Stuart relaxing around the family Christmas tree, 1984 and moves onto family activities in the backyard. There are two extended family weddings and some wonderful fashion from the early 1980s.</p>\n<p>The highlight of the film is Karen’s 21st birthday where we see the traditional table for the presents to be displayed before Karen proudly poses for the camera in front of her new car.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00 Dorothy, Karen and Stuart chatting, whilst seated around their

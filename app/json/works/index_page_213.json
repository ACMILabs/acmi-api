Erika presents a cool, detached aristocratic demeanor to her students and to the world.

When a handsome young music student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), attempts to seduce Erika, his forthright masculinity and her own masochistic desires create an untenable situation for the piano teacher.

This is a bleakly unsettling film which suggests that built into the very foundations of Western &#8220;high art&#8221; is an oppressive, vigilant surveillance and repression of excess and desire. Obviously, and not unsurprisingly with its Viennese setting, the film shares a deeply Freudian pessimism about the future of culture. This is not an easy film to watch and it contains extremely disturbing images of sexual self-abuse. It is nevertheless a consistent and unforgettable investigation of Western culture at a point of spiritual collapse. And the film is unimaginable without Huppert whose performance allows us to both understand individual suffering and the wider social and political analogies that Haneke wants to draw through her character.

The hyper-intelligent, mathematics guru, Jim Doyle, gets a job at the largest bank in the country, Centra Bank, after convincing the CEO, Simon O&#8217;Reilly, that he is one step away from cracking the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of economic theory - accurately predicting fluctuations in the stock market. Although the bank has closed multiple branches and slashed jobs, profits are still lagging and the Board demands results. For O&#8217;Reilly, Doyle is the answer to guaranteed ever-increasing profits and corporate expansion. His risk seems to have paid off when Doyle presents O&#8217;Reilly with a flawless formula that predicts an imminent stock market crash: the perfect opportunity for Centra Bank to gain extraordinary market control and power. Things take a dramatic, unexpected turn, however, when characters are revealed to be not what they seem. Doyle&#8217;s girlfriend, Michelle Roberts, is instrumental in uncovering the truth. Intercutting the scenes of corporate power and ruthlessness is the narrative of a pair of everyday &#8216;battlers&#8217; whose lives are irrevocably damaged by Centra Bank, and seek revenge.

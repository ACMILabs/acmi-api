At first disconsolate, the boy is cheered up by African-American handyman Uncle Remus (James Baskett), who tells him many delightful fables concerning the clever trickster Br&#8217;er Rabbit, whose adventures are illustrated in cartoon form. Based on the popular &#8216;Uncle Remus&#8217; stories of Joel Chandler Harris and blending live action with cell animation, &#8216;Song of the South&#8217; is an American classic, both loved for its popular songs and seamless technique, and reviled for its condescending depiction of African-Americans.

Filmed in a breathtaking nine minute long take, this initial scene becomes the frame around which &#8220;Code Unknown&#8221; interrogates the alienation and breakdown in social relations affecting the western world. From this initially confronting opening, the film becomes a sequence of scenes in which the traditional linear narrative structure of film is replaced with moments and fragments of disparate lives: the Romanian woman is deported back to her homeland only to begin again her attempt to illegally cross the border; the actress and the photographer passionately invest in their art and work meaning and purpose which is absent from their relationship; members of an immigrant Mali family attempt to negotiate the consequences on their culture and family of a move to France; a farmer is left alone on his farm as one by one his children refuse to carry on his work. Haneke&#8217;s films have often been accused of didactism and moralism (often by a defensive critical film culture which has abandoned political and metaphysical engagement for the laissez-faire aesthetics of denuded postmodernism), but as this film makes clear his commitment is to a critical and intellectually rigorous cinema which utilises modernist techniques to essay the state of contemporary social relations in Europe. His assured and daring mise-en-scene asks the viewer to &#8220;decipher&#8221; not only the film&#8217;s own structure but to also ask questions of what are the ethical and political codes now governing the cultures of the new post-Cold War capitalist world. &#8220;Code Unknown&#8221; suggest that this deciphering is difficult but crucial if we are to make sense of the dangers and tensions of a paradoxically multi-ethnic but highly socially segregated contemporary world.

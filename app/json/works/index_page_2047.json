Thai independent filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul used the technique to interview people throughout Thailand, learning a little bit about their lives and then asking them to contribute to the film&#8217;s evolving story. What emerges is at once a portrait of Thailand&#8217;s disenfranchised lower classes - farmers, fruit vendors, village performers of &#8220;mor lam&#8221; (a song-and-storytelling hybrid extremely popular in the rural northeast) - and a fractured group-narration of a story about a handicapped boy and his tutor, a woman named Dogfar. The finished story was then shot in dramatic form, using nonprofessional actors, and intercut with the earlier footage.

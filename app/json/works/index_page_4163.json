Woodrow Wilson leads the signing of the treaty of Versailles, and the League of Nations is instituted to protect the wellbeing of the world - disarmament being their number one priority. Hitler and Mussolini provide two prime examples of the treaty&#8217;s failure to live up to expectations. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1930: sporting fever&#8221;; sport reaches a new dimension as sporting success equates to national success. In the United States boxer Jack Dempsey competes in the highly publicised fight of the century, Babe Ruth excels at baseball, cricketers Jack Hobbs and Donald Bradman in cricket; the Bodyline series demonstrates that sport is as much about competing countries as it is about competing athletes. At the 1936 Berlin Olympics Hitler pushes the boundaries of sport, nationalism and propaganda. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1924: on the line&#8221;; Henry Ford&#8217;s mass production techniques take the world by storm, replacing skilled craftsmen with the assembly line. The increase in production lends well to the start of a consumer society in the twenties, but also leads to the necessity for trade unions as more and more people are exploited in the name of mass production. Narrated by Sean Barrett. &#8220;1927: great escape&#8221;; talkies arrive to counteract the popularity of the radio. Hollywood begins exporting American ideals and dreams to Europe, while countries like India, China and Japan find strength within their national industry. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks become Hollywood royalty and are emulated internationally while the Hayes Code of censorship enters the arena to satisfy church groups.

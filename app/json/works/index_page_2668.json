Both stories are set against an economic and social context in which black people were far from equal, emphasising the strength, determination and sheer power of women who live on their music. This compilation will appeal not only to those interested in blues and jazz, but is also a good example for cinema studies for it&#8217;s documentary, drama and animation style.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Women musicians", "Musicals", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 2117261, "name": "Museum of the Moving Image (BFI)", "creator_id": 77014, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44090", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [27111]}]}

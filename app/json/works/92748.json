There is an element of empathy and sympathy for Marlowe/Blake in this film and rather than being outrageously into the &#8220;horror&#8221; genre, it is presented in quite an evocative and almost surreal manner, even to the point where the transformation is shown in a subtle and gradual way by voice, facial and physical stature change. An understated film. Cast also includes Mike Raven, Richard Hurndall, George Merritt, Susan Jameson, Kenneth J.

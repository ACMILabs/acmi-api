The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke.</p>\n<p>This film, titled &#8216;Arnhem Land&#8217;, contains scenes from a trip to Arnhem Land and Katherine in the Northern Territory in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Travel is by jeep on dusty roads, boats and walking. Wallace captures the varied landscapes of rivers, rocky outcrops, hills, trees, flowers and the scrub as well as termite mounds. He also films buffalo, lizards and waterbirds. A highlight is the Aboriginal rock art drawings throughout the film.</p>\n<p>Originally made using Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:05:00 titles &#8216;WHC

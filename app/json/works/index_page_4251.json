He studied medicine in Melbourne, graduating in 1923. This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by his son, Graeme Fraser.</p>\n<p>This film is a compile of various home movies, some under-exposed black and white and some in colour.</p>\n<p>The films take place in several locations including suburban backyards and driveways, ski slopes, a farm and various unnamed beaches.</p>\n<p>We see children enjoying a family beach holiday, children playing in front of a seawall and one scene shot from above a beach that takes in many beachgoers and a lighthouse.</p>\n<p>Film consists of multiple examples of children playing in and around a suburban backyard in the 1930s. The children are seen playing with a variety of toys and riding tricycles and pedal cars, and occasionally tormenting the family dog.</p>\n<p>At one point the film takes us to Porepunkah, Victoria. We see competition between seemingly amateur ski jumpers and cross-country skiers on unnamed ski slopes. We also see women standing at a mountain lookout looking across at other mountains.</p>\n<p>The film contains scenes on farmland and scenes involving horses being ridden or fed. We see children dressed in school uniform riding horses in a small paddock and people riding horses on a beach track.</p>\n<p>We also see a sheep being sheared with manual shears.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by his son, Graeme Fraser.</p>\n<p>This film features children at play in Elwood, Victoria, in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>In the film we a see a young toddler playing in a well-maintained suburban garden. The toddler can be seen playing with a variety of garden sprinklers, with and without water, and various toys.</p>\n<p>A notable part sees a toddler riding a pony on the Elwood foreshore near Ormond Esplanade. The short glimpse we see of the houses in the background provides a fascinating, if very short, contrast to modern day Elwood.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm AGFA film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:56:00 toddler holding a metal cigarette case while watching a spinning sprinkler</p>\n<p>00:01:13:00 man holding a toddler while they play with his reading glasses</p>\n<p>00:01:58:00 dog jumping up trying to reach a teddy bear held by a child</p>\n<p>00:02:09:00 lady holding string attached to a pram while rolling it down a driveway towards the camera</p>\n<p>00:02:39:00 baby in yard with teddy bear</p>\n<p>00:05:54:00 baby playing with a sprinkler</p>\n<p>00:06:18:00 baby in a small tin bath</p>\n<p>00:07:45:00 baby eating in highchair</p>\n<p>00:08:24:00 baby playing with wooden clothes pegs</p>\n<p>00:09:19:00 baby wearing man’s hat in backyard</p>\n<p>00:10:03:00 baby playing with blocks, cards, and other toys on a rug in backyard</p>\n<p>00:10:37:00 infant being held while wrapped in a blanket</p>\n<p>00:11:01:00 toddler in backyard wearing a bag as a hat</p>\n<p>00:11:35:00 a lady pushing a pram through botanical gardens, perhaps Royal Melbourne Botanic Gardens</p>\n<p>00:12:25:00 baby in pram next to a pond with ducks</p>\n<p>00:15:53:00 toddler riding a pony on the Elwood foreshore</p>\n<p>00:17:22:00 infant on changing table</p>\n<p>00:17:51:00 infant in tin bath</p>\n<p>00:18:31:00 young girl playing with toy pram</p>\n<p>00:18:59:00 young girl pushing a toy pram containing a teddy bear</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:34:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Horses", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Ponies", "Places&nbsp;→ Royal Botanic Gardens (Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 984927, "name": "Stuart Fraser", "creator_id": 84853, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "179036", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1932-1933", "notes": "", "to_year": "1932-1933"}], "labels": [57731], "external_references": []}]}

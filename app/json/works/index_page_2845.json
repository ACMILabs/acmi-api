In April of 2021, when asked about Scott Morrison’s <a href=\"https://www.mamamia.com.au/brittany-higgins-scott-morrison/\">‘as a father’</a> response to rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins – which some believe he didn’t take seriously until <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/scott-morrison-criticised-for-invoking-his-daughters-in-response-to-brittany-higgins-rape-allegations/f749bed4-feb5-4903-9338-0d03b10d795f\">“viewing it from the lens of being a father of daughters”</a> – Tame responded: “It shouldn’t take children to have a conscience. And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience.” Like this most recent interaction with the Prime Minister, that clip also went viral on the internet, helping solidify Tame’s position as a courageous advocate for sexual assault survivors and a moral champion at a time when many see Australia’s leaders as lacking both courage and morals.</p>\n<p>As Imogen Champagne writes in <a href=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/01/27/grace-tame-side-eye-peter-van-onselen/\"><i>Crikey</i></a>:, &#8220;Conservatives have been trying to silence Grace Tame all year.

Broadly based on the life of Carol King, &#8221; Grace of My Heart&#8221; tells the story of Denise Waverly (Illeana Douglas), who starts her career as a want to be singer from Philadelphia, and goes on to become a successful songwriter. The story traces the long journey of personal discovery she must go through to ultimately become all that she wants to be. The film sets itself among the corridors of the famed Brill Building during the doo-wop heyday of the late fifties all the way through Malibu&#8217;s psychedelic surfer scene of the late sixties. With period costuming and a wall-to-wall pop soundtrack featuring the likes of Elvis Costello, Burt Bacharach, Lesley Gore, Carole Bayer Sager, J Mascis and Sonic Youth.

Though commonly portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant, Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. In 220, Cao Cao died in Luoyang due to an unknown illness. Legends contain explanations for the cause of his death, many of which suggest the involvement of Hua Tuo.<br />\nHua Tuo (died c. 208) was a renowned Chinese physician during the Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms Period. The Records of Three Kingdoms cites Hua as the first person in China to use anesthesia during surgery. He believed that for diseases that could not be treated with acupuncture and herbs, the only solution was surgery to remove the cause. It is well-documented that Hua Tuo frequently performed surgery on various parts of the body by using an herbal formula that he invented called Ma Fei San (Numbing and Boiling Powder) for systemic anesthesia. Hua Tuo refused employment offers from high-ranking officials on many accounts, including Cao Cao, and chose to practice medicine and serve the common people.<br />\nThere are various accounts of Hua Tuo&#8217;s relationship with Cao Cao, as well as the cause of Hua Tuo&#8217;s eventual execution. An alternate, and well-known, account notes that, eventually, Hua Tuo diagnosed Cao Cao&#8217;s headache to be so severe it could not be treated simply with herbs or acupuncture. The only cure would be to induce anesthesia and surgically open the head to remove the cause of the headache. Cao Cao was frightened and enraged by this proposition, since no such surgery had ever been performed before, he was convinced that Hua Tuo was making an attempt to assassinate him and sentenced the physician to death.</p>\n<p>Researcher&#8217;s Comments:<br />\nThe film&#8217;s account of the relationship between Hua Tuo and Cao Cao is one that is focused on the innate character differences between the two; both brilliant in their respective fields, highly idealistic, each with their own set of philosophies: Cao Cao&#8217;s sole ambition was to dominate and conquer others, while Hua Tuo believed in peace, universal rights and equality. There is continuous dialogue between the two men with regards to the notion of humanity, morality as well as the importance and inevitability of war. The contrast between the two men is well demonstrated in the narrative.<br />\n(3.5 stars - Mary Chen; May 22, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Politics and government", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine, Chinese", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Medicine, Experimental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Public health - China", "Foreign language films", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889921, "name": "Shanghai Film Studios", "creator_id": 21146, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889922, "name": "Zhumo Huang", "creator_id": 82525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889923, "name": "Yuan Tao", "creator_id": 82526, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889924, "name": "Fung Do", "creator_id": 82527, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889925, "name": "Rongshen Mao", "creator_id": 82528, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889926, "name": "Heng Xiao", "creator_id": 82529, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889927, "name": "Ganlong Zheng", "creator_id": 82530, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889928, "name": "Gong Xue", "creator_id": 82502, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889929, "name": "Zhumo Huang", "creator_id": 82525, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889930, "name": "Hongsheng Wang", "creator_id": 82425, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146428", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [55276], "external_references": []}, {"id": 79476, "acmi_id": "300426", "title": "HSC English: Essay Writing-Text", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hsc-english-essay-writing-text", "creator_credit": "Video Classroom", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1984", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>In this program, Geoff Shaw, HSC English teacher, provides a strategy for writing English essays on single literature texts.

Whatever the disasters in her lovelife, she compensates with a rich fantasy life in which she dreams of meeting a man who will take her away from the sleazy world of the dancehalls. Based on a stage musical scripted by Neil Simon, which in turn was based on Federico Fellini&#8217;s &#8220;Nights of Cabiria.&#8221; &#8220;Sweet Charity&#8221; is a highly enjoyable screen musical which points to the new direction the musical film was to take in the &#8216;70&#8217;s. Fosse maintains the Broadway plot but he choreographs a stunning series of dance routines around the songs &#8220;Big Spender&#8221;, &#8220;There&#8217;s Got to be Something Better than This&#8221;, &#8220;If My Friends Could See Me Now&#8221; and a wonderfully hippie version of &#8220;Rhythm of Life&#8221; sung by a New Age minister played by Sammy Davis Jr. In &#8220;Sweet Charity&#8221; Bob Fosse is beginning the experimentation with dance and music which was to lead to his groundbreaking work in &#8220;Cabaret.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953531, "name": "Bob Fosse", "creator_id": 4471, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953530, "name": "Robert Arthur", "creator_id": 77807, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953529, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 953528, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18107, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/2UUd14BiK7sNRakOqxGR1lr9xbQ.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Sweet Charity (Bob Fosse) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1225, "height": 1852, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41036", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1968", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1968"}], "labels": [24548]}, {"id": 73416, "acmi_id": "010486", "title": "Sweet are the fruits", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sweet-are-the-fruits", "creator_credit": "Jennie Blackwood and Zanthus Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1964", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Tells the story of the growing and harvesting of pears, apricots and peaches in the Ardmona District of Northern Victoria.

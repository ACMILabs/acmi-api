There are good closeups of the children, reflecting examples of children’s fashion and hairstyles of the era.</p>\n<p>We see the children venture out to the edge of the water and then play along the top of the seawall. There is great delight while eating ice cream from cones, and tears shed when an adult takes an uninvited taste.</p>\n<p>The second, third and fourth sections of the film show the children on a summer’s day in a backyard. Tricycles, a blow-up wading pool with the backyard hose leading into it, swings and a sand pit create a great snapshot of children’s recreation, toys, and equipment particular to the era. We also see a young boy kicking what appears to be an American shaped football and two boys playing with toy cars and a toy police car.</p>\n<p>The fifth section of the film shows a young baby being held by her mother.

We then see the baby lying in her pram and being closely inspected and entertained by her older sibling.</p>\n<p>We then go back to the beach with three very young children playing on the water’s edge with their mother beside them. Adults sit on the sand socialising, and there are scenes on the veranda of a holiday house. We see great examples of beach fashion, women&#8217;s hats, and children’s swimsuits.</p>\n<p>This film shows examples of Victoria in the summertime, beach, women’s fashion and children’s fashion, children’s swim wear, vintage toys and a perambulator, children’s leisure and recreation activities that reflect the time.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:18:00 Mother and three boys playing in the sand<br />\n00:02:25:00 Children filling buckets with sand<br />\n00:02:36:00 Two children filling buckets with sand<br />\n00:03:09:00 Young boy crawling along the sea wall<br />\n00:03:34:00 Eating ice creams from cones, offering to share with passers by<br />\n00:03:50:00 Close up of eating ice cream<br />\n00:06:25:00 Three children on their tricycles with backyard swing<br />\n00:06:56:00 Two boys swing on their backyard bench swing<br />\n00:07:03 :00 Three children on swing<br />\n00:07:24:00 Children playing in sandpit<br />\n00:08:36:00 Nice wide shot of children playing on swing and in the sandpit<br />\n00:09:52:00 Three children playing in blow up wading pool<br />\n00:10:17:00 Three children crowded on a backyard swing together<br />\n00:10:32:00 Children trying to move wading pool full of water across the grass<br />\n00:12:44:00 Boys play with toy police car in sand pit<br />\n00:14:08:00 Children play with what appears to be an American shaped football<br />\n00:15:32:00 Boy riding on vintage tricycle in front of house<br />\n00:17:13:00 Baby in vintage pram with sibling peering in and attempting to play<br />\n00:17:53:00 Mother and three very young children sit at the water’s edge<br />\n00:18:15:00 Very young child at water’s edge – good example of children&#8217;s swim wear<br />\n00:20:28:00 Family on veranda of holiday house with seascape in background<br />\n00:21:48:00 Three women sitting on the beach wearing great hats<br />\n00:22:51:00 Great family beach scene as above</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:23:32:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Beaches", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Playgrounds", "Places&nbsp;→ Victoria", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2051184, "name": "John Brookes", "creator_id": 86082, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "178595", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1950s-1960s", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1950s-1960s"}], "labels": [59198]}]}

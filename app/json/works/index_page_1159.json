Meanwhile, the sudden death of Jo&#8217;s wife leaves him free to marry his mistress, though he is promptly cut off from the family&#8217;s wealth; and Jo&#8217;s estranged daughter June becomes engaged to a bohemian young architect who threatens to bring a new strain of unpredictability to the family.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ English drama", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40039", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1967", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1967"}], "labels": [23590]}, {"id": 81049, "acmi_id": "325105", "title": "The Forsyte saga. - Vol. 01: Episodes 01-02", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-forsyte-saga-vol-01-episodes-01-02", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1967", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1967-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>As the story begins it is 1879, and talk in the opulent drawing rooms of London&#8217;s upper-middle class society revolves around the Forsytes.

This triggers best buddy James (Timothy Dalton) to relinquish his secret service status and licence to kill authority (Bond is under orders to complete another mission) as he embarks on a personal vendetta to revenge Sanchez&#8217;s brutality towards his friends. Ably assisted by ex-Army pilot Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell), Bond flies into Isthmus City to infiltrate himself into Sanchez&#8217;s posse where he discovers a television evangelist (Wayne Newton) providing a front for cocaine dealing. Featuring a plethora of water inspired stunts earlier on in the film, the cast also includes Benicio Del Toro as a brooding henchman and Talisa Soto as Lupe Lamore, Sanchez&#8217;s mistress, eye candy, and source of jealousy for Bouvier.

Her journey took her to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. She wanted to know why there was so much hatred towards America. Was it religious - Muslims against Christians - or were there other reasons for this apparent hatred? And yet for all the hatred and anger towards America, many Arabs expressed sympathy for the American people and made it clear that they did not condone terrorism or what occurred on September 11.

He studied medicine in Melbourne, graduating in 1923. This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by his son, Graeme Fraser.</p>\n<p>This film is a compile of various home movies, some under-exposed black and white and some in colour.</p>\n<p>The films take place in several locations including suburban backyards and driveways, ski slopes, a farm and various unnamed beaches.</p>\n<p>We see children enjoying a family beach holiday, children playing in front of a seawall and one scene shot from above a beach that takes in many beachgoers and a lighthouse.</p>\n<p>Film consists of multiple examples of children playing in and around a suburban backyard in the 1930s. The children are seen playing with a variety of toys and riding tricycles and pedal cars, and occasionally tormenting the family dog.</p>\n<p>At one point the film takes us to Porepunkah, Victoria. We see competition between seemingly amateur ski jumpers and cross-country skiers on unnamed ski slopes. We also see women standing at a mountain lookout looking across at other mountains.</p>\n<p>The film contains scenes on farmland and scenes involving horses being ridden or fed.

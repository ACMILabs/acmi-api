The only time Odette returns to her human form is when moonlight touches her wings, as soon as it disappears, wherever she is, her form returns to that of the swan. Assisted by her three new forest friends, Jean Bob (a frog), Speed (a turtle) and Puffin (a bird), Odette tries to overthrow the power of her captor while Derek tries to be reunited with his love and avoid the matchmaking efforts of his parents. Features the voices of Jack Palance, Howard McGillin, Michelle Nicastro, John Cleese and Steven Wright.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Musicals", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 252306, "name": "Richard Rich", "creator_id": 25341, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 252303, "name": "Swan Princess Partners", "creator_id": 35898, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51839", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [33489], "external_references": []}, {"id": 73410, "acmi_id": "010479", "title": "The Swallowtail story: the life history of an English butterfly", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-swallowtail-story-the-life-history-of-an-english-butterfly", "creator_credit": "Saffron Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Shows the English swallowtail butterfly in its British habitat, the extensive areas of reed beds round the Norfolk Broads in East Anglia, together with other wild life in the district.

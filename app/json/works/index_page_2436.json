Lan Yumeng was finally appointed the general director for the project and was together with Feng Lu. The project went well and Tian Geng felt that he had owed his family, colleagues and friends too much because of work.</p>\n<p>This is a very important film to understand China’s state-owned enterprise reform in the early 1980s. The film is based on the reform of the Sichuan Panzhihua Steel Company. It was the winner of the Best Film at the 12th Hundred Flowers Film Festival in 1989. Guangxi Film Studio was established in 1958, and some of the more well-known movies produced by the film studio include the Fifth Generation’s groundbreaking film, Yellow Earth (dir. Chen Kaige, 1985) and Not One Less (dir. Zhang Yimou, 1999). The film provides insights into the challenges of China’s state-owned enterprise reform in its early stage and has a positive tone. Now three decades after Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping launched the economic reform, Chinese society has undergone tremendous changes. Anyone interested in China’s state-owned enterprise reform may also want to watch Chinese independent filmmaker, Wang Bin’s Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks (2003), which presents another aspect of the state-owned enterprise reform.<br />\nThe leading actor of the film, Tang Guoqiang is very well-known in China. He has appeared in many films and TV series.

This incident happened during the Second Sino-Japanese War; at the time when the Chinese Civil War was (in theory) withheld and the Communists and Nationalists joined forces to fight against the Japanese.  The Wannan Incident was created by the hands of the Nationalist party leader Jiang Kai-Shek and the incident spurred indignation all over China.  While confronting the hype of anti-Japanese campaigns all over the country, Jiang Kai-Shek tries to suppress the Chinese Communists Party (CCP) and scholars with violence.  Guo Moruo, a scholar and a fugitive who rebelled against Jiang’s political ideologies returns to China to participate in the fight against the invasion of Japanese.</p>\n<p>Upon Guo’s return to China, he is angered by the corruption of the Nationalist Party’s Government rules and the disastrous state of the country.  His rage inspired him to create a historical theatre piece known as “Qu Yuan”. After Guo completed his creative piece, Zhou En the director of the Eighth Route Army subscriptions office, enthusiastically encourages and supports Guo’s production; emphasizing that revolution literary scholars like Guo can use their script writing talent as a weapon to attack their enemies.</p>\n<p>“Qu Yuan” finally proceeds on stage; and the show was a success across Chong Qing—spreading its fame throughout the whole of China. Subsequently, the fame of such a play which embedded controversial ideologies against the Nationalists ideals infuriated Jiang.  Jiang ordered Zhou En to force Guo to apologise and admit that they were wrong to produce such a play, but Zhou did not do as he was told.  Failing to force Guo, his supporters and the production to stop, Zhang Du, the advertising director of the Literary Cultural Conference tries to attack Guo’s moves by asking difficult questions.  A reporter asks whether Guo is a supporter of the Communist Party, Guo answers “Are all Buddhists monks in this world?” Guo replies all questions with ease and at ease, effectively using language, humour, wisdom and research to ‘dodge bullets’ fired at him by troublemakers at the conference.</p>\n<p>Guo attempts to break through the obstacles set for him and Chong Qing so that he can continue to preach his wisdom and political visions to other parts of China by moving Northward with his theatre production. On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, the theatre group set sail on a big ship, but police speedboats unexpectedly appear, making an attempt to stop them from leaving.  At once, theatre group troupes waved a flag vigorously in the air and dragon boats sailing next to their ship immediately turn their boats to face the police speedboats head-on.  As all dragon boats united to interfere with the police chase, it was an obvious picture that epitomize the strength of people power; the dragon boats are confronting police forces, and viewers can read that they are also working for what they believe is right—confronting corruption, injustice and power of the Nationalist Party.   While the dragon boats break the police chase, the theatre group is able to be on their way.  In the final scenes, Guo Moruo raises both hands into the heavens, showing his deep gratitude towards his Chinese comrades.<br />\n(Pearl Lau, 2013).</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>When will the day break? = Wen tian he shi ming = 問天何時明</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ma Erlu, Yabiao Wang, Wang Cheng, Beijing Film Studio, Qin Wei and Yue Yu</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1988</p>", "description": "<p>This film talks about China during the time in which the Wannan Incident (also known as the New Fourth Army Incident) occurred in the 1940s.

In June 1922, civil governor of Guangdong, Chen Jiongming attacked Sun Yat-sen’s residence and forced him to escape. Sun’s friend and assistant Liao Zhongkai was arrested. Although Chen released Liao due to pressure from different parties, Liao was on Chen’s hit list. Liao and his wife escaped to Shanghai to meet Sun Yat-sen with help from friends.<br />\nThe 1920s was a time that China’s Qing dynasty had been overthrown and warlords and different political parties were all competing for power. Liao supported Sun’s initiative of reforming the KMT by recruiting Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. Liao went to Japan on behalf of Sun to meet Russian Communist representatives, which laid a foundation for Sun’s policy. In 1923, Sun retook Guangzhou (capital of Guangdong province) and appointed Chen to be financier of the KMT and governor of Guangdong. Liao had to fight with the Rightists in KMT, who were against the KMT-CCP cooperation.<br />\nLiao lost the battle to the Rightists and was forced to resign. 1924 witnessed riots in Guangzhou again, but Liao led his force and repressed it. In 1925, Sun died in Beijing and Liao decided to uphold Sun’s policy. Liao’s pro-Communist political stance irritated the KMT Rightists who plotted a murder again him on 20 August 1925.

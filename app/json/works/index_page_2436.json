These sentiments weigh heavily on Private Doll, facing the horrors of war for the first time. Having left behind his wife of just eight days, Doll is determined to do whatever it is required to stay alive and to maintain his sanity. As he battles Japanese soldiers however, he is also engaged in a battle with one of his own, a sadistic and tough Sergeant (Jack Warden), who is starkly contrasted to the thoughtful Doll. This explosive dramatization of the American assault on Guadalcanal in World War 2 is a thoughtful study on the effects of war on innocent and not so innocent minds, and the apparent meaninglessness of it all. Cast includes Keir Dullea and Jack Warden. Based on the novel by James Jones.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Campaigns - Solomon Islands - Guadalcanal", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sadism", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2270980, "name": "Andrew Marton", "creator_id": 25045, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q506183", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2270975, "name": "Sidney Harmon", "creator_id": 24735, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4420074", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2270971, "name": "Ace Films", "creator_id": 15873, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315078", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2270965, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44347", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1964", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1964"}], "labels": [27282]}, {"id": 87791, "acmi_id": "309874", "title": "Kids (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kids-d", "creator_credit": "Larry Clark, Cary Woods, Gus Van Sant, Leigh Blake, Michael Chambers, Patrick Panzarella, Excalibur Films, Independent Pictures and Miramax Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 45635, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q646426"}], "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;Kids&#8217; is a shocking movie representing an underground youth culture of excess and liberty to the extreme in an inner-city urban habitat.

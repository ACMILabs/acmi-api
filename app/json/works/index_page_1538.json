A man known for his professional objectivity and honesty, Fowler&#8217;s personal life is a fiasco. Involved with a local woman, Phuong, whom he loves, Fowler is married to a strictly religious woman back in England who refuses to divorce him. Into their lives steps an enigmatic American man who hopes to rally the people of Indochina to become a third force and challenge the factions that seek to over-determine their lives. The American man falls for Phuong, and asks only that Phuong be given the opportunity to choose between the men and (like Indochina), resolve her destiny. In danger of losing Phuong to the American, Fowler is drawn into a suspicious and venomous state, convinced that the American is supplying explosives to non-Communist troops. &#8220;The Quiet American&#8221; leaves the more contentious political elements of Graham Greene&#8217;s novel to languish in favour of highlighting the personal grief of a middle-aged man in crisis.

Despite the misgivings of his colleagues, Frankenstein perseveres with this plan, even when it entails killing off his curious fiancee. Conveniently, when a car crashes nearby and several teenagers die, Frankenstein eagerly steals a body thrown clear. From these methods then Professor Frankenstein assembles his creation - who turns out to be a monstrous variation of a man, with a perfect body but a mangled face and deranged mind. Feared and loathed, the monster starts to kill and maraud the innocent, until he turns on his creator. Notwithstanding the low production values and ham acting, this curious film holds a certain appeal as a display of 50s attitudes and paranoia, mixed with B-grade horror movie tropes. Cast includes: Phyllis Coates, Gary Conway, Robert Burton and George Lynn.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Scientists"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998365, "name": "Herbert L.

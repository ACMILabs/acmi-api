Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff are friends, both bachelors operating in English society hoping to find love in a proper match. Each man has spun lies about a fake identity in order to achieve romance with Gwendolyn Fairfax and Cecily Cardew, respectively. When the two couples meet up at Cecily&#8217;s place of residence, their lies unfurl and the true selves of both are revealed. Wilde&#8217;s last play is a satire on English society and manners, wonderfully sending up the portentousness and pomposity of the upper classes. Two particularly memorable characters are the boorish snob Lady Bracknell and the dithering governess Miss Prism (the latter played with import here by Margaret Rutherford).

Not only does the film deal with issues of segregation and integration and the emergence of black pride and black consciousness, but most critically, it describes the return to Africa of black American visitors. At the centre of the film is Ali, who, both as athlete and entertainer, persona and man, is a compelling figure, deeply committed to issues of racial, religious and political justice. The film also features insights and commentary from Norman Mailer, George Plimpton, and Spike Lee.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Biographical", "Closed captioning", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Africa, North - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Foreman, George", "People&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Foreman, George"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/when-we-were-kings", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998527, "name": "Taylor Hackford", "creator_id": 18255, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q545573", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998526, "name": "Leon Gast", "creator_id": 65155, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998525, "name": "David Sonenberg", "creator_id": 80519, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998524, "name": "Leon Gast", "creator_id": 65155, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998523, "name": "Taylor Hackford", "creator_id": 18255, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q545573", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998522, "name": "DAS Films", "creator_id": 27769, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998521, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51640", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [33357], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93848, "acmi_id": "317536", "title": "Mousehunt", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mousehunt-dvd", "creator_credit": "Gore Verbinski, Bruce Cohen, Tony Ludwig, Alan Richie and NBCUniversal", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>When their elderly father dies, two brothers inherit the family business - the Smuntz string factory - along with a dilapidated house.

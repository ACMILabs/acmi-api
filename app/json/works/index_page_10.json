We can already see signs of its dystopian world around us. Surveillance by governments and corporations reflects today’s data tracking and social media monitoring. In cyberpunk, big corporations have huge power, like how tech giants like Google and Amazon influence politics and our privacy. Cybernetic upgrades, once just sci-fi, are becoming real with high-tech prosthetics and brain implants. Virtual reality and the metaverse create digital worlds first imagined in cyberpunk. Hacktivism, central to the genre, is mirrored in movements like Anonymous and WikiLeaks. The rundown cities and inequality in cyberpunk reflect real problems, such as economic gaps and gentrification.</p>\n<p>The emergence of cyberpunk<br />\nIn the 1980s, cyberpunk grew from the New Wave science fiction movement of the 1960s and 70s. Writers like Philip K. Dick (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, 1968) and JG Ballard (High-Rise, 1975) looked at how technology can create feelings of alienation and urban decay. Unlike earlier sci-fi writers, who imagined a hopeful 1950s-style future, the pioneers of cyberpunk warned of the darker side of technological progress. William Gibson’s novel Neuromancer (1984), Katsuhiro Otomo’s manga Akira (1982–90) and Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982) all appeared around the same time in the early 80s. They reflected worries about the rapid growth of technology and corporate power. As personal computers became common and networks evolved into the early internet, concerns over privacy, surveillance, and the influence of large companies also grew.</p>\n<p>The genre’s dark settings symbolised the 1980s. Technologically advanced but unequal cities mixed the style of Japan&#8217;s booming tech industry and America’s growing inequality. Cyberpunk combined this with a rebellious spirit drawn from 1970s punk and hacker culture, focusing on themes of marginalisation and resistance.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>RESET: A Journey into Cyberpunk</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "", "description": "<p>Björk imagines a world that balances technology and nature; cyberpunk confronts technology’s darker side.

Now they stand as launchpads for the future, not beasts of destruction but beings of light and memory.” – Natasha Wanganeen</p>\n<p>After the End was filmed and takes place on Ngarrindjeri, Narungga, Kaurna and Noongar woman Natasha Wanganeen’s Country in South Australia. This includes the Yorke Peninsula, and surrounding areas, encompassing the Olympic Dam mine, the Cooper Basin, and the Maralinga / Woomera nuclear test sites. The Olympic Dam mine is the largest single deposit of uranium in the world, and the fourth largest copper deposit; the Cooper Basin has Australia’s most important oil and gas deposits; and the UK conducted seven nuclear tests at Maralinga / Woomera from 1956 to 1963. This colonial and environmental destruction is referenced in After the End, with Wanganeen’s poetic narrative and Young’s visuals envisioning First Peoples reclaiming Country and the infrastructure of extraction.</p>\n<p>While cyberpunk explores virtual subcultures and solarpunk imagines positive environmental communities, After the End represents a new style – ‘Planetary Punk’, which adapts global infrastructure to create post-colonial climate solutions.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>After the End</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Liam Young and Natasha Wanganeen</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia and United States, 2024</p>", "description": "<p>As the world comes together to end fossil fuels these massive remnants of industry sit like scars on the earth.

Ray is the father who drinks, Liz the mother, Jason the brother. There are some animals and the brother kills flies. The older brother films them with his handycam - intently observing whatever is going on.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Richard Billingham&#8217;s &#8216;Ray&#8217;s a Laugh&#8217; was hailed as the photo book of the decade. His photographs were one of the talking points of &#8216;Sensation&#8217;. Billingham has now made &#8216;Fishtank&#8217;, a commission for television by Artangel in collaboration with film-maker Adam Curtis and Illuminations TV for BBC2&#8217;s acclaimed TV series. The &#8216;video verite&#8217; of Fishtank is contained within the compressed space/fishtank of the flat. Sometimes they talk, sometimes they argue. Billingham&#8217;s film registers the emotional temperature of this space and the family who live there with a closeness that transcends camera conventions. Like the paintings of Lucian Freud, Billingham crafts a terrible beauty from the landscape of family life and its patterns of pathos, despair and hope.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:46:43:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["MA", "Mediatheque - not for children (ACMI classified)", "unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Artwork"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 2}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2628602, "name": "Richard Billingham", "creator_id": 6473, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7324163", "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2628603, "name": "Gerrie van Noord", "creator_id": 81856, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "commissioning agent", "role_id": 485, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "SP Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "142", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [53505]}, {"id": 114010, "acmi_id": "B1000119", "title": "Mapping a city of fragments v.2", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "mapping-a-city-of-fragments-v2", "creator_credit": "Chip Lord", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, black and white and colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Using the opening of Godard&#8217;s film &#8216;Alphaville&#8217; as a foundation, Lord constructs a vision of the evolving global city during the last years of the 20th Century.

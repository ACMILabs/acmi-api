The glowing report that ensues takes the viewer on a tour of the city&#8217;s significant sites, its relaxed shopping districts and new suburban homes, offering a snapshot of Canberra at a time when its population was just 40,000 strong. With its planned transport network, new schools, established retailers and infant café culture, Canberra is depicted as a modern and prosperous city, all the more appealing for the sense of balance afforded by its graceful bushland setting. Whether you view our nation&#8217;s capital with affection, indifference or antipathy, this upbeat film leaves little room for doubt that Canberra is unlike any other city in Australia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:16:17:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canberra (A.C.T.)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Canberra (A.C.T.) - Description and travel", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ City planning", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ City planning - Australia", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ City planning - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ City planning - Social aspects", "History&nbsp;→ Canberra (A.C.T.) - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Canberra (A.C.T.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia", "Travelogue"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1187929, "name": "Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "creator_id": 11967, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1187930, "name": "Colin Dean", "creator_id": 12548, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1166, "name": "External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42cw_9Fyvqw"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "159341", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1958", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1958"}], "labels": [57813]}]}

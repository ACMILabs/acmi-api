Morgan Freeman is Detective Somerset, a police officer who has seen too much crime and has witnessed for too long the savagery of a decaying urban world. Brad Pitt is young Detective Mills, eager to prove his abilities and excited to have landed a fascinating if gruesome case. &#8216;Seven&#8217; is a film that betrays an almost misanthropic contempt for the contemporary world; a world in which spirituality is infused with vengeance and where relationships are tainted by exploitation. The nameless city is always dark and wet, and begins to resemble a vision of Hell. &#8216;Seven&#8217; includes stunning photography, electrifying editing and a meticulous soundtrack. The film confronts the viewer with the hateful extremities of evil. It remains unforgettable because it also suggests that evil is not the prerogative of monsters. Cast includes Gwyneth Paltrow and a diabolically good Kevin Spacey.

In Chinese mythology the Eight Immortals are believed to know the secrets of nature. They represent separately male, female, the old, the young, the rich, the noble, the poor, and the humble peasant. Each Immortal’s power can be transferred to a tool of power, kind of a talisman associated with a certain meaning that can give life or destroy evil. In modern China, the Eight Immortals are still a popular theme in artwork. Their figures, in the form of pottery, paintings, and other artworks, remain ubiquitous amongst households across China.<br />\nThe Immortals are:<br />\nHe Xian Gu (The Immortal Woman): The daughter of a 7th-century shopkeeper, she accidentally ate a magic peach and became immortal. She is attributed by the lotus/lotus pond, which can cultivate people through meditation.<br />\nCao Gou Jiu (The Royal Uncle Cao): Cao Gou Jiu is reputed to have been the brother of a 10th century Song Empress. He is attributed with a jade tablet which can purify the air. He is the patron deity of actors.<br />\nLi Tie Guai (Iron-Clutch Li): Skilled at magic he was able to free his soul from his body and aid and meet others in the celestial realm. He is represented as a lame beggar carrying a double gourd.

His attribute, the sword, which can subdue evil, allowed him to travel the earth defeating evil.<br />\nHan Xiang Zi (The Philosopher): Han Xiang Zi is said to have been the nephew of Han Yü, a famous scholar of the 9th century. Among his special skills was the ability to make flowers bloom instantaneously and tame wild beasts.<br />\nZhang Guo Lao (The Elder Zhang Guo): Zhang Guo Lao is reputed to have been a recluse of the 7th or 8th century.

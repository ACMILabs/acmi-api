So impressed are the soldiers by the this gesture, they decide to not destroy the town, nor tax the inhabitants and instead return year after year continuing their association with the women who live there. The lavish sets and costumes entertainingly evoke the bucolic life of 17th century Flanders, in a successful attempt to deliver, writ-large, the poetic setting of a Flemish masterpiece. A sharp amusing script has made this film a continuous favourite with audiences. Controversially, the film was banned in Germany, suspected of parodying the rising Nazi army.

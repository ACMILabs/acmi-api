Narrated by Robyn Williams, the series consists of archival footage, first person narratives and interviews with experts. &#8220;1800-1906: A Thirst for blood &amp; iron&#8221;: Henry VIII instigates two centuries of a British maritime dynasty. Years later, iron clad warships provide the basis of America&#8217;s naval power. The United German Republic also features during this period with Japan joining them as a naval super power. &#8220;1906-1916: Clash of the Dreadnoughts&#8221;: In 1906 Britain upset the global balance of power by constructing the big gun battleship HMS Dreadnought - instigating an arms race that led to the largest confrontation in naval history.

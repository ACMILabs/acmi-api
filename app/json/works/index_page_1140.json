Photographed in glowing primary colours, with some scenes shot in slight slow-motion, this study of male erotic obsession is a lazy, dreamy film about nothing more than a state of being - happiness. Cocooned in their little one-roomed store, Antoine and Mathilde, his luminous wife are sufficient to themselves. Two wonderful performances from Jean Rochefort and Anna Galiena are complemented by the Arab music Antoine loves and original music by Michael Nyman.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:21:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951913, "name": "Lambart Productions", "creator_id": 25950, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951914, "name": "TFI", "creator_id": 25890, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951915, "name": "Patrice Leconte", "creator_id": 25951, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951912, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39749", "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [23310]}, {"id": 75787, "acmi_id": "013395", "title": "The Hague - Holland", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-hague-holland", "creator_credit": "Carrilon Films, Holland, Hans Vos and Caspar Willers", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Netherlands, 1971", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>The capital of the Netherlands is a felicitous mixture of the old and the new.

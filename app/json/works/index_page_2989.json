This was a war of attrition of men, machines and ideals. The futility of losing a generation of 9 million men who never came home, from a war many didn&#8217;t understand. National honour, fervour, and man&#8217;s greed to expand borders and dominate others led to a society which was torn asunder and would never be the same again. It affected and influenced art, music, literature and changed the history for the rest of the 20th Century.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:20:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Versailles (France)", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War - Environmental aspects", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War and society", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War memorials", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Participation, Australian", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Peace", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ War - Environmental aspects", "History&nbsp;→ World War, 1914-1918 - Participation, Australian", "History&nbsp;→ World history - 20th century", "Places&nbsp;→ Versailles (France)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2064041, "name": "Margaret Koval", "creator_id": 28779, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079484", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064032, "name": "BBC-TV", "creator_id": 11912, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064036, "name": "Imperial War Museum (Great Britain)", "creator_id": 28778, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315322", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2064029, "name": "KCET (Television station : Los Angeles, Calif.)", "creator_id": 17999, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2064025, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

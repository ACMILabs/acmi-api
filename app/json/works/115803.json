When Xiao Liu mentions his relationship with Qinmei, Baoqing gives him his approval. Later that evening, Xiulian tells her father that Qinmei has yet not returned home.

When Baoqing heads out to assess the damage, he finds the tearoom completely obliterated. Baoqing receives a visit from a military adjutant on behalf of Wang, a 55-year-old ex-commander. Commander Wang has expressed an interest in Baoqing&#8217;s daughter Xiulian. Sensing Baoqing&#8217;s disapproval, he tries to appeal to him with the allure of Commander Wang&#8217;s enourmous fortune, but Baoqing insists that people cannot be bought or sold as concubines. They contemplate running away, but are afraid that Commander Wang&#8217;s power and influence will catch up with them. They decide to visit Commander Wang with Xiulian, so that he can see she is only a child. When they arrive at the Wang residence, they are greeted by his ill-mannered wife, who tells Xiulian that she has brought the situation upon herself by flirting with Commander Wang.</p>\n<p>Feng, Baoqing&#8217;s other daughter, marries Commander Wang&#8217;s adjutant Tao. Upon hearing the news, Commander Wang berates Tao for finding himself a wife for himself while he remains without a concubine. One day, when Tao is out, Commander Wang rapes Feng. Tao leaves her.</p>\n<p>Baoqing meets with Xiao Liu, who tells him that he cannot stay with Qinmei if she continues to prostitute herself. Instead, he expresses an interest in marrying Feng, convincing Baoqing that their union will stabilise the family. Both Feng and Xiao Liu have been wronged in their relationships and therefore suit each other.</p>\n<p>Baoqing expresses concern about Xiulian&#8217;s future. He sends her to school, but she is immediately teased for not being able to read, leaving in tears. He tells his daughter, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t belittle yourself, people won&#8217;t look down on you&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Xiulian starts seeing Li Yuan, a local man, but when he is later arrested for stealing $50 000, Baoqing worries that she will bring shame upon the family.</p>\n<p>Xiulian is scared of thunder, most likely due to the air raids. One night, when she is home alone during a storm, Li Yuan visits her in her vulnerable state with the pretense of protection, but ends up raping her.

Details of the construction of castles are used to explain the purposes served by the more important parts of the castle such as the moat, the drawbridge, the courtyard, stables for horses, wells for water, the big tower or donjon and the thick outer and inner walls. Tapestries in castles show scenes depicting hunting, chivalry, knights and nobles. The function of the church and the responsibility of abbots and bishops in caring for the land are explained. Models and sketches illustrate the organization of the feudal manor and show how traces of the feudal system are still to be found in Modern France.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["History&nbsp;→ Castles - History", "History&nbsp;→ Feudalism - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ France - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 747758, "name": "Coronet Instructional Films", "creator_id": 12005, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "25885", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1950", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1950"}], "labels": [9717]}, {"id": 91122, "acmi_id": "314204", "title": "The Meadow ant", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-meadow-ant", "creator_credit": "CB Instructional Ltd", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>Explains where the meadow ants are found, and traces the lifecycle of the meadow ant: the nest-making, feeding, and mating.

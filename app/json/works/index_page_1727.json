Sinclair&#8217;s debut feature is based on a &#8216;micro series&#8217; of 4 minute episodes he made for New Zealand television that followed events in the lives of a group of friends living in Auckland, and is similarly structured as a series of loosely connected episodes. Liz (Danielle Cormack) is disturbed to find that she is pregnant and potentially facing motherhood as a single mother. Her horny and geekish boyfriend (Joel Tobeck), is refusing to deal with the impending return of his other girlfriend from overseas. Prue (Willa O&#8217;Neill), Liz&#8217;s best friend, is having traumas of her own as she deals with the joys of her forthcoming marriage to Niue-born Mike (Shimpal Lelisi).

However, Claude&#8217;s world is starting to change; Claude realises that she has developed stronger feelings for Ellen. Ellen is spending less time with Claude because she has a new boyfriend, Mark, whose aggression and homophobia alienate Claude. Luke (Pat Briggs), a gay musician, has moved into her apartment block and encourages Claude&#8217;s interest in music and the world she lives in. When Claude meets Lucy (Leisha Hailey from The Murmers), her recognition of her homosexuality comes to the fore. However, Claude&#8217;s world and the people in it are careering out of control; violence abounds and Claude witnesses Ellen&#8217;s increasingly complex relationship with drugs. The Sichel sisters, Alex (director) and Sylvia (writer) have created a rites-of-passage film about coming out and growing up in the unforgiving environment of Hell&#8217;s Kitchen. The desultory mood of the film and the subtle performance of Folland as Claude launches a dramatic debut feature for the Sichel sisters.

Director Paul McGuigan&#8217;s violent fable follows the young Gangster&#8217;s initiation into London&#8217;s glamourous crime scene of the sixties, after he is hand picked by the suave and sinister crime boss Freddie Mays (David Thewlis). Gangster&#8217;s violent disposition quickly escalates him to the inner circle of Freddie&#8217;s crime syndicate, while the impressionable Gangster begins to develop a strong infatuation for Freddie and his opulent lifestyle. The obsession takes a dangerous turn however when Freddie meets night club singer Karen (Saffron Burrows), leaving the jealous Gangster fuming and thirsty for revenge. McGuigan&#8217;s flashy visual style fetishizes this motley crew of gangsters, at times filming them in slow motion, bathing them in lush colours and filtering their violence through fractured lenses.

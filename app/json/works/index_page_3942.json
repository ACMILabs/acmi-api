Born in Beirut in 1967, Soha speaks candidly and openly about her life and experiences living and growing up under Israeli occupation, of joining the Lebanese National Resistance Movement (Jabhat al Muquawama al Watanieh Lubnaniya) in 1986, of her capture by the Israelis in 1988 and her forced detention for the next ten years in the Khiam detention centre in South Lebanon until her eventual release on September 3, 1998. Reflective about the past, Soha&#8217;s thoughts however are with the future and maintaining a strong commitment to carrying on the &#8220;political, economical, social and cultural struggle&#8221; for the ones who still remain in the detention centre and for the liberation of Lebanon from Israeli occupation. The interview solely takes place in Soha&#8217;s Paris room one year after her release. A poignant and sensitive film enhanced by the intimacy and interaction between filmmaker and subject.

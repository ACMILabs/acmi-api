Starting out with Ray Charles and featuring clips and photographs of musicians of the last century, Eastwood&#8217;s journey is sure to inspire a new generation as he asks &#8220;Who were your influences&#8230;?&#8221; Whilst guitar seems to take centre stage in modern blues, it could be argued that it was piano that lead to the popularisation of the form with hit makers such as Ray Charles, Fats Domino and Duke Ellington leading the way. Refreshingly includes some footage and interviews with female musicians. Some of the legends seen performing are: Ray Charles, Dr. John, Fats Domino, Prof. Longhair, Nat King Cole, Dave Brubeck, Marcia Ball, Jay McShann, Art Tatum, Big Joe Turner and Duke Ellington among many others.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Eastwood, Clint, 1930-", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Charles, Ray, 1930-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composition (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music appreciation", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Piano", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Women musicians", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Charles, Ray, 1930-", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Eastwood, Clint, 1930-", "People&nbsp;→ Pianists - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1675868, "name": "Clint Eastwood", "creator_id": 72253, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1675867, "name": "Alex Gibney", "creator_id": 25019, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1675866, "name": "Margaret Bodde", "creator_id": 81252, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1675865, "name": "Reverse Angle International", "creator_id": 37389, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1675864, "name": "Vulcan (US)", "creator_id": 37388, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1675863, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD;

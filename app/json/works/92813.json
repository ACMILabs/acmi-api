This video provides a wonderful insight into the operations of NASA, the rigorous training of the American astronauts (the first seven being Donald Slayton, Alan Shepard, Walter Schirra, Virgil Grissom, John Glenn, Leroy Cooper and Malcolm Scott Carpenter), the designing and trialling of the various rockets and space ships, the many failed launches as well as the successful and newsbreaking missions, and the continuing development and commitment to achieve what at times seemed to be unachievable - man&#8217;s conquest of space and the desire to explore the unknown.

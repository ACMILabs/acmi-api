The charming and enchanting Gene Kelly is honoured in this tribute hosted by Shirley Maclaine. Through many film excerpts of his cinematic career, including For Me and My Gal (1942), An American in Paris (1951), Take Me Out to the Ballgame (1949), Cover Girl (1944), Singin&#8217; in the Rain (1952) we see the wonderful genius and style of this multi-talented dancer, director, actor, and choreographer. Take a walk down memory lane as a number of Hollywood stars including Fred Astaire, James Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O&#8217;Connor, Cyd Charisse, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Leslie Caron and Olivia Newton-John celebrate Gene Kelly&#8217;s accomplishments with their own personal stories and reminiscings.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Kelly, Gene, 1912-1996", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - Study and teaching", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Archival resources", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Study and teaching", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - United States - History", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - Study and teaching", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Study and teaching", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music and dance", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tap dancing", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ Kelly, Gene, 1912-1996", "People&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses - Biography"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2327138, "name": "Don Mischer", "creator_id": 21955, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2327137, "name": "George Stevens", "creator_id": 22751, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51490", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2327135, "name": "American Film Institute", "creator_id": 10422, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2327141, "name": "Fred Astaire", "creator_id": 76474, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "anchor/host", "role_id": 629, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2327130, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53383", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [34825], "external_references": []}, {"id": 78317, "acmi_id": "016910", "title": "The Ambassadors symphony", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-ambassadors-symphony", "creator_credit": "Martin Cohen and Brian Morris", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1984", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1984-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Provides a non-narrated overview of the 1984 Australian Youth Orchestra tour in Europe.

The film, therefore, advocates that this is the time young people should appreciate fully the joy of being alive before moving on to a glorious future (something that any young person can expect to be told by their elders).<br />\n(3 stars - James Donald; June 10, 2011)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Age of 14 or 15 = Shi si wu sui</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Lin A&#8217;mian, Zhao Yuan and Beijing Children&#8217;s Film Company</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1985</p>", "description": "<p>Over the past hundred years, the age of 14 has become an extremely influential period in the average educated Chinese person&#8217;s life.

In Europe, the US or Australia, a whole genre of films have sought to capture this right of passage in a young person&#8217;s life, where they explore their changing bodies, their own sense of identity and the world of ideas and morality. But these experiences don&#8217;t even count for small change in China.</p>\n<p>A boarding school filled with young adults might invite these connotations in Western countries, however we are shown this period is influential for completely different reasons in the PRC. The beginning of junior high means the pressure is really on: From this moment on, the young teens face extreme competition with one another in order to excel in their studies and make the grade for the best possible high-school, which is the only way of standing a chance at university admission.</p>\n<p>It is therefore a period of both extreme tension and vigorous excitement. No longer treated as children, these young adults feel that they have been invested with the responsibility for their own fate.

As in all her film work, Wertmuller combines sexual comedy with a sharp and subversive reworking of socialist and feminist themes. As the film progresses and we see the interaction between prostitutes, anarchists and Fascists, we become less sure of what is real and what is merely artiface in the world of politics. Wertmuller has pioneered a cinema that reveals politics is as much a style as it is didactism, as much performance as it is commitment. The poor foolish Tunin, who believes in love and justice, is the archetype of the Fool. The music is by Nino Rota.

father she never knew, and curious about the war that took him away - the war nobody wants to remember. Bruce Willis plays a reclusive vet in this story of a family&#8217;s struggle to heal the wounds of Vietnam. This film captures both the horror of battle and the disillusionment of a young soldier who thought war meant glory. Norman Jewison directs this heartfelt and powerful movie highlighted by one of the most poignant final scenes ever filmed - the family&#8217;s emotionally stirring, almost wordless visit to the Vietnam Veteran&#8217;s Memorial in Washington D.C. &#8220;In country&#8221; is the term American GI&#8217;s used for their time in Vietnam.

Upon losing the war, the size of the German armed forces was restricted, to ensure that Germany did not become a military threat in Europe. In the 1920s the desire for new technology and military designs was urgent, and following Hitler&#8217;s rise to power in the 1930s, much of the research and development was conducted clandestinely. Despite restrictions, a massive and formidable air force - The Luftwaffe - was born, and Germany&#8217;s armed forces burgeoned. This documentary uses extensive archival footage, much of it recently recovered from the East and viewed for the first time, to display these weapons of war. The role of Hitler and Hermann Goering is discussed at length, as these two warmongers contributed to the fortunes of the Luftawaffe throughout WW2. Features extensive and fascinating black and white footage of Europe from the 1910s, 20s, 30s and 40s, showing the incredible devastation of war on the land and people.

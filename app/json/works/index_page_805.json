tells the story of three white men and an indigenous tracker in pursuit of a fugitive. The Tracker (David Gulpilil) is a native policeman during a time in which trackers were employed to find suspects. He answers to The Fanatic (Gary Sweet), a cruel bigot who is hell bent on catching The Fugitive, an aboriginal man accused of murdering a white woman. The Follower (Damon Gameau), is a naive young colonial policeman new to the job while The Veteran (Grant Page) is a world weary man whose kind nature is overridden by what he must do and how society expects him to treat blacks. The three white men are ultimately dependent on the silent, ever watchful tracker. When an interrogation of some bush blacks turns into a massacre, the balance of power shifts and assumed notions of truth and justice are thrown into question. While the film tackles the brutal treatment of Aborigines by white police, De Heer averts a realist portrayal of graphic violence by cutting to paintings (by South Australian artist, Peter Coad) that represent the scenes of brutality and bloodshed. With its sparse use of dialogue, but much of the film&#8217;s thematic content - about the displacement of Aboriginal peoples by white settlers, and conflict between white and indigenous systems of justice - is conveyed through songs written by Graham Tardif and performed for the film by indigenous musician, Archie Roach. David Gulpilil won an AFI Award for best actor for his role in the film. Written by Rolf de Heer ; cinematography by Ian Jones ; editing by Tania Nehme.

When Annie Mary realises that her best friend is dying, she desperately tries to raise money for a trip to Disneyland by forming a pop group and entering a talent contest, with one thousand pounds in prize money. A comedy of sorts, &#8220;Very Annie Mary&#8221; features several song and dance routines in the mode of &#8220;The Full Monty&#8221; and like that film, the depressed economy is the backdrop against which the townspeople hope to illicit a modicum of happiness from their penny pinching lives. Director Sara Sugarman is also responsible for the script.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962042, "name": "Film Four International", "creator_id": 23614, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962043, "name": "Arts Council of Wales", "creator_id": 35034, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962044, "name": "Studio Canal+", "creator_id": 26312, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962045, "name": "Arts Council of Great Britain", "creator_id": 11978, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962046, "name": "Damian Jones", "creator_id": 51310, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q5212274", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962047, "name": "Graham Broadbent", "creator_id": 79780, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q934624", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962048, "name": "Sara Sugarman", "creator_id": 80225, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3403718", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50865", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32822], "external_references": [{"id": 2467, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3402990"}, {"id": 6545, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "62956"}]}, {"id": 89502, "acmi_id": "312301", "title": "Vertigo [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "vertigo-dvd", "creator_credit": "Universal Pictures and Alfred Hitchcock", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1958", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Arguably one of Hitchcock&#8217;s greatest films, &#8220;Vertigo&#8221; is a tense and riveting film about obsession, desire and betrayal.

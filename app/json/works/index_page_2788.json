With Kate unwell, George asks that Ellen return home as carer - a role which Ellen resents, as it will take her away from her boyfriend and literary career in New York. &#8220;One true thing&#8221;, a high-brow tearjerker, utilises melodrama to portray the central conflict of the family that is always subtly at war with itself. At times turgid and predictable the drama is nevertheless effective, mostly due to the strong performances of the three lead actors as they portray adults bourgeoning with thwarted desires and misplaced loyalties. Cast includes Meryl Streep, Renee Zelweger and William Hurt.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:02:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death - Psychological aspects", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 961985, "name": "Carl Franklin", "creator_id": 80215, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961984, "name": "Harry Ufland", "creator_id": 80214, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961983, "name": "Jesse Beaton", "creator_id": 80213, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961982, "name": "Ufland Productions", "creator_id": 80212, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961981, "name": "Monarch Pictures", "creator_id": 80211, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961980, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961979, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 19888, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Do0qiRJasuWkYvnjbwfm3eUhxj.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "One true thing (Carl Franklin) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50831", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [32792]}, {"id": 89596, "acmi_id": "46718", "title": "One trick pony", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "one-trick-pony", "creator_credit": "Robert Young, Michael Tannen, Michael Hausman and Warner Bros Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/isQnHWOeSr8gmYxwOS4CL6RHThN.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Paul Simon used his own knowledge and experience of the rock music industry in writing the script to &#8220;One Trick Pony&#8221;.

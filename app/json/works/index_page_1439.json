The program examines various issues in the debate about welfare and social justice. This examination is based on the people who are directly involved and various points of view are put forth. Central to the program is the reality of day to day functioning of the Centre as it works with the alienation and frustration of the young people who seek support there. The presentation is frank, and will promote lively discussion on the issues of welfare and homelessness.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Homelessness", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Public welfare"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 770686, "name": "Don Parham", "creator_id": 22095, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 770685, "name": "Educational Media Australia", "creator_id": 11964, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "35638", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [19305]}, {"id": 86249, "acmi_id": "307905", "title": "Something wild", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "something-wild", "creator_credit": "Jonathan Demme, Kenneth Utt and Primitiva Religiosa", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1986", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1986-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Uptight tax consultant Charlie (Jeff Daniels) is picked up by eccentric, free-thinker Lulu (Melanie Griffith).

In 1985, it was voted number 1 in Sinclair User’s ‘Top 50 Spectrum Software Classics’.</p>\n<p>To create the game Beam’s director Alfred Milgrom advertised on the bulletin board at Melbourne University hiring students Veronika Megler and Philip Mitchell. Originally tasked with making the “best adventure game ever’.  Milgrom secured a licence to use J.R.R Tolkien’s popular book the <i>The Hobbit</i> by using Melbourne House’s book publishing relationships, and promising that a copy of the book was to be included with the game. The inclusion of the book with the game was also valuable to the player, as knowledge of the story was needed to solve the challenges that  Megler had designed.</p>\n<p><i>The Hobbit</i> was remarkable for both its sophisticated parser and creation of a world that appeared open – were time passed, objects had physics and characters autonomy.</p>\n<p>The games interface, Philip Mitchell’s parser Inglish allowed for full sentences with adjectives, where previously most adventure games only allowed for simpler verb-noun combinations. The program was complex enough to intuitively understand pronouns, adverbs, punctuation and prepositions. This allowed players to interact with the games in a way never before possible.

Set in the Bahamas, &#8220;Thunderball&#8221; provides plenty of lush scenery with spectacular beaches, sprawling mansions and beautiful women in bathing costumes. The under water setting allows for some spectacular ideas and elaborate set pieces. Typical Bond touches include a myriad of one liners and nubile lady friends including a masseuse; Largo&#8217;s mistress; a British spy; and an enemy agent. Highlights include a Mardi Gras sequence with James evading capture due to a frenetic, chaotic moment. Other fine moments are the irascible Q displaying Bond&#8217;s latest gadgets whilst whingeing about being dragged to the Bahamas in order to do so. Re-made in 1993 as &#8220;Never say never again.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:06:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Espionage", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Terrorism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816707, "name": "Kevin McClory", "creator_id": 35807, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817399, "name": "Danjaq", "creator_id": 28353, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817400, "name": "Eon Productions", "creator_id": 35806, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817402, "name": "Terence Young", "creator_id": 26085, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q314882", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 817403, "name": "Ken Adam", "creator_id": 72649, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production designer", "role_id": 966, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 817398, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51733", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [33388], "external_references": [{"id": 24052, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q107724"}]}, {"id": 86518, "acmi_id": "308203", "title": "The Woman Suffers", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-woman-suffers", "creator_credit": "Raymond Longford and National Film and Sound Archive of Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1918", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1918-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This 1918 Australian feature is one of the most significant surviving treasures of a silent film heritage which is now largely extinct.

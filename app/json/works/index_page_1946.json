(Neil LaBute, 1997), examines the politics and frissons that arise between two women of different age and class, over the course of one eventful evening. Julie Styron (Stockard Channing) is an astute vice president who, having forfeited intimate relationships, has achieved great success in her career. Panicked by an unexpected call from her boss, she calls on head-hunter Nick Harris (Frederick Weller) fishing for clues. When Paula Murphy (Julia Stiles), a temp who is hired to assist Julie with an important presentation, shows up late, Julie vents her frustration by instantaneously firing her. Later that evening, feeling faintly repentant, Julie buys Paula a drink in the hotel bar, which leads to debauchery. Despite Julie&#8217;s reluctance, Nick joins them, forming an instant attraction to Paula, and from there the film takes a dramatic turn as Nick is drugged (by Paula) and the women conspire to exact revenge upon his prone body. Despite being linked by gender and the shared experience of operating within a patriarchy, money, knowledge and age divide these women, making them, at times, adversarial.

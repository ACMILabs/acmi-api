The narrative, which is violent and at times gruesome in depicting the bleak interpersonal relationships between the characters, suffers from an overabundance of incidents, veering from one tragedy to the next - a feature that undermines its ability to maintain dramaturgical energy and achieve the uncompromising impact that it strives for.

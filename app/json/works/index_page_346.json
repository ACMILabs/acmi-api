They play piggy-back in the pool, use plastic kickboards and sit in an improvised plastic boat.</p>\n<p>The film shows scenes of children swimming laps in an outdoor inbuilt swimming pool which could be at St Catherine’s School, Toorak. We can see some impressive buildings in the background which could be a part of the school or neighbouring houses.</p>\n<p>There is a lovely scene of a young boy riding his tricycle along a leafy suburban street, lined with large houses. The street could be Cleeve Court in Toorak.</p>\n<p>We see a young girl playing on a swing surrounded by a beautiful garden in full bloom.</p>\n<p>The film finishes with a trip to the country for horse riding lessons. We see the horses being saddled up while they stand under a Hills Hoist clothes line, and the children are taken through their rising trot and cantering paces. The horse riding instructors use wooden sign posts and mallets to mark out a course for the young horse riders.</p>\n<p>This film shows great examples of fashion, including swimwear, children’s recreational activities including horse riding and swimming, play equipment, toys and architecture typical of the era.</p>\n<p>Originally made using 16mm film</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights list:<br />\n00:00:56:00 Children playing with long pieces of cane with mid-century modern house in background<br />\n00:03:36:00 Small boy and a butterfly on a garden path<br />\n00:05:29:00 Brother and sister sit by the swimming pool eating biscuits<br />\n00:07:43:00 Mother goes for a swim – good example of swimwear<br />\n00:08:35:00 Three children play in a wading pool<br />\n00:09:56:00 Children swim laps in an outdoor pool, perhaps at St Catherine’s School, Toorak<br />\n00:10:26:00 Children dive into an outdoor pool as above<br />\n00:10:37:00 Boy on tricycle riding down a street lined with grand houses, perhaps Cleeve Court, Toorak<br />\n00:11:25:00 Children play in wading pool with kickboards and improvised boat</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Brookes Family Home Movies: Reel 10]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>John Brookes</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1964-1966</p>", "description": "<p>This film comprises a slice of family life in suburban Melbourne.</p>\n<p>The first scene shows children playing in their backyard under a homemade cubby house constructed of bed sheets, cardboard and possibly curtains.

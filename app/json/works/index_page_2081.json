At dinner, son Nicolas (Adrien de Van) abruptly announces that he is gay. His sister, Sophie (Adrien&#8217;s real-life sister, Marina de Van), attempts suicide, leaving herself a bitter paraplegic, while her boyfriend, David, tries to prove his undying love to her by engaging in a series of humiliating sadomasochistic experiences. The situation becomes more complicated when Maria refuses to do any cleaning, and gets caught seducing David, and her teacher husband, Abdu, becomes Nicolas&#8217; sexual mentor. Helene, unable to understand what has happened to her family but determined to resolve matters, decides to begin by having sex with her son to &#8220;cure&#8221; him of his homosexuality. Through all this mayhem, Jean manages to stay calm, until he is forced by the family to give up his beloved pet rat. In a scene reminiscent of &#8220;The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover&#8221;, the rat is disposed of, a bizarre act that has extraordinary consequences for the entire household. &#8220;Sitcom&#8221; was screened in the International Critics Week section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.

But when the selfish King fails to pay for his services, the Piper takes drastic measures. King Midas and the golden touch (27 mins, 1997): A King, who was revelled in a life of wealth and privilege, discovers he has the power to turn all that he touches into gold - but he loses his perspective when he gets caught up in the desire for endless riches. This short film is humorous and quite funky, featuring several groovy musical interludes. Both of these lightly comic fables for children gently moralise about the dangers of avarice, greed, duplicity and selfishness, whilst underscoring the importance of family and tolerance. Features the voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Richard Moll, John Ratzenberger, Grant Shaud, Wesley Snipes, Blair Underwood and Alfonso Ribeiro.

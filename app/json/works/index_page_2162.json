Rogers shows a large scale version of the Millikan experiment by which the value of the Coulomb force constant can be determined. Shows a large scale version of the Millikan experiment. The small charged plates of the original experiment are made very large and the effects are show of increasing plate area and separation and adding more batteries to charge the plates. The same electric field strength used in the Millikan experiment enables the experimenter to count the number of elementary charges on an object and measure the constant in Coulomb&#8217;s law of electric forces.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:33:34:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Electric measurement", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Physics", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - History", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 849979, "name": "Richard Leacock", "creator_id": 14102, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849978, "name": "Educational Services, Inc.", "creator_id": 14101, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film;

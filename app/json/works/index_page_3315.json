Through some excellent underwater photography, including a remote video camera attached to a shark, we see the natural behaviour and environment of the Great White and up-close shots of not just one, but several sharks as they swim, hunt and mate. Mostly filmed around the oceans of Cape Coast at the southern most tip of South Africa, this documentary is both educational and entertaining.

When a handsome young music student, Walter (Benoit Magimel), attempts to seduce Erika, his forthright masculinity and her own masochistic desires create an untenable situation for the piano teacher.

It is nevertheless a consistent and unforgettable investigation of Western culture at a point of spiritual collapse. And the film is unimaginable without Huppert whose performance allows us to both understand individual suffering and the wider social and political analogies that Haneke wants to draw through her character.

The James-Younger Gang consisted of three sets of siblings (Jesse and Frank James, Cole, Jim and Bob Younger, and Ed and Clell Miller) and it is Walter Hill&#8217;s conceit with &#8220;The Long Riders&#8221; to have three sets of Hollywood siblings play the gang members (James and Stacy Keach play the James&#8217;; David, Keith and Robert Carradine are the Youngers; Randy and Dennis Quaid, the Millers). It can be seen that in many respects &#8220;The Long Riders&#8221;, made at the beginning of the 1980s, inaugurated Hollywood&#8217;s obsession in that decade for pastiche and uncritical homage as opposed to the revisionism of genre that dominated the American cinema of the early seventies. Beautifully shot by cinematographer Ric Waite, who uses the lush southern United States locales to recall the mythological terrain of the John Ford westerns, and featuring original music by Ry Cooder which is faithful to the musical legacy of the United States Civil War, &#8220;The Long Riders&#8221; is, for all the directness of its violence, language and sexual lives of the gang, very much a traditional western.

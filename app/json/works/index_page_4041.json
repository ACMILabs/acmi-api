Using flowers from plants and trees, Bach had, by the time of his death, discovered 38 remedies which he divided into seven groups: fear; uncertainty; insufficient interest in present circumstances; loneliness; over-sensitivity to influence and ideas; despondency or despair; over care for the welfare of others. Filmed at Mount Vernon, the cottage in Oxfordshire where Dr Edward Bach spent the last years of his life, Brenda Longman (presenter and narrator) discusses various aspects of the remedies with John Ramsell and Judy Howard (trustees and curators of Mount Vernon) including a demonstration in making up the remedies, the process of determining the right remedy for a particular type of person, self-help advice and examples of remedies for depression and anger. A recommended reading list is provided at the end of the program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:07:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Flowers", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alternative medicine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Bach, Edward, 1886-1936", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Health education", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Herbs - Therapeutic use", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-care - Health", "People&nbsp;→ Bach, Edward, 1886-1936"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816018, "name": "David Sherrington", "creator_id": 34199, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 811884, "name": "Alternative View", "creator_id": 34198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50041", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [32051]}, {"id": 65189, "acmi_id": "000966", "title": "Babyhood", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "babyhood", "creator_credit": "Eileen Molony, George Luger and BBC-TV", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1963", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;The Springs of learning&#8221;.<br />\nA paediatrician analyses the stages of development during the first year of a child&#8217;s life.

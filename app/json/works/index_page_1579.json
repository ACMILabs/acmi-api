Woody Allen plays Isaac Davis, a comedy writer whose wife (Meryl Streep) has left him for another woman. Isaac is intending to write a book about his romantic entanglements but his work is constantly interrupted by the demands of two ex-wives, his guilt over his relationship with a precocious 17 year old schoolgirl (Mariel Hemingway) and his affair with his best-friend&#8217;s mistress (Diane Keaton). Managing to be biting and romantic, elegant and satirically funny, &#8220;Manhattan&#8221; defined the social mores of the educated urban bourgeoisie at the tail end of the &#8220;Me Generation&#8221;.

Like many recent films from Iran, this one has a simple plot line, light humour, a humanitarian streak, and resonance due to its use of metaphor and rather complex themes. The film starts with concerned neighbours signing a petition for social workers to investigate a home where their blind mother and out-of-work father have locked up two girls for eleven years. Social workers &#8220;rescue&#8221; the (now severely intellectually and socially stunted) girls then give them back to their parents. What follows is an initiation period in which a social worker and the father have a seriocomic encounter whereby he gets a kind of comeuppance and the girls venture into the neighbourhood and begin to make friends despite their lack of social skills.

A successful but angst ridden German art critic, established in London, is contacted by a student friend from the 1960s to assassinate a Chilean military torturer. Approaching a comfortable middle age, he is unsettled by the disruption which forces him to confront his political convictions and choose between the activism of his youth or the complacency and security of his present life. Filmed on location in London and Hamburg.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Colin McCabe ; director, Andi Engel ; writer, Andi Engel, Lewis Rodia ; phototography, Denis Crossan ; editing, Christopher Roth ; music, Simon Fisher Turner.<br />\nCast: Jeroen Krabbe, Susannah York, Ulrich Wildgruber, Kate Hardie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Chile - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Students - Political activity", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ Europe - Politics and government - 20th century"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816539, "name": "Colin MacCabe", "creator_id": 79646, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889348, "name": "BFI", "creator_id": 68434, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889350, "name": "Andi Engel", "creator_id": 82185, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55682978", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146295", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}, {"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [55152]}, {"id": 115657, "acmi_id": "A000014", "title": "War requiem", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "war-requiem", "creator_credit": "James MacKay, Anglo International Films, British Broadcasting Corporation and Derek Jarman", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1989", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1989-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 1752, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3545643"}], "brief_description": "<p>Cinematic interpretation of Benjamin Britten&#8217;s 1961 masterly religious/poetic choral oratorio, combining the Latin Mass with several poems by the British war poet Wilfred Owen.

Complications arise when the younger policeman falls in love with the dancer, whose suitablity as a Swiss citizen is under question. Realised with a lighter touch than many other satirical films by Swiss directors that parody Swiss society, the film tends towards slapstick and features restrained performances by character actor Luond and cabaret performer Steinberger, as the two policemen. The opening lecture is influenced by the Swiss-born Jean-Luc Godard.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Marcel Hoehn ; director, Rolf Lyssy ; writers, Rolf Lyssy, Christa Maerker ; photography, Fritz E.

His work as an illustrator was well known to Australians through his work in newspapers and magazines. Both Percy Perplexed and Cookery Nook were produced at a time when sound films were changing the face of cinema. &#8216;Cookery Nook&#8217; may have been screened in the Dried Fruits van that toured the country promoting dried fruits to community and mothers’ groups.

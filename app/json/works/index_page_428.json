Meredith, (Charlotte Rampling), lives for the moment and the next man. Currently that man is Jos played by Alan Bates. When Meredith becomes pregnant, it is Georgy who becomes maternal, and the object of not only Jos&#8217;s affection, but that of a lascivious wealthy widower played by James Mason. Ultimately, Georgy gets all that she desires. Lynn Redgrave touchingly conveys Georgy&#8217;s warmth and naivety, while Rampling gives an excellent performance as the moody and insensitive Meredith.

It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America. Near the end of the film Billy shows a few scenes from ‘Stanley Park’ in Vancouver, Canada which included the ‘Zoo and children’s farmyard’ at the time, which has since been closed.</p>\n<p>Selected

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria.

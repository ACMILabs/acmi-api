Although Vertov&#8217;s film has been linked with the so-called &#8216;city symphonies&#8217;, Vertov is not concerned with the abstract formalism of films like Berlin but with a philosophical reflection on the power of the camera over &#8216;reality&#8217;. Vertov rejected the contemporary fiction film in favour of recording unstaged &#8216;reality&#8217;, what he called &#8216;instants of life&#8217;. Yet his concern was also with the nature of cinematographic illusion. He constantly reminds the audience of the camera&#8217;s presence and of the film being edited and screened. As such his influence extends across the filmmaking spectrum from cinema verite&#8217;s preoccupation with unstaged reality to experimental self-reflexiveness and the preoccupation of filmmakers like Godard with the ideology of representation.

Starting off in swinging London of the sixties, the film quickly moves into the present when Austin Powers must travel across time to stop Dr. Evil&#8217;s world conquering exploits, who has cryogenically frozen himself (and his cat Mr. Bigglesworth) and resurfaced in the nineties. Much of the films fish out of water humour is based on the difficulty Austin has in adjusting to a modern world that has little tolerance for a promiscuous, sexist, British secret agent with bad teeth and Dr Evil&#8217;s thwarted plans to outsmart a society that is far more advanced in notions of evil. Cast also includes Mimi Rogers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York and Robert Wagner.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Spy films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Low temperature engineering"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Captioned"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 908852, "name": "New Line Cinema", "creator_id": 68072, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 908853, "name": "Suzanne Todd", "creator_id": 68879, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7650980", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 908854, "name": "Demi Moore", "creator_id": 68883, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q43044", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 908855, "name": "Jennifer Todd", "creator_id": 68878, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1611265", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 908856, "name": "Mike Myers", "creator_id": 68800, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q185724", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 908857, "name": "Jay Roach", "creator_id": 68882, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q524278", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 908851, "name": "ScreenSound Australia", "creator_id": 16130, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46328", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [28794]}]}

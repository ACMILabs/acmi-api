Carlos Saura amasses an impressive range of artists, over 300, who sing, dance and play music, expressing stories with fervour, dignity and evident respect for the tradition of flamenco art. With little dialogue, narratives are expressed through rumba, tango, ballet, taranta, song and music, in a variety of moods and styles, often in small collaborations but also in groups of twenty or more. A minimalist setting, the old Plaza de Armas train station in Seville, is transformed into an impromptu space, beautifully photographed with dramatic lighting highlighting the sense of theatre, drawing attention to expressive performances. These performers, who vary in age from children to the elderly, give an extraordinary recital, which embraces and celebrates culture. Includes: Paco de Lucia, Manolo Sanlucar, Lole Manuel, Jose Menese, Jose Merce, Mario Maya, Belen Maya, Carmen Linares, Manolo Sanlucar, Maria Pages, Joaquin Cortes, Juana la del Revuelo, Matilde Coral, Enrique Morente, Aurora Vargas, La Paquera de Jerez, Paco Toronjo, Paco de Lucia, Fernanda de Utrera, Merche Esmeralda, Remedies Amaya, Moratio Chico, Nino Jero and Paco del Gastor.

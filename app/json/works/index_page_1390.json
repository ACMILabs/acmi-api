Borg emerges purged, if not wholly changed from this confrontation with self. The theme of the film, incarnated in the successive generations of the Borgs, is death-in-life, emotional-spiritual atrophy. It has been compared with King Lear and Strindberg&#8217;s Dream Play and in structure with a Bach fugue. Wild strawberries are a Swedish symbol for the emergence of spring, the rebirth of life. Also available on 16mm and VHS.</p>\n<p>Credits: [Producer, Allan Ekelund] ; director, writer, Ingmar Bergman ; photography, Gunnar Fischer ; music, Erik Nordgren.<br />\nCast: Victor Sjostrom, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Sweden", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Foreign language films", "People&nbsp;→ Autobiographical memory"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1816584, "name": "Allan Ekelund", "creator_id": 28166, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2837702", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889426, "name": "Svensk Filmindustri", "creator_id": 12124, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889428, "name": "Ingmar Bergman", "creator_id": 10138, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7546", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146319", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 43, "name": "Sweden", "slug": "sweden"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1957", "notes": "", "to_year": "1957"}], "labels": [55173], "external_references": [{"id": 261, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q239756"}]}, {"id": 86328, "acmi_id": "307993", "title": "Smuggler's Cove", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "smugglers-cove", "creator_credit": "Tom Broadbridge, Andromeda Productions and Peter Sharp", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1983", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A day surfing for a group of teenagers turns into the adventure of a lifetime when they stumble across a group of cut-throat drug smugglers.

Rather than looking at just one level of the light spectrum - that which can be seen, exploration now makes accessible light from across the entire spectrum. (25 mins) Episode two &#8220;Galactic Splendours&#8221; takes a photographic tour of the Milky Way using the world&#8217;s best astrophotographs. Discover why we can never see the whole picture of our galaxy when we are a part of it, as well as an explanation of the electromagnetic forces which hold the galaxy together. (22 mins) Episode three &#8220;Shadows and signs&#8221; takes a look at the heavens through the eyes of the ancient and not-so-ancient. From Stonehenge to the ancient Egyptians, from Babylon to the Mayan temples of Central America, explore the skies and discover how the universe affects the lives of ourselves and our ancestors.

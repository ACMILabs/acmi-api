Boarding at a theatrical residence, where an atmosphere of gay penury prevails, Terry&#8217;s housemates attempt to demystify her idealism with their realistic take on an actress&#8217; life - the casting couch, sugar daddies, endless futile auditions and a dearth of work for the talented and talent-less alike. Sharing a room with Terry is Jean (Ginger Rogers) a sassy tap dancer, accustomed to clashing with her fellow thespians, who forms a truce with the secretly wealthy Terry. With the show business setting and putting-on-a-show structure of many classic Hollywood musicals, &#8220;Stage door&#8221; also contains dramatic turns that relay the dark side and perils of the business. Cast includes: Adolphe Menjou, Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, Ann Miller, Constance Collier. Adapted from the Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman stage hit.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theater"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2308288, "name": "Gregory La Cava", "creator_id": 77899, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q269585", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2308285, "name": "Pandro S.

She then leaves the provinces and goes to search for him in Prague. Forman uses this simple theme to present a realist and comic view of 1960&#8217;s Czechoslovakia, in which he examines young love, the generation gap, and the working of bureaucracy. His unflinchingview of the everyday gave the film a unique quality at the time, but he also observes his characters with warmth and affection, revealing their inner strength in the face of adversity. Besides finding humour in the everyday, he also draws on the traditions of silent comedy.

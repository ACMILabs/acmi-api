The lawyer assumes that the mysterious and yet unnamed character is married. The following day an accusing Lord Mee (Ralph Richardson) talks of his wife spending the night in a man&#8217;s room. Smitten and bewildered Everard Logan is forced to think of the consequences believing that he might know the clients of a divorce case that he is working on better than he thought! This easy going yet sophisticated comedy is well performed and enjoyable.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2345552, "name": "Tim Wheelan", "creator_id": 36826, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3528710", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2345551, "name": "Alexander Korda", "creator_id": 14654, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55221", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2345548, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q219400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2345544, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52763", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [34238]}, {"id": 94721, "acmi_id": "318709", "title": "Blowing hot and cold", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "blowing-hot-and-cold", "creator_credit": "Marc Gracie, Rosa Colosimo, Chancom and Colosimo Film Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1988", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 2070, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4928591"}], "brief_description": "<p>Set on location in a small country town in Victoria this is a story of two unlikely individuals, a world apart socially and culturally, brought together through a set of circumstances.

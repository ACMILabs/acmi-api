Highlights include: complete stereo soundtrack, breathtaking footage shot entirely on 16mm film and loads of steam trains to see and hear!</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroads - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 783126, "name": "Nick A'Hern Productions", "creator_id": 25822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783127, "name": "ABC Video", "creator_id": 22384, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 783128, "name": "Nick A'Hern", "creator_id": 72736, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 783125, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 783129, "name": "Steve Bisley", "creator_id": 72737, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "narrator", "role_id": 499, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39639", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [23200], "external_references": []}, {"id": 73184, "acmi_id": "010226", "title": "Steam", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "steam", "creator_credit": "Great Britain.

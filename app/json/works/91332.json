Angst also exists between the commercial fishermen and those who practise recreational fishing. For Joe Pizzone, who has given up 26 years of shark fishing in Bass Strait for a new life as an inlet fisherman, owning his own boat and spending more time with his family, the threat of marine parks to his livelihood becomes the new challenge in his life. The documentary follows Joe as he goes about his daily life as a professional fisherman, revealing the harsh conditions, the long hours and the constant battle with the weather, the good days and the bad days and his absolute passion and determination to not just stand by and let bureaucracy and the &#8220;greenies&#8221; take over without a fight.

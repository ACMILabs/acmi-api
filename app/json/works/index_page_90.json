Anthony Andrews is the dashing and elegant Sir Percy, Jane Seymour plays his lovely French wife Marguerite and Ian McKellen is Chauvelin, Sir Percy&#8217;s arch enemy. The costumes are sumptuous and the dialogue witty.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "History&nbsp;→ France - History - Revolution, 1789-1799", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-scarlet-pimpernel", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954229, "name": "London Film Productions", "creator_id": 14653, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954230, "name": "David Conroy", "creator_id": 24765, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954231, "name": "Clive Donner", "creator_id": 27426, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 954228, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41446", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [24937], "external_references": [{"id": 923, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7762445"}, {"id": 6217, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "23615"}]}]}

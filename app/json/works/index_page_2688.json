He must share his cell with four other inmates: Roland, Manu, Monseigneur and Jo. The four have a plan to escape by digging a hole under their cell to connect with the sewers. Annoyed by Claude&#8217;s sudden arrival, they, albeit reluctantly, agree to share their plan with him. And so, Claude becomes a reluctant accomplice. Becker, in his last film before his death in 1960 (aged 54), seemed to be taking a new direction by using non-professional actors and a more austere camera style. With only natural noises as effects in the soundtrack, he builds a meticulously detailed account of the characters&#8217; life in a small space and the preparations for escape. Jose Giovanni, who wrote the screenplay based on his own prison experience, appears at the beginning of the film. &#8220;To hear him tell it, Jose Giovanni never set out to become a writer, or embraced it as a vocation. His focus upon the realities of criminal life was never a social crusade. He wrote &#8216;Le Trou&#8217;, he says, with only one reader in mind: the lawyer Stephen Hecquet to whom the work is dedicated. It was Hecquet who sent the manuscript to a publisher in 1957. Its almost immediate sale to the cinema seemed equally fortuitous: director Jacques Becker had saved a newspaper clipping about the Sante prison break. When the book appeared he summoned the still jittery ex-con to a story meeting &#8230; at the home of Yves Montand and Simone Signoret.(&#8230;) When you are in jail, Jose Giovanni says, and a new person comes into your cell, whether it is a guard or a prisoner, you have to learn how to size them up with a single glance. This is a skill that is very useful later on when dealing with producers.&#8221; Reference: David Chute. &#8216;Jose Giovanni&#8217;. Online. http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Island/3102/jose.htm.

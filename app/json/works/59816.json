    "description": "<p>From seller: A Princess of the Blood gown and overrobe from the 1987 multi Oscar-winning historical drama The Last Emperor. These women can be seen on several occasions throughout the movie, when PuYi chooses his secondary consort, and at PuYi&#8217;s wedding to the Empress. This stunning and elaborate costume consists of a full-length gown of printed red rayon satin, overprinted with dragon robe motif, similarly printed sleeveless overrobe. Also included is a black satin headband with gold filigree buttons (some have been lost over the years) and a string of glass beads and polished stones that hang down the chest, and a cream quilted cotton under robe.<br />\nIt comes from the private collection of renowned producer Jeremy Thomas (who single handedly raised the $25million budget for the movie) and was archived after filming completed until only recently, when the Prop Store was proud to assist in sorting and cataloguing the incredible inventory under the guidance and in collaboration with Oscar-winning Costume Designer, Jim Acheson.</p>",

        "<p>Colour had arrived in cinema when The Last Emperor (1987) was released but its use in costume and cinematography was Oscar-winning. The film follows Pu Yi’s transition from the last emperor of China to ordinary citizen and colour is fundamental to his journey. Deep crimson and orange hues capture both the majesty and innocence of his childhood in the Forbidden City, while grey saturates moments in jail later in life. This costume by James Acheson enlivens the Imperial court with rich reds that bring grandeur to the screen, further reinforced by 9,500 extras that appear to be draped in delicately embroidered silk thanks to screen-printed rayon.</p>"

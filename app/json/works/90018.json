In Turkey he encounters his Aunt&#8217;s surrogate family and decides to stay on in Istanbul and restore an old hamam (Turkish bath). Francesco finds that not only is he attracted to the generosity of his new &#8220;family&#8221;, he also finds himself sexually attracted to the son, Mehmet. When his wife Marta arrives from Italy they find themselves locked in a bitter exchange that strips bare the lies and evasions that underpin their marriage.

And for both of them, with the destruction of their marriage and the intervention of violent tragedy, they discover themselves recreating the Aunt&#8217;s original exile.

Cast includes Dennis Haysbert, Michael Harris, Mel Harris, Sab Shimono and Dina Merrill.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sundance Film Festival - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amnesia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Twins"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962888, "name": "David Siegel", "creator_id": 80431, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962887, "name": "Scott McGehee", "creator_id": 80430, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962886, "name": "Kino-Korsakoff", "creator_id": 35561, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962885, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20074, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/89jGoGPFqOl6JR144iEOxeciggM.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Suture (Scott McGehee; David Siegel) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51357", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1993", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1993"}], "labels": [33201]}, {"id": 117303, "acmi_id": "B2002637", "title": "Sustainable Ouyen", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sustainable-ouyen", "creator_credit": "Csilla Csongvay, David Withers and ACMI", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, JUL 2012", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/B2002637_SustainableOuyen.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI Viewing Booths", "last_on_display_date": "2019-04-22", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>Several years ago a group of Ouyen Primary School students petitioned their local council to adopt a community-recycling program.

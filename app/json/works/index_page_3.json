"<p>This film comprises a slice of family life in suburban Melbourne.</p>\n<p>The first scene shows children playing in their backyard under a homemade cubby house constructed of bed sheets, cardboard

Children enjoy themselves duck-diving for coins, wearing diving masks and somersaulting under water. We see a delightful interaction between siblings as they sit in the sunshine and eat biscuits together.</p>\n<p>We see a young child standing beside their mother. She is gardening dressed in her full-piece 1960s swimming costume.</p>\n<p>Three children play together in a wading or paddling pool, filling it up with water from the nearby garden hose. They take great delight in creating a flood, squirting each other with water, splashing and jettisoning the water into the air. They play piggy-back in the pool, use plastic kickboards and sit in an improvised plastic boat.</p>\n<p>The film shows scenes of children swimming laps in an outdoor inbuilt swimming pool which could be at St Catherine’s School, Toorak. We can see some impressive buildings in the background which could be a part of the school or neighbouring houses.</p>\n<p>There is a lovely scene of a young boy riding his tricycle along a leafy suburban street, lined with large houses.

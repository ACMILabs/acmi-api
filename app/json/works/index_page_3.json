The Dame was Loaded has all the hardboiled elements of film noir and is just as cinematic.</p>\n<p>Created using innovative Full Motion Video (FMV) technology, which was developed in-house at Beam Software, this point-and-click adventure incorporated real footage of actors that players interact with to solve the mystery. At the time when computer graphics were limited, PMV games tried to generate empathy in players by putting them in the protagonist’s point of view and presenting other characters as real people in a fully realised game world.</p>\n<p>When it was made it was the largest multimedia production in Australia, with game developers collaborating closely with actors and film crews, who used iconic Melbourne landmarks as settings like the art-deco former police headquarters on Russell Street.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Game"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["CD-ROM videogame.

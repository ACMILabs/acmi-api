From an early age filmmaker Monique Schwarz was puzzled by the discrepancy between the domineering and emasculating Jewish mothers typically represented on film, and her own mother, a Holocaust survivor. &#8220;Mamadrama&#8221; consequently has a strong personal touch, via the reflections of Schwarz and interviews with directors Paul Mazursky, Paul Bogart, and Larry Peerce, and actress Lainie Kazan. In addition to well-known Hollywood movies &#8220;Mamadrama&#8221; uses rare footage from early silent films, Yiddish language features and Israeli films. The tone of the documentary is reflective rather than critical; the most intriguing moments emerge from the candour with which the interviewees discuss their own mothers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Jews - Australia", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Jews", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Jews", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Jews - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Holocaust, Jewish (1939-1945", "History&nbsp;→ Jews - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Jews - History"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2392744, "name": "Monique Schwarz", "creator_id": 75185, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121360927", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2392741, "name": "Amber Films", "creator_id": 20467, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270732", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2392743, "name": "Arte", "creator_id": 30115, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2392742, "name": "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen", "creator_id": 20976, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2392740, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51342", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [33198]}, {"id": 92057, "acmi_id": "315251", "title": "The Gulf between", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-gulf-between", "creator_credit": "Monique Schwarz and Amber Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1991", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1991-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Fired from 1000 kilometers away, 39 scud missiles hit Israel during the Gulf War.

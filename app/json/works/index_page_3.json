The imminent fusion of spirituality with technology; flesh with machine and psychedelia with cybernetics is confidently proclaimed.</p>\n<p>Cyberdelia is a visual and aural feast with the film-makers channelling the post-modern mischief and transcendental yearnings of the ‘cyberdelic’ movement to radical stylistic effect. Stunning cyber artist works are liberally leveraged as both feature material and interstitial fodder. Low-budget analogue video editing and compositing tools are pushed to the limit while artist on-camera interviews are staged in bizarre fashion so as to maintain the feel of a ‘trip documentary’ from start to finish.</p>\n<p>Cyberdelia stretches the boundaries of arts documentary to portray the brazen idealism and micro-processor powered creativity of these pre World Wide Web visionaries.

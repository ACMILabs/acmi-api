The artwork opens with a striking close-up of a glamorous woman with a pearl in her eye, who is slowly engulfed by water. The artist considers this scene an allegory of the promise that lured her mother’s generation to migrate from the Pacific Islands to countries like New Zealand and Australia in the 1960s.</p>\n<p>The middle section weaves together choreographed performances filmed in a production studio with footage of Pacific Island landscapes. It seeks to capture the dark and chaotic feeling of the current moment, as the climate emergency and rising sea levels wreak catastrophic damage across the Pacific Islands and global south.</p>\n<p>The final scene is created with software more commonly used to develop videogames. This hyper realistic world is filled with towering ice monuments set atop colourful disco flooring and populated by a cast of performers dressed in pink. The artist describes this joyful vision of the future as &#8220;a space of cultural self-actualisation and celebration.&#8221;</p>\n<p><i>The Dark Current</i> reflects how we no longer think of the physical and the virtual as being separate spaces, while celebrating Tiatia’s connection to her family history and Sāmoan culture.</p>\n<p>Angela Tiatia is a Sāmoan and Australian artist who lives and works in Sydney. She works primarily with moving image and performance to explore contemporary culture, in particular the relationships between representation, gender, neo-colonialism and the commodification of body and place.

slasher genre, spawning inferior copies like the &#8220;Friday the 13th&#8221; series (including six sequels of its own), and for a time making the star Jamie Lee Curtis into the premium &#8220;scream queen&#8221;. Later on the conventions of the genre were clevely re-invented for a nineties audience by director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson in &#8220;Scream&#8221;, which plays direct homage to &#8220;Halloween&#8221;. John Carpenter opens his film with an unnerving point of view shot of the young psychotic Michael Myers brutally stabbing his teenage sister to death on Halloween night. Flash forward to Halloween fifteen years later and Michael has escaped the mental institution he had been locked up in. Meanwhile shy, virginal teacher Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her girlfriends are preparing for Halloween, unaware of the menace that lurks in their quiet suburban community. Carpenter makes great use of the sparse, atmospheric music score (which he also composed), and uses to the maximum creepy effect the white mask Michael Myers wears throughout the film. &#8220;Halloween&#8221; also establishes the classic horror genre rule - if you&#8217;re a sexually active teenager, you die! Cast also includes Donald Pleasence, P.J.

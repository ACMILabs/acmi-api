A young girl knits while sitting beside her siblings and two people prepare to ski beside the lodge wearing snow gear typical to the era.</p>\n<p>The second Part of the film is titled &#8220;NEDSA 1964”.

Responsible for running inter-club races, we see the children queuing up to participate in a Slalom event. A race official signals the start, and one by one each participant attempts the course. Some successfully complete it – some do not. There is plenty of footage of people falling over. We see the finishing line banner which reads “Kastle Ski” (a brand of skis) and “Finish”.</p>\n<p>The film shows timekeepers and other event officials waiting at the end of the run with their stopwatches and megaphone.

Karen’s new family, the Corrys, are in the film having visited from the UK.</p>\n<p>Of interest in this film, when Karen arrives at the church there are many onlookers who are there but are not guests. At this period of time it was still customary, particularly in country areas, for members of the community to come along to watch the bridal party arrive and leave the church.</p>\n<p>Later we see Karen preparing to leave for overseas possibly to Indonesia as we view a Garuda airplane from what appears to be the Observation Deck at Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne, when it was still open.</p>\n<p>This film also contains scenes of a new kitten in the family, inside the house and in the yard chasing a rope hanging from the clothes line.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br

Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film captures a major event in the lives of the Nixon family – daughter Karen’s wedding. The fashion on the day is a wonderful example of the late 1980s and the bridesmaids wear Karen’s favourite colour, red. Karen’s new family, the Corrys, are in the film having visited from the UK.</p>\n<p>Of interest in this film, when Karen arrives at the church there are many onlookers who are there but are not guests.

bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film is about family life in Geelong in the 1970s. Children Karen and Stuart have a ride on a motorbike, visits to the beach, to the ‘Bell Brae’ farm and to the snow, Karen’s 9th birthday party (filmed inside so quite dark), preparing for school, sports days and an extended family wedding.

Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to England during 1962 to 1964. On his travel Billy films views of London, English coastlines and towns, including Blackpool, Brighton and Coventry. A feature of this film is the Coventry Cathedral which Billy filmed, possibly when it was being consecrated in 1962. The Cathedral is significant as, having been almost destroyed during a Luftwaffe attack on Coventry in 1940, it was rebuilt in a deliberate modern design alongside the remains in 1956 and came to symbolise peace and reconciliation.

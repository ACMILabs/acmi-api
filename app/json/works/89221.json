Her biggest hurdle&#8217;s are Emir&#8217;s vampy girlfriend and club podium dancer Saida (Beatrice Dalle), whose love for him borders on the obsessive, and Emir&#8217;s own struggle with heroin addiction. Director Yolande Zauberman chooses to treat this twilight world in a naturalistic, unflashy way through the use of hand held camera but heightens the visuals and narrative through the impressive electronic soundtrack which includes dance artists such as Massive Attack, Daft Punk and the Chemical Brothers. In French with English subtitles. Cast also includes Richard Courchet, Gerald Thomassin and Julie Bataille.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Clubbed to death</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Yolande Zauberman, Alain Massiot and Madar</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>France, 1997</p>", "description": "<p>Set in the outskirts of Paris, &#8220;Clubbed to death&#8221; offers a fresh perspective of the rave culture by setting it&#8217;s story amongst the Arab and African immigrant community that populate these poorer suburbs and vibrant dance scene.

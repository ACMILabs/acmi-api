Adapted from the Italian novel by Alberto Moravia, &#8220;Two women&#8221; effectively displays the randomness of war that can turn an individual&#8217;s fate to terror and the deprivations that reduce simple acts of kindness to bitter transactions. Sophia Loren won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Cesira, an uncommon accolade at that time. This is the dubbed version with Sophia Loren dubbing her own voice. Directed by Vittoria De Sica (The Bicycle Thief, Umberto D., Marriage - Italian style).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Women in war", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Italy", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Psychological aspects", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Women - Crimes against", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Italy", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Italian literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962084, "name": "Vittorio De Sica", "creator_id": 25893, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962083, "name": "Carlo Ponti", "creator_id": 71631, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962082, "name": "Societe Generale de Cinematographie", "creator_id": 28336, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962081, "name": "Cocinor", "creator_id": 24737, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962080, "name": "Compagnia Cinematografica Champion Films Marceau", "creator_id": 28335, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50872", "production_places": [{"id": 19, "name": "Italy", "slug": "italy"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [32829]}, {"id": 86287, "acmi_id": "307946", "title": "Two women = La Ciociara", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "two-women-la-ciociara", "creator_credit": "Vittorio De Sica, Carlo Ponti, Societe Generale de Cinematographie, Cocinor and Compagnia Cinematografica Champion Films Marceau", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Italy, 1960", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1960-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>The story centers on a widow (Sophia Loren) who runs a tiny grocery store in Rome.

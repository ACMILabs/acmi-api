As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>In this film the &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; go to Werribee Gorge State Park in Victoria for one of their walks. On this visit, they see spiders, flowers and fungi, look for rock samples and do some fence making and tree planting.</p>\n<p>A particular point of interest is an early Coolabah brand wine cask. Established in 1962, Orlando Coolabah was one of the first commercially successful cask wine brands in Australia and very popular in the 1970s. The wine cask itself was invented and perfected in Australia, initially by Angoves Wines in South Australia.</p>\n<p>This film also shows some mushrooms and the practice of &#8216;mushrooming&#8217; in grassy farm paddocks, equipped with buckets and knives.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:34:00 close-up of a moth on a leaf<br

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows a trip made by the &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; to the Wyperfeld National Park in northwestern Victoria. Wallace as usual focuses on the landscape, flora and fauna and in doing so, captures the arid beauty of the region.

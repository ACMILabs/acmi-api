Upon this deed he earns the wrath of Emit Flesti, the angel overseer who decides to meddle with Cassiel&#8217;s new life. There is also the continuing story of Damiel - the angel who chose to be human for love in the original film - now a short-order cook and happily married, Damiel seeks to guide Cassiel through the labyrinthine ways of the world. Another angel Raphaela seeks to temper Emit&#8217;s wrath and aid Cassiel&#8217;s journey. This sequel, filmed in Berlin, contains some stunning cinematography and set pieces - angels atop iconic structures, observing and sympathetically listening to the ails of the human hearts that they seek to assuage. Wenders&#8217; film falters with a subplot involving arms dealers and a pornographic distribution ring, run by corrupt businessmen exploiting the newly established entry into the East.

The subtle use of an organ throughout the soundtrack maintains a constant state of tension and suspense and adds to the religious and morbid undertones. Harvey uses dreamlike sequences, where Mary enters a ghost world and cannot be seen or heard, which effectively highlights her feelings of marginalisation and creates an image of hysteria and mass paranoia - an effect which has become cliche in horror and suspense.

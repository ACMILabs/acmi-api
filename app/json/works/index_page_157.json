This documentary film tells of the hardships, the appalling working conditions and the exploitation which took place in Queensland between 1863 and 1904 of about 60,000 &#8220;Kanakas&#8221;, mainly men, but some women, slave labourers from the South Pacific Islands, including Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. It follows several Australian Islander descendants as they try to retrace the history of their long-lost relatives and combines their personal stories with archival footage, stills, newsreels and quotes from newspaper articles of the time. Many Australians are unaware of our not so proud past dealings in human trafficking and slave labour and the term &#8220;blackbirding&#8221; (white slave-traders&#8217; term for sailing in and stealing the Islanders) and so &#8220;Sugar slaves&#8221; for that very reason makes compelling viewing. Contains some b&amp;w sequences. Narrated by Jonathan Holmes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Sugar - Manufacture and refining", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Sugar growing - Queensland", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Sugar workers - Queensland", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Oceania", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Pacific Islanders", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture conflict", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnology", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Slave-trade", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "History&nbsp;→ Queensland - History", "History&nbsp;→ Slave labor", "History&nbsp;→ Slave-trade", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery", "Places&nbsp;→ Oceania", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2043705, "name": "Jean Jacques Portail", "creator_id": 80086, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043704, "name": "Trevor Graham", "creator_id": 7252, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043703, "name": "Trevor Graham", "creator_id": 7252, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043702, "name": "Penny Robins", "creator_id": 21176, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043700, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043699, "name": "Arcadia Films", "creator_id": 24193, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043698, "name": "Annamax Media", "creator_id": 28983, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2043697, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2043706, "name": "John Whitteron", "creator_id": 73347, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2043701, "name": "Sharon Connolly", "creator_id": 7265, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who starts to re-evaluate his success driven life. During a conference Jerry writes out a mission statement under a storm of inspiration, distributing it to everyone. When he gets back to work he discovers he&#8217;s been sacked and is left with only one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr) and one loyal employee, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger). Now Jerry has to struggle for his survival both as a sports agent and in his personal life as he is drawn into the lives of Dorothy and her son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki). Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this heart warming romantic comedy which has lots to say about the commerce driven world we live in. Cuba Gooding Jr received and Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (1997) and Tom Cruise received a Golden Globe Award (1997) for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Captioned"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jerry-maguire", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1990957, "name": "Cameron Crowe", "creator_id": 5538, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1990956, "name": "James L.

1990 that illustrates its many and varied people, and their daily struggles. The film contrasts the congested lives of the city&#8217;s working class and with the modern wealth of the government ministers who help build it.</p>\n<p>An anonymous voiceover reflects on the wonder and beauty of the newly built Shanghai Flyover.</p>\n<p>The mayor and a colleague arrive for the government meeting. The remaining ministers, however, remain stuck in severe traffic, causing them to be late to the meeting. The men complain about the daily morning congestion in Shanghai. The meeting at the mayor&#8217;s office commences. They watch a video showing the daily public transport and congestion issues of life in Shanghai. They discuss the amount of time citizens waste year after year commuting back and forth from work. Elderly residents are shown living in inconvenient high-rise apartments to avoid the risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jinghua fixes a wheelchair for his invalid aunty in the extreme heat while his mother looks after his young son. Aunt Chen is wheeled through the residential laneway where she lives on the wheelchair. Her son Baozhu is glad to see her out of the house.</p>\n<p>The mayor visits an inner city suburb to assess the situation. He finds the residents congested and overcrowded. An open-minded and caring man, he looks after the masses.</p>\n<p>A violent thunderstorm hits and the vulnerable housing areas are completely flooded. While residents try frantically to stop the water, the council meets to discuss how to halt the flooding. They discover that the flooding has occurred because the area&#8217;s drainage system has not been repaired for 34 years. Furious, the mayor promises he will lead an investigation to discover why the system has been neglected. Although it is too late to prevent the flooding, the Mayor promises to find a solution as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Tempers shorten as the residents try desperately to save their property. Several days pass, but the water refuses to subside. The council begins to panic.

Anyone who is familiar with Nick Giannopoulos&#8217;s phenomenally successful stage show &#8216;Wogs out of work&#8217;, will find more of the same ground covered in &#8216;The Wog boy&#8217; as the film broadly lampoons various Australian stereotypes about first and second generation migrants being a bunch of dole cheating, bludgers. Whether star Giannopoulos, director Aleksi Vellis and co-writer Chris Anastassiades achieve their aim of defusing these racist representations by mocking them will entirely depend on whether you think the old fashioned racial jokes on parade here are actually funny.

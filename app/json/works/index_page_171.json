After experiencing nightmares that provide insight into a serial killer&#8217;s movements, Jennifer&#8217;s talent for communicating with insects links her to bug specialist Dr McGregor, with whom she aims to unmask the murderer. Engaging in the tropes of the genre - and using his trademark gore and gross-out aesthetics - Argento provides an array of thrills, scares and narrative twists all backed by a rock soundtrack.

Rachael travels the Victorian countryside in her Kombi and describes her camping trips as &#8216;more comfortable than being at home&#8217;. David, a Kombi enthusiast for over 30 years, is fascinated by the van&#8217;s early beginnings as an economical utilities vehicle in occupied Germany during World War II. Some tell of their love of the Kombi&#8217;s idiosyncratic design, &#8216;I love the box shape because it&#8217;s such a practical thing to put things in&#8217;. Andrew lovingly restores Kombis and believes &#8216;once you&#8217;re bitten by it, it never really goes away, once you own one you really wouldn&#8217;t want to own any other sort of car&#8217;. And Jan has learned to love Kombis again after her former partner smashed her newly restored Kombi to pieces with a wood splitter.

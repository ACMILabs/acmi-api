Steve Hennnessey is dead and Peter Faithful and his men in the Tactical Response Squad, particularly Danny (Steve Vidler), are now under investigation by the Homicide Squad. Matters become further complicated when new evidence is brought to light implicating both Peter and Danny not following police procedures at the scene of the crime. Extra pressure is also put on Danny when he takes the stand as an informant for a 2 year-old assault case which Tina Bertrum (Tracy Mann) is prosecuting. &#8220;Intent to permanently deprive&#8221; (49 mins) (directed by Julian McSwiney). Shirl Hennessey is charged with shop-lifting and in possession of a lighter-pistol and appears to want to go down for the crime, much to the bewilderment of Michael Kidd, her Defence Counsellor. Vic Manoulis finds himself involved with a disturbing child abuse murder case. Contains some scenes in b&amp;w. Cast also includes Chris Haywood, Simon Westaway, Jeremy Kewley, Louise Siversen, Paulene Terry-Beitz, Robert Wallace, John Arnold and Frank Gallacher.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:42:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Courtroom films and programs", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Conduct of court proceedings", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal investigation", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal justice, Administration of", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal law", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Criminal procedure", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Shoplifting", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials (Assault and battery) - Drama", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Trials (Murder) - Drama", "Drama", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1817039, "name": "Bill Hughes", "creator_id": 22134, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1548132, "name": "Julian McSwiney", "creator_id": 79594, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1548131, "name": "Kate Woods", "creator_id": 63244, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1548129, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1548128, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115584, "acmi_id": "S01423", "title": "Janus", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "janus", "creator_credit": "Bill Hughes and Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 91635, "acmi_id": "314778", "title": "Janus.

The case being handled is a horse ring-in trial and the star witness, an 8 year-old boy. Steve Hennessey is still missing and Peter Faithful offers to do a deal with Kenny Hardy (being held for the armed bank robbery) in exchange for information leading to Steve&#8217;s whereabouts. &#8220;A Familiar utterance&#8221; (50 mins) (directed by Michael Carson). The irony of it all - Michael Kidd, the Hennessey&#8217;s barrister, is asked to defend two police (formerly of the Drug Squad) who have been charged with assaulting a bouncer in a night club. Rob Griffin, following a tip off from Prosecutor Clyde Martin, links up with Peter Faithful in tracking down a brief of a 10 year old unsolved murder of Patrick Clancy, best mate of Mal Hennessey. Contains some scenes in b&amp;w.

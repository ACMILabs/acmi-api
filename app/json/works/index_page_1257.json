In the Carne canon, &#8216;Hotel du Nord&#8217; is usually eclipsed by &#8216;Le Quai des Brumes&#8217;, &#8216;Le jour se leve&#8217; (1939) and &#8216;Les Enfants du Paradis&#8217;<em> (1945), largely because of Prevert&#8217;s absence.

But in the interaction of set, camerawork and Maurice Jaubert&#8217;s restrained, moody music, &#8216;Hotel du Nord&#8217; is typical of poetic realism. Its poetry is embodied in the superb set designed by Alexandre Trauner, a replica of one side of the Canal Saint-Martin, complete with bridges, punctuated by location shots of the canal and barges.

Graham Greene, who loved French cinema for knowing &#8216;the immense importance of the careful accessory&#8217;, once wrote, &#8220;in Hotel du Nord we believe in desperate lovers and the suicide pact on the brass bed in the shabby room, just because of the bicyclists on the quay, the pimp quarrelling with his woman in another room, and the First Communion party.&#8221;     Social events such as strikes are a faint echo, as is the international situation (a young Spanish refugee is marginal to the story). Carne was more daring on the gender front. Characters may take the hackneyed appearance of pimps and prostitutes, but they are free of conventional morality. Edmond and Renee&#8217;s brief interlude is clearly sexual. When it is over (and although Edmond is smitten), they both shrug it off without guilt.

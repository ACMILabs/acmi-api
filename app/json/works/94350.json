This entertaining documentary spends time with people who are passionate about chickens. In Harpswell, Maine, a woman has 16 chickens, each with their own unique personality. There&#8217;s a recreation of a tense day in which chicken number 7 got lost out in the cold, froze, almost died, but was brought back to life by her owner.

Footage is also presented of battery hens and an egg hatchery, the scenes passed over without comment, just text on the screen, stark statistics quantifying the actions depicted.

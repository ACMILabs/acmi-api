Many major historical moments have been captured and provide an insight to the reasons as to how and why the Cold War, the Iron Curtain, East and West, and nuclear weapons became a part of our everyday life, particularly in the 1950s-1960s. Volume one features the first four episodes, covering the period from the Russian Revolution to the breaking of the Berlin blockade in 1949. Once allies against Hitler during World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States became divided over their political and economical ideologies post Nazi Germany with the US pushing for democracy and capitalism and the Soviet favouring expansionism and communism. As Central and Eastern Europe came under the control of Stalin and his puppet governments and the &#8220;Iron Curtain&#8221; was created, Germany and in particular, Berlin (divided into four occupied zones - US, British, Russian and French) became the focus of attention in the battle for ideological control. Berlin was blockaded and threatened with starvation by Stalin - the West&#8217;s response was the Berlin airlift. Meanwhile, to keep up with America&#8217;s nuclear capabilities the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb on 29 August 1949. The American monopoly was over and so began the rise of the Super Powers and decades of confrontation. Narrated by Kenneth Branagh.

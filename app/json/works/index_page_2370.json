The dance he performs illustrates the manner in which various highly stylised movements, known as dance phrases, express what might be put into words to form a phrase; it is from such a movement that the film takes it name; the dance performed by Ram Gopal is in the tradition of south-eastern India. The second dance, performed by Shevanti, is typical of the dances of the north-east of India. It doesn&#8217;t tell a story, as Gopal&#8217;s dance does, but simply invokes and expresses a mood. The third dance by Rajeshwar is an example of the Kathakali or dance-drama of southern India and tells the story of bees and the lotus flower, entirely in terms of movement of his face and hands.

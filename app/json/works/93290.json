Despite living with his dismissive and draconian father, Jan senses the tide has turned when he falls for a student he is tutoring. But alas it is not to be - his romantic life is marred by accidental involvement in student fascist politics and he is harassed continuously when mistaken for a Jew.

Jan&#8217;s failure at adaptation, in a rapidly changing world, leads to increasing alienation from his fellow man and a continuous lament at his fate or &#8216;bad luck&#8217; that dogs him.

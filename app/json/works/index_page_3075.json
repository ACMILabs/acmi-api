Since the mid-1980s, the Chinese film industry went through a series of structural transformations aimed at marketization. In 1984, film was redefined to be an integral part of cultural industries instead of political institutions for the enforcement of Communist ideology. As a result, film studios began to produce more market-oriented films. This martial arts film reflected such a trend. This film combines elements of different genres such as martial arts and suspense.

The &#8216;Scooby gang&#8217; are all in the throes of relationship hell. Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara&#8217;s (Amber Benson) love for each other begins to erode as Willow falls deeper into the black arts (addiction metaphors abound in this season), while Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Anya (Emma Caulfield) experience pre-wedding jitters with catastrophic consequences (Hell&#8217;s bells Eps. 116). Not to mention the fact that Buffy, the vampire slayer, starts this season dead and buried (Bargaining 1&amp;2 Eps. 101 &amp; 102). Considering how downbeat this season is, surprisingly it&#8217;s the one with the most light and comical villains, the nerdy three, Jonathan, Andrew and Warren (Flooded Eps. 104) - not to mention that they are mere mortals.

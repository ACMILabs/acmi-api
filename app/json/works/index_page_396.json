"<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters. Also, the very picturesque bridge is the only identified concrete arch bridge dressed with stone remaining in service in Queensland.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 titles &#8216;A Walkabout Film&#8217;, &#8216;Where Brolgas Dance&#8217;, &#8216;Filmed by WHC&#8217;<br />\n00:00:27:00 the &#8216;Air Cloud&#8217; tour boat moored at a pier<br />\n00:00:32:00 looking out from the pier over a lake or river followed by boats sitting on sand and mud when the tide is out and remains of old jettys<br />\n00:01:03:00 views of boats moored at jettys and piers<br />\n00:02:09:00 sunflowers in the foreground of mountains<br />\n00:02:27:00 the &#8216;Burdekin Bridge&#8217; rail and car bridge in Queensland<br />\n00:03:38:00 sugar cane, wetlands and lily pads and roaming cattle<br />\n00:04:13:00 a large spider web in the wetlands complete with black spider in the middle<br />\n00:04:30:00 driving through Townsville in Queensland, and past the &#8216;T&amp;G Building&#8217;<br />\n00:06:13:00 views of brolgas standing in grass and flying overhead<br />\n00:07:52:00 signs for &#8216;Mt Spec National Park&#8217; and &#8216;Little Crystal Creek&#8217;<br />\n00:07:59:00 views of the Little Crystal Creek Bridge and the creek itself with its lovely rocky banks<br />\n00:08:24:00 a roadside picnic and exploring under the bridge<br />\n00:08:54:00 sign for &#8216;McClelland Bridge&#8217; followed by scenic views of mountains and waterways<br />\n00:10:06:00 driving through the rainforest<br />\n00:10:48:00 views of the dramatic Wallaman Falls<br />\n00:11:01:00 sign for the Falls with facts and information for campers<br />\n00:11:34:00 sightseers at a lookout<br />\n00:12:03:00 a small modest road bridge<br />\n00:12:16:00 title &#8216;The End&#8217;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 29]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, c. 1970s</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters. Also, the very picturesque bridge is the only identified concrete arch bridge dressed with stone remaining in service in Queensland.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected

the 1990s.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good.

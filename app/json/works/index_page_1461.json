The general manager, Tian Geng learned the opinions of the staff and went to Beijing with the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Zhong Tianwen to report to the State Council. Tian Geng promised to turn in an annual profit of 50 million yuan, if the State Council would approve his reform plans based on the contractual agreement. Tian Geng’s proposal was approved, but his decision to appoint Lan Yumeng as the deputy manager was opposed by the Party Secretary, because Lan had an affair with an engineer, Feng Lu. Tian Geng tried to persuade Feng Lu to stay away from Lan but in vain. Tian Geng devoted himself wholeheartedly to his work and neglected his family. Burdened with the pressure of work and family, Tian Geng had to finance 800 million yuan for the second phase of a project. Tian Geng overrode all objections and made a difficult decision to borrow the money from an international bank. Lan Yumeng was finally appointed the general director for the project and was together with Feng Lu. The project went well and Tian Geng felt that he had owed his family, colleagues and friends too much because of work.</p>\n<p>This is a very important film to understand China’s state-owned enterprise reform in the early 1980s. The film is based on the reform of the Sichuan Panzhihua Steel Company. It was the winner of the Best Film at the 12th Hundred Flowers Film Festival in 1989. Guangxi Film Studio was established in 1958, and some of the more well-known movies produced by the film studio include the Fifth Generation’s groundbreaking film, Yellow Earth (dir. Chen Kaige, 1985) and Not One Less (dir. Zhang Yimou, 1999). The film provides insights into the challenges of China’s state-owned enterprise reform in its early stage and has a positive tone. Now three decades after Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping launched the economic reform, Chinese society has undergone tremendous changes.

(4 stars - James Donald; December 15, 2010)</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Anran is a little girl with many questions: &#8220;Why are cars so fast?&#8221;, &#8220;Why are ants so small?&#8221;, &#8220;Why do planes fly in the sky?&#8221;<br />\nAs she develops into a young lady, Anran&#8217;s curiosity grows into a thirst for knowledge. An independent and confident spirit, she is considered by friends and family to be different from normal girls, and she often cannot help expressing the greatest contempt for the ignorant with a sharp tongue and keen sense of cheek. Anran has a strong relationship with her older sister Anjing, who tries in vein to avoid the inconvenient truths and uncomfortable facets within their society. While attempting to protect her younger sister, Anjing is torn between her own reality and the voracious curiosity of Anran.<br />\nWhile Anjing is often distressed by Anran&#8217;s apparent inability to let sleeping dogs lie, Anran tackles complex problems of individuality, integrity and love. Her own moral and philosophical journey is launched from the question of &#8220;why the beautiful would care for the ugly?&#8221; It is not long before Anran crosses a social boundary with serious consequences.<br />\nCausing her teacher to lose face before the entire class by correcting a mispronounced word, what may otherwise have ended as a minor affair erupts into an open confrontation between student and teacher. The inevitable conclusion unfolds, with Anran&#8217;s fellow students turning on her, isolating her in an attempt to humiliate her into conforming. However this has the opposite effect, and Anran is gradually propelled by a sense of disgust by what she sees as the spineless herd mentality of her peers to even more brazen and heated confrontations.<br />\nDespite her relentless nature, Anran is depicted as a tender-hearted young girl with a powerful bond with her parents, wearing only the bright red dress given to her by her sister and desperate to stop Anjing from marrying abroad. Anran becomes gradually more wilful, and frightens the appeasing nature of her mother and older sister until they too try to silence her. Anran cannot understand how they would not stand up to fight until discovering her mother&#8217;s poetry, which she wrote as a passionate young woman. The words reflect Anran&#8217;s own struggle, and she understands through her own distress for herself and others why people conform to avoid harm coming to those they love.<br />\nIn an attempt to settle the student-teacher dispute, Anjing visits the Anran&#8217;s teacher. It turns out they are old classmates themselves, and Anjing gives her the &#8220;present&#8221; of tickets to a concert to secure Anran&#8217;s safety, as well as her election in the upcoming vote for the highly coveted position of class captain. The culture of invisible fears engendered in society where &#8220;face&#8221; and &#8220;respectability&#8221; and &#8220;results&#8221; &#8220;grades&#8221; are of prime importance.<br />\nDespite receiving what at face value appears to be a great honor and redemption in the eyes of her peers, Anran immediately recognises foul play. Instead of playing her part, she confronts the teacher over being elected. At first the teacher insists &#8220;You think too much about it&#8221;, but realises Anran is earnest in her,  &#8220;It&#8217;s not my thinking, but what I see with my eyes.&#8221; This also leads Anjing to finally understand Anran isn&#8217;t simply trying to be smart, but that she has a sense of morality and justice that has outgrown the society she lives in.<br />\nThe film ends on an uncertain footing, with Anjing preparing to leave forever, and Anran now fully aware of the difficulties she will face if she continues to follow her individualistic moral standards.</p>\n<p>The economy of the city is thriving under Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s newly introduced hybrid of capitalist-socialism, the two girls live out their own personal carefree fantasies; shopping, taking walks in the park, wearing pretty dresses and talking liberally about their feelings.

Gao was forced to return to the countryside to earn a living with his parents as lowly peasant farmers and this abrupt fall down the social ladder plagued him every day.

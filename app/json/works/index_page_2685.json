Fascinated by the role technology played in transforming our lives, McLuhan predicted, with stunning accuracy, the impact the digital age would have on our social, spiritual, economic and ideological selves.

He also pioneered the idea of inter-disciplinary and media studies within the university, heading the newly opened Center for Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto in 1967.

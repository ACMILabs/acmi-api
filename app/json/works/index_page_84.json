The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a group trip by tourist bus, four wheel drive vehicles and truck around the &#8216;Gulf Country&#8217;.  The Gulf Country is the region of woodland and savanna grassland surrounding the Gulf of Carpentaria in north western Queensland and parts of the Northern Territory, Australia.</p>\n<p>We see many dirt roads and sandy tracks so that we see both a tourist bus and four wheel drive vehicles being dug out of the sand. As always, Wallace includes close-ups of any flora and fauna that catch<br />\nhis eye along the way.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:03:00

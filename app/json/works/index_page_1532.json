During the first season creator Chris Carter guides us through a labyrinth of secret plots, covert organizations within organizations, and insidious extraterrestrial conspiracy theories.

Davis). Part of the show&#8217;s popularity is due to the unusual relationship between Scully and Mulder. Carter presents a platonic relationship between a man and a woman with all its subtle shifts and changes without having to resort to the standard resolution of romance and sex. Actors Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are key to the shows success, creating genuine chemistry and a subtle sexual tension between them.

In his quest, D faces many nasty encounters with murderous semi-human creatures, including a werewolf, a shape-shifter, a phantom queen, and a subculture of human-hating monsters. In Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&#8221;, the sequel to &#8220;Vampire hunter D (1985), the future has the aesthetic of a dystopic, medieval nightmare but the animation is far more sophisticated than in the original. Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Wicked City, Animatrix) keeps the action exciting, even if the characterisations are simplistic, and the violent gory animatronics are awe-inspiring in scope, embodying all the qualities of gothic, bloody combat, whilst harking to the model of the eternal outsider, moody and disliked, shunned by society and feared by his enemies.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture sequels", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - Japan", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Kidnapping", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Violence", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Revenge", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Violence", "History&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Japanese literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Mythology", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Fantasy", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Monsters", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Motion picture sequels"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1999147, "name": "Yoshiaki Kawajiri", "creator_id": 27550, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999146, "name": "Taka Nagasawa", "creator_id": 80729, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999145, "name": "Masao Maruyama", "creator_id": 79264, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999144, "name": "Mata Yamamoto", "creator_id": 80506, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999143, "name": "Film Line International", "creator_id": 36225, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1999142, "name": "Urban Vision Entertainment", "creator_id": 36224, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1999141, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52196", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33811], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94302, "acmi_id": "318116", "title": "The Devil's backbone = El Espinazo del diablo", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-devils-backbone-el-espinazo-del-diablo-dvd", "creator_credit": "Guillermo del Toro, Pedro Almodovar, Tequila Gang and El Deseo S.

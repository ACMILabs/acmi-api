It is mostly dominated by singing opera arias with minimal make-up, costuming and acting and performed at traditional Tea-houses. The documentary includes behind-the-scenes and backstage operations and negotiations as the local Henan TV Station prepare a live-to-air performance of their Art Troupe featuring Lu Ronghua and Zhao Feng. It also follows Lu and Zhao&#8217;s bid to establish their own Teahouse - their financial problems, legal negotiations and the long and frustrating bureaucratical system that keeps on hindering them from achieving their ambition of bringing traditional Chinese culture to the masses.

Leslie Chase (Robert Patrick), a ruthless and determined property developer working on a construction project in Santa Del Soz, Mexico, is fed up with the local Totec Indians harassing him and after two of his workers are murdered, Chase has the whole tribe of Indians massacred. Unfortunately for Chase, one of the Indians survives to make a surprise attack on him, biting him on the neck. Chase kills him but not before the Indian has time to expel his last gasp. Six years later in Boone County, Pennsylvania, Chase, still the same arrogant avaricious property developer by day, is cursed by the sacrificial spirit of the tribe in his body by night, filling him with the need to kill, and keep killing. His series of murders eventually lead to suspicion and an investigation by a woman, Nora Weeks (Joanna Pacula), whose husband has gone missing.

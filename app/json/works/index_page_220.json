The collection was donated to ACMI by Michaelis&#8217;s daughter, Sally Cohen, and her husband Sheldon Cohen. The films show life in Melbourne including the 1956 Olympic Games, a fishing trip to Bermagui in NSW, and holidays in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This film is titled&#8217; Eastern Tour 1939&#8217; and begins with footage of a passenger liner departing from Sydney Harbour farewelled by waving onlookers and streamers. We see Sydney Harbour and images of the Whitsundays along the way. The highlight of this film is the footage of Bali in 1939. We see Balinese people in a traditional canoe, juking or cadik, paddle alongside the ship as it arrives in Bali. Once on land, there are images of temples, rice terraces, farmers, and a Balinese market with traders plying their trade. There are local people buying food from the stallholders and busying themselves around the market and socialising. We witness a Balinese wedding ceremony and a Gamelan orchestra accompanying a performance of the Legong Dance.

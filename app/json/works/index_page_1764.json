Ted’s films feature life in and around the Victorian regional city of Wangaratta post-war. This was a period of prosperity and optimism largely due to a successful textile industry that took Wangaratta from a small country town to major rural city, declared in 1959.</p>\n<p>Ted captures the many sporting and social events, venues and clubs, holidays and travel along with scenes of everyday life. The collection also shows the broader issues faced by country people such as the regular flooding events around the Ovens and King Rivers.</p>\n<p>Wangaratta’s success story as a manufacturing town traces the path of post-war migration and the accompanying growth of Australia’s economy, which makes these films particularly interesting.</p>\n<p>The Ted Parsons Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker’s grandson Barry Parsons. The films have been made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures some travels around Victoria. The Parsons take a trip from Wangaratta to Beechworth, down through Mount Buffalo to San Remo and Phillip Island on the south coast, and back up through the Dandenong Ranges and Healesville.</p>\n<p>The film shows scenes of life in country towns of Victoria, including sporting and recreational events, the flooding of Ovens River, some beautiful footage of Phillip Island, the Australian Alps in autumn, and the Tesselaar Tulip Festival in Healesville.</p>\n<p>The Parsons&#8217; travels also take them to the Hume Dam, formerly known as the Hume Weir, which was a popular tourist destination during the 1940s and 50s.</p>\n<p>A feature of the film is the flooded roads and paddocks of Wangaratta during the 1956 floods, which stemmed from major flooding in the Murray River.</p>\n<p>Ted films road signs to indicate each stop on their travels.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 road sign &#8216;Wangaratta Please Slow Down&#8217;<br />\n00:00:13:00 the Wangaratta Flour Mills building<br />\n00:00:20:00 the Wangaratta Woollen Mills<br />\n00:00:28:00 swimmers - mostly children - at a water hole or river, and diving off a metal tower<br />\n00:01:00:00 a great example of a house with blinds against summer heat and 1950s style car<br />\n00:01:15:00 views of gladioli and daisies<br />\n00:03:30:00 grasshoppers swarming on the bowls club lawn<br />\n00:04:06:00 a man and woman walk with children and an old fashioned baby&#8217;s pram followed by children playing in a park playground<br />\n00:04:40:00 sign &#8216;Ovens River&#8217;

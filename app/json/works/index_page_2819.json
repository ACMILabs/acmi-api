She begins an affair with him, and is debilitated by the ensuing desire and love that consumes them while they&#8217;re together. Emilio accompanies Diane to Prague where she threatens to ruin her professional reputation by putting her desires before work. Diane&#8217;s affair is blatantly obvious to her husband, Phillipe (Patrick Chesnais), however he tacitly lets the affair continue in the hope that it will soon end. When he is employed as the defence lawyer for Madame Dupleche who has been charged with murdering an abusive, unfaithful husband, it causes him, as well as Diane, to question the situation they find themselves in and to discover what makes them happy. Cast includes Boris Terral, Nils Tavernier and Patrick Chesnais.

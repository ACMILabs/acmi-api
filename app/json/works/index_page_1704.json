It was donated to ACMI by Daryl Annett.</p>\n<p>This film is a snap shot of suburban life in Melbourne. There are wonderful examples of fashion, inner-Melbourne street scenes, architecture and cars of the time. We see a children’s birthday party and backyard games under the Hills Hoist as well as neighbours chatting over the fence to passers-by in the street. Men in Australian Army and Air Force uniforms pose and smile for the camera, and there are scenes of a road trip to regional Victoria. We see a fire truck display, horse and harness riding as well as woodchopping displays at the Royal Melbourne Show. There are candid images of a horse event competitor in the stables area of the Royal Melbourne Show, as well as St Kilda Road buses and trams as they travel down the road. Black and white images of a horse and cart and a man in a bowler hat performing tricks is a fantastic moment in time.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list (timecodes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:00:03:00 Close-up of men’s faces as they walk past the camera, waving their hats and gesturing.

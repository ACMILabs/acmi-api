"description": "<p>An army of First Nations warriors come out to play in this latest action-packed video by Kamilaroi artist Reko Rennie.</p>\n<p>An all-Indigenous crew of martial arts students train together in their dojo; learning teachings of discipline, self-defense and teamwork. When the Sensei cries, “What do we want?” the students respond, “Restitution! Land back! Equality! No more cops killing our mob!”, vocalising demands of environmental, political and social concern, and reflecting the broad diversity within contemporary Indigenous urban society.</p>\n<p>Rennie was taught martial arts by his father while growing up in Melbourne’s inner West. <i>What Do We Want?</i> marries his 25-year history of martial arts and his arts practice, while expanding Rennie’s evolving moving image repertoire into the realm of performance.</p>\n<p><i>What Do We Want?</i> takes influence from martial arts films including Blaxploitation films of the 1970s and 80s; utilising the medium to make a statement about authenticity, respect, bravery and collective power. The students in <i>What Do We Want?</i> become a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>Displayed in the gallery in a massive three-channel video installation, the work loudly and proudly conveys the diversity of First Nations peoples, and the ongoing fight for justice that unifies them, raising urgent questions that require action and response.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Director: Reko Rennie</p>\n<p>Produced by Film Camp, Philippa Campey, Molly O&#8217;Connor</p>\n<p>Original composition by A.B.

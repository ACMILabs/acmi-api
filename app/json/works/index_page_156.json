However, &#8220;A Moment of Innocence&#8221; is much more than a study in political perspective. As the two older men recruit young actors to play themselves on film, they must deal with both cinema&#8217;s ability to romanticise and falsify history, as well as having to explain to a younger generation the complicated history of Iran prior to the 1979 revolution. As the young actors struggle to understand the hatreds of the past, they also force the older men to understand their own mistakes and their own prejudices. This remarkable film, beautifully shot in the middle of a Teheran winter, is a celebration of the humanist impulse in history and also a remarkably optimistic celebration of young people which puts much of Hollywood&#8217;s cynical exploitation of youth to shame.

Twenty years later the policeman he wounded ended up auditioning for a role in one of his films. From that bizarre coincidence Makhmalbaf developed a script in which both the policeman and the activist have a chance to tell each side of their story on film.

The unfolding dream within a dream narrative follows the perils and follies of an overworked film crew trying to get the perfect scene down on the set of a low-budget movie. Technical hiccups and budget restrictions aside, the motley group of crew members have to contend with an egotistical film star (James LeGros), a neurotic actress (Catherine Keener), their stressed out director (Steve Buscemi), his sensitive cinematographer (Dermot Mulroney), and a pissed off midget (Peter Dinklage). Clashing ego&#8217;s aside, &#8216;Living in oblivion&#8217; is ultimately an affectionate tribute to the agony and ecstasy of making films and the resilient spirit of the independent film maker. Cast includes Danielle von Zerneck, Rica Martens, Kevin Corrigan, Hilary Gilford, Mathew Grace, Michael Griffiths.

"<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters.

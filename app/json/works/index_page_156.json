It is also a film that revels in ritual - dance, dressing, and undressing, nursing, bullfighting - many elements of the narrative are drawn from a sense of rite and ceremony in everyday life. A lyrical and compassionate film, &#8220;Talk to her&#8221; has traces of Almodovar&#8217;s surrealist past, with a splendid six-minute silent film, an interlude that celebrates man&#8217;s devotion to woman.

In the Jewish Seeling family, Mum and Dad struggle to come to terms with their gay daughter, who has brought her girlfriend home for the holiday. Heading a traditional African-American family, Ronald works for a racist senator, whilst his visiting mother mercilessly criticises her daughter-in-law&#8217;s every move. Having fled Vietnam the Nguyens live in LA as an extended family, where the teenage children encounter difficulties with assimilation. Lastly, the Avila family celebrate their Latino roots, whilst feeling conflicted by the absence of their ostracised father. A common thread that runs through the film is tolerance and the difficulties inherent in accepting diversity - particularly in relation to the offspring&#8217;s choice of partners. Despite this interesting premise, Chadha cannot avoid entertaining a slew of cliches in order to fill the gaps dictated by such a large tapestry. This works against achieving a sense of realism - and many narrative threads wrap up tritely. Nevertheless the film retains a certain charm and it is refreshing to see Americans portrayed that are not white Anglo Saxon. There is the additional pleasure of watching the gastronomic diversity of numerous cultures on display.

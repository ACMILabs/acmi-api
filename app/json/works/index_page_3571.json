The script, by Ichiro Ryu, contains a youthful exuberance and a sadistically comic edge partnered with gruesome surreal murders and raw depictions of sex and drugs. Whilst the narrative features portraits of the many subcultures competing for space in the Japanese underworld, Miike favours broad depictions of character over complex profiles. But perhaps the reasons for engaging in Miike&#8217;s stylistic excesses has more to do with aesthetics in any case, as he utilises slow-motion photography and contrasts it with rapid editing to reflect the shifting, amoral gangster landscape where his protagonists roam. Cast includes: Riki Takeuchi, Sho Aikawa, Renji Ishibashi, Hirotaro Honda, Susumu Terajima and Tomoroh Taguchi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Action films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Gangster films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Crime", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Drug traffic", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Yakuza-eiga", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Narcotics", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 916205, "name": "Daiei Motion Picture Company", "creator_id": 25324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916206, "name": "Toei Animation", "creator_id": 66137, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916207, "name": "Kimura Toshiki", "creator_id": 80911, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916208, "name": "Makoto Okada", "creator_id": 80907, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916209, "name": "Ono Katsumi", "creator_id": 80912, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 916210, "name": "Takashi Miike", "creator_id": 36668, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52615", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2000", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2000"}], "labels": [34116]}, {"id": 92632, "acmi_id": "315938", "title": "Dead men don't wear plaid [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dead-men-dont-wear-plaid-dvd", "creator_credit": "Universal Pictures, Aspen Film Society, William McEuen, David V.

Simon wrote the music and songs for this film which forms a musical counterpart to the narrative. As much as it is about music and performance, the film is also an examination of what happened to the ideals and hopes of the hippie generation once it aged. Cast also includes Rip Torn, Joan Hackett and Lou Reed and features cameo appearances by Tiny Tim, soul legends Sam and Dave, the Lovin&#8217; Spoonful and the B-52s.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:38:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Responsibility", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ B 52's (Musical group)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Rock music", "Musicals", "People&nbsp;→ B 52's (Musical group)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/one-trick-pony", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 958433, "name": "Warner Bros Pictures", "creator_id": 71994, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958434, "name": "Michael Hausman", "creator_id": 21896, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958435, "name": "Michael Tannen", "creator_id": 79189, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 958436, "name": "Robert Young", "creator_id": 12987, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46718", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1980", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1980"}], "labels": [29086], "external_references": [{"id": 5060, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "42157"}]}, {"id": 108670, "acmi_id": "B1003986", "title": "One too many mornings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "one-too-many-mornings", "creator_credit": "Daniel Fotheringham", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "VIC/Australia, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>In our circular existence we search for something new.

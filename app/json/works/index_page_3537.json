The action takes place in what appears to be an experiment in human survival as a select group of people wake up contained within the walls of a cube, twenty-six identical rooms wide and twenty-six high. How they got there is not made clear but finding their way out is the whole premise of the film. The skill-sets of this particular group of people aid or hinder their survival - for example, an old thief works out a way to find out if a room is booby-trapped or not - and survival is at stake because the cube kills and this is shown in scenes of visceral gore.

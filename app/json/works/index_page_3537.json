Pursued by malevolent bounty hunters, and badly wounded, Blake is accompanied on his hallucinatory journey by Nobody - an Eastern educated Indian who believes his new friend is the dead British poet and mystic William Blake. Gradually, Blake comes to fulfil his designated role as the most wanted man in this corner of the west, all the while preparing for life&#8217;s ultimate journey aided by Native American spiritualism. Accompanied by the haunting music of Neil Young and filmed in tunning black and white by cinematographer Robby Muller, &#8216;Dead Man&#8217; is a lyrical film that acts as mordant comment  upon American life.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Demetra J.

Told in the form of flashback, the film begins with an elderly Oharu praying before Buddha, reflecting on her life, and her first love. Years ago the well respected Oharu fell in love with a samurai (played by a young Toshiro Mifune), only to lose favour with her family who are exiled for her actions, as well as her love who is promptly beheaded. Her father forces her to become mistress of a great lord in order to bear him an heir, which she does, but is abandoned by the prince after she gives birth. Outcast by the prince, Oharu slides to the lowest rank in society and is forced into becoming a prostitute and beggar. Her life is populated by love and servitude to the men she encounters, as well as the knowledge that her royal son is the one chance she has at escaping her life of poverty and humiliation. The sufferings of the beautiful Oharu (Kinuyo Tanaka) are observed without sentimentality or moralising by Mizoguchi who is acknowledged as being a lifelong advocate of equitable treatment for Japanese women. In Japanese with English subtitles. Cast also includes Ichiro Sugai, Toshiro Yanane and Ataro Shindo.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>The Life of Oharu = Saikaku ichidai onna</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Kenji Mizoguchi, Hideo Koi, Koi and Shintoho Eiga</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Japan, 1952</p>", "description": "<p>&#8216;The Life of Oharu&#8217; is an adaptation of Saikaku&#8217;s classic novel which traces the tragic riches to rags life of a Japanese woman in 17th century Japan.

Loosely based on Dostoevsky&#8217;s &#8216;Crime and Punishment&#8217;, Bresson&#8217;s intense portrait of a compulsive pickpocket who believes himself above the moral constraints of common humanity turns the mechanics of theft into a ritual both erotically and spiritually charged. The &#8216;ballets of thievery&#8217;,  as Cocteau called them, are among the most beautifully choreographed and edited sequences in cinema. &#8216;A film of dazzling originality. On its first viewing, it risks burning your eyes. So, do like me: Go back to see it again every day &#8230; If you deny this film, it is cinema itself as an autonomous art that you call into question&#8217; (Louis Malle).&#8221; Reference: James Quandt.

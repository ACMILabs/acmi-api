captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, the Nixon family are living in Alice Springs in 1966, until we see them returning to Victoria via a TAA flight.

"brief_description": "<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings. Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film Les and Dorothy Nixon show off their first baby Karen (who features in the Nixon Collection until she is an adult herself) at their home in Herne Hill, Geelong, Victoria. There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking. As well as these usual baby activities we see them in the context of the 1960s - style of clothes, carseat, bassinette, pram and playpen.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:25:00 infant Karen being carried around the family backyard by teenage girls, (possibly cousins in the large extended Corry-Nixon family)<br />\n00:01:02:00 family members climb a rock formation, followed by views of surrounding scenery<br />\n00:01:15:00 scenes of baby Karen’s christening or baptism day (assumed by the style of baby clothes and blanket and by Dorothy’s smart outfit which includes matching hat, gloves and necklace)<br />\n00:01:37:00 baby Karen being held by her grandmother and great aunt<br />\n00:01:47:00 baby Karen with father Len<br />\n00:02:19:00 baby Karen laughing in her bassinette<br />\n00:02:30:00 a family gathering for a beach picnic<br />\n00:04:11:00 extended family members gather for a photo with baby Karen<br />\n00:05:45:00 baby Karen being fed from a bowl, while she sits in her bassinette on the back porch of the home followed by a bath<br />\n00:06:54:00 a ‘dummy’ (pacifier or soother) hanging from above the bassinette<br />\n00:07:11:00 extended family members gather in front of one of their homes for a group scene; one of the women flits across the screen playfully swinging her skirt for the camera<br />\n00:08:00:00 baby Karen with Dorothy<br />\n00:08:57:00 a Holden model car from the era<br />\n00:10:20:00 baby Karen’s new car seat<br />\n00:11:21:00 an older baby Karen with a cousin in the backyard<br />\n00:12:09:00 a very 1960s style wedding<br />\n00:12:12:00 baby Karen chases an empty cigarette pack across the carpet floor, practising her crawling<br />\n00:13:57:00 baby Karen in her pram<br />\n00:14:46:00 Les mowing the lawn<br />\n00:15:08:00 first steps for Karen, with dad<br />\n00:15:30:00 at the beach, splashing around in the sea with cousins<br />\n00:16:25:00 family members paddle boarding and surfing<br />\n00:17:38:00 Karen wearing a sunbonnet in a &#8216;playpen&#8217;<br />\n00:18:46:00 Karen playing and laughing with dad<br />\n00:19:17:00 a lovely little rowboat named &#8216;Sea Wyf&#8217;<br />\n00:20:14:00 Karen crawling and first steps<br />\n00:21:40:00 Karen &#8216;frosting&#8217; the window<br />\n00:21:56:00 a family picnic<br />\n00:24:01:00 women dressed in smart outfits including hats<br />\n00:24:09:00 1960s wedding in light blue<br />\n00:25:50:00 toddler Karen playing with bucket and spade at the beach<br />\n00:26:25:00 Karen and Les practise swimming with a board and family beach scenes<br />\n00:28:18:00 gladioli flowers in a vase, in the fashion of the day<br />\n00:30:43:00 public gardens</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Nixon Family Home Movies: Reel 1]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Dorothy Nixon and Les Nixon</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1963</p>", "description": "<p>In the Nixon Family Home Movie Collection, married film enthusiasts Les and Dorothy Nixon have captured their family life from when their children are very young to when they are young adults, at home in Geelong, during wonderful beach holidays at Point Roadknight on the Victorian coast, and when going about their everyday activities, from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>\n<p>The films show life in regional and suburban Victoria at the time: playing in the backyard and bike riding down the street (no helmets of course), lots of tennis, lots of beach and swimming, lots of family visits, birthday parties and family barbeques or picnic gatherings.

"<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park.

the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good. The sound drops out early in the film for several seconds and is a little hard to understand at times.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 titles &#8216;The Walkabouters&#8217;, &#8216;Werribee Gorge Nov 1972&#8217;<br />\n00:01:13:00 putting up camping tents<br />\n00:01:37:00 taking a break at a picnic table near a campfire, possibly drinking wine from wine flagons<br />\n00:01;53:00 cooking sausages on a barbeque iron plate over the open flames, sitting in 1970s style folding chairs<br />\n00:02:02:00 an old utility style truck with participants packed in the back as other participants set off walking<br />\n00:02:38:00 assisting each other as hikers are traversing a rocky creek and bending under the barbed wire of a farm fence while others hold wire up<br />\n00:03:51:00 using cameras and binoculars while listening to a guide or club member talking about the Gorge, followed by precarious crossing over water by using an old fallen tree<br />\n00:04:50:00 views around the landscape<br />\n00:06:05:00 hikers rest among the trees<br />\n00:08:10:00 views around the landscape and from a higher vantage point down to the river and tents<br />\n00:09:16:00 getting rock samples<br />\n00:09:50:00 views of the Werribee River and the rocky steep banks<br />\n00:10:15:00 views along the river, rocky outcrops and trickling waterfalls<br />\n00:11:09:00 preparing a meal back at base camp<br />\n00:12:12:00 eggs and bacon cooking on the open fire and a view of the tents<br />\n00:12:49:00 clambering over a farm gate<br />\n00:12:58:00 horses and cows<br />\n00:14:12:00 a colourful bug on a leaf<br />\n00:15:12:00 soaking tired feet in the creek<br />\n00:18:40:00 sign for &#8216;Blackwood Pottery&#8217; followed by the pottery studio<br />\n00:19:15:00 views around the studio and potters at their wheels<br />\n00:20:15:00 the pottery kiln<br />\n00:21:31:00 an old cement camp fireplace barbeque with billies boiling and meat cooking<br />\n00:21:49:00 serving the billy tea at a park picnic table<br />\n00:22:08:00 eating the barbequed chops in bread, sleeping under a tree and photographing the scenery<br />\n00:23:53:00 close-ups of wildflowers<br />\n00:25:17:00 outdoor eating back at the tents<br />\n00:25:26:00 canoeing down the river<br />\n00:26:09:00 title &#8216;The End&#8217;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 28]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film.

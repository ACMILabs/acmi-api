But as becomes clear in the cross-cutting between the various threads of the film, each individual displays both eccentricities and talents which enable them to transcend the limitations of social roles. Youki Kudoh and Mastoshi Nagase are excellent as a hip Japanese couple making a pilgrimage to Presley&#8217;s grave and the rest of the cast are also outstanding. Excellent cameos from Clash singer Joe Strummer and a very funny wild performance by blues veteran Screamin Jay Hawkins. Narrated by Tom Waits and featuring the music of John Lurie, Roy Orbinson, the Bar Kays and Rufus Thomas.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 30}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/mystery-train", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1987837, "name": "Jim Jarmusch", "creator_id": 24586, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987836, "name": "Jim Stark", "creator_id": 26183, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987835, "name": "MTI productions", "creator_id": 26182, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1987834, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Television", "creator_id": 26181, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40014", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [23565], "external_references": []}]}

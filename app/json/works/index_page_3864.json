An impressive cast includes Angelina Jolie, Rosanna Arquette, William Forsythe and Mekhi Phifer.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Gloria is from Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, a rough New York neighbourhood, and five years on is still grieving for her brother, killed during a botched robbery - an event she blames on his accomplice, Johnny.

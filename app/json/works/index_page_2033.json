Through Robert McFarlane, renowned photographer and critic, Moyle is given a chance to come out of the void and into the open - McFarlane wants to set up a solo exhibition of Moyle&#8217;s works. This is an uncompromising look at Peter Darren Moyle, his journey as he strives towards his first exhibition, his relationship to the environment and the people he shares his life with but it is also a social commentary of the times we live in. An extraordinary piece of work. Cinematography by Mark Bliss.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:26:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photographers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography", "Documentary", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Unemployment", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Alcoholism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drugs", "Places&nbsp;→ Sydney (N.S.W.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2185619, "name": "Sascha Ettinger-Epstein", "creator_id": 8925, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q24705830", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2185617, "name": "Renata Schuman", "creator_id": 8924, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034918", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2185625, "name": "Justin Malinowski", "creator_id": 73496, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2185624, "name": "Mark Bliss", "creator_id": 73495, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2185622, "name": "Marcus Cullozeou", "creator_id": 73494, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2185620, "name": "Sascha Ettinger-Epstein", "creator_id": 8925, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q24705830", "role": "screenwriter", "role_id": 601, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "SP Betacam; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2098", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [48344]}]}

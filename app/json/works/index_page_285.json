The film is a fascinating &#8216;slice-of-life&#8217; view of working class life in Britain of the 60s, whose entrancing black and white cinematography, reminiscent of Bill Brandt&#8217;s photography of working class England, contrasts with the gauche and drab reality of the characters&#8217; surrounds. This controversial film dealt with many taboo topics on the day - teen pregnancy, inter-racial romance, homosexuality, child abandonment, without excessive sermonising on the topics, typical of American moral dramas of the 1950s. Cast includes Dora Bryan, Rita Tushingham, Robert Stephens, Murray Melvin, Paul Danquah and David Boliver.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Working class in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Homosexuality in motion pictures", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Sexual behavior", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Adolescent", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Pregnancy, Unwanted", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenage pregnancy", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Women - Alcohol use", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-taste-of-honey", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963563, "name": "Bryanston Films", "creator_id": 23052, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963564, "name": "Continental", "creator_id": 26186, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963565, "name": "Woodfall Film Productions", "creator_id": 61992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963566, "name": "Tony Richardson", "creator_id": 62037, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52030", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1961", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1961"}], "labels": [33664], "external_references": [{"id": 3366, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "25062"}]}, {"id": 79532, "acmi_id": "300484", "title": "A Tale of Two Cities", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-tale-of-two-cities", "creator_credit": "David O.

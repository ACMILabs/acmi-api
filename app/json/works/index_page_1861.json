The plot centres around multi-millionaire Stephanie Harper (Rebecca Gilling), orphaned age 23 and inheriting her father&#8217;s mining fortune as well as the palatial estate, Eden. Two unsuccessful marriages later and dowdy Stephanie is about to walk down the aisle for the third time with smooth, gold-digging tennis champion, Greg Marsden (David Reyne).

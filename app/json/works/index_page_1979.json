Instead of the artists meeting at each location, they put everyone on a train that went from city to city. What a ride! This documentary is a re-discovery of the musical journey that took place and for some the great emotional journey from the vibe and friendship/good times that happened on the train. Never before had performers been so well looked after and the train became a place for one hell of party - Buddy Guy says at one point he tried to sleep but was worried he might miss something - one car was for blues jamming, one for folk, one for food and one for, well, other activities. The whole event ran at a great loss, word on the street was that the concerts should be free and youth of the day would charge the gates causing trouble at every town. That is why this footage was not uncovered for more that 30 years, no one had any money at the end of it to produce the film and it just sat in a vault! Some split-screen technique is used combining contemporary interviews with original footage or simply showing the two points-of-view of a two camera shot. Performers featured are: &#8220;The Band&#8221;, &#8220;Delaney and Bonnie&#8221;, &#8220;The Flying Burrito Brothers&#8221;, &#8220;Grateful Dead&#8221;, &#8220;Buddy Guy Blues Band&#8221;, &#8220;Ian &amp; Sylvia &amp; The Great Speckled Bird&#8221;, &#8220;Janis Joplin&#8221;, &#8220;Mashmakhan&#8221; and &#8220;Sha Na Na&#8221;. Cities visited include Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary (with a stop at a liquor store to re-stock!).

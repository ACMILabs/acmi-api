Keshishian follows Madonna on tour presenting her magnificently staged live shows (in colour) and her backstage and after hours shenanigans (in black and white). Madonna is depicted as a consummate performer dedicated to her art but whose identity and personhood are inextricably complicated by her infamy and the contemporary superstar obsession. Voice-over from Madonna provides insight into her perspective on fame, family, and creative expression. Interviews include Madonna&#8217;s brother, and her numerous dancers, some of whom discuss their ambitions and insecurities. When the camera turns to Warren Beatty (Madonna&#8217;s then boyfriend), he proves to be a prickly subject and questions the nature of the honesty of the documentary being made. This work was indeed criticised for it sanitation and artificiality due to the fact that the content was tightly controlled by Madonna. Despite that assertion, Keshishian&#8217;s lingering takes provide remarkable material that should prove appealing to those with an interest in contemporary culture, and extremely entertaining to music fans.

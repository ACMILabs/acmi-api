With a different identity and a face altered beyond recognition by plastic surgery, he is sent back to England in the guise of a Soviet citizen to retrieve a secret dossier of names he supposedly hid there several years ago. When he decides to defect a second time the viewer is drawn into a complex web of espionage, counter-espionage and counter-counter-espionage where nothing is as it at first appears.

The collection was donated to ACMI by Sheldon and Sally Cohen. The films show life in Melbourne including the 1956 Olympic Games, a fishing trip to Bermagui in NSW, and holidays in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This film depicts scenes of Bali and Java taken while on a holiday in 1939. The film is divided into sections indicated by titles: ‘Native Law Court –The Ceiling is Decorated with Pictures of Punishments’; ‘A Balinese Beauty’; ‘A Temple Birthday Festival – The Procession’; ‘A Temple Birthday Festival – at the Temple’; ‘Polishing Rice’; ‘Cockfighting is a Popular Past time’; ‘Java’; ‘Java – Selecta-A Hill station above Soerabaja’; ‘Java Semarang’; ‘The Borobudur’; ‘A Mohammedan Funeral at Djockjakarta’; ‘Buitenzorg – Government House and the Botanical Gardens’.</p>\n<p>This film is interesting for the Balinese and Javanese street, local transport and people scenes. Images of the architecture, temples, cultural traditions and ceremonies are also a highlight. The film shows pottery techniques and a pottery ware market. There is footage of a funeral procession and a traditional Balinese temple festival or Odalan. The film shows elaborate offerings of fruit and food which is brought with great ceremony by the locals to the temple. We see Borobudur and surrounds, including details of the temple walls and structure. Dutch spelling and place names, as well as images of the hill station resort Selecta, reflect Indonesia’s colonial history and provide context for the time in which the film was made.</p>\n<p>Selected Highlights List  (timecodes from Access Overscan)</p>\n<p>00:00:01:00 title: “Bali-Native Law Court– the Ceiling is Decorated with Pictures of Punishments”<br />\n00:00:16:00 images of the ceiling of what appears to be an outdoor law court depicting painted representations of Balinese punishments<br />\n00:00:40:00 women carrying baskets on their head walk down a palm-fringed dirt road<br />\n00:01:23:00 local woman works at a potter wheel making a bowl<br />\n00:01:46:00 local men walking down a road carrying a multitude of basket ware across their shoulders on their heads<br />\n00:01:54:00 pottery market<br />\n00:02:06:00 local woman tending to lotus flowers and garden;

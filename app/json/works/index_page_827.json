Far from accomplishing his task, Zhao Gou is taken hostage and held to ransom, shattering the last hopes of amnesty toward China&#8217;s devastated population. A Shaolin Kung Fu warrior Li Ma, known commonly as the &#8220;Flying Magic Mouse&#8221; (&#8220;飞天神鼠&#8221;), leads the local rebellion against the Jin in an effort to rescue the kidnapped envoy Zhao Gou. The rescue attempt ends up a failure, and all traces of Zhao Gou are lost.<br />\nIn order to search out Zhao Gou&#8217;s whereabouts, Li Ma enters the territories captured by the Jin and meets the Kung Fu Master Mai Tieshu and his two daughters. Tieshu is killed in a struggle with the Jin, but manages with his last breath to disclose the whereabouts of the captive emissary to Li Ma, telling his daughters, big sister and little sister Shan to aid him in the rescue mission.

The Jin seek to convert Li Ma to their side so that he can aid them in assassinating the royal family. In order to avoid arousing the suspicions of the Jin, and to vouch safe the escape of Li Ma and the envoy, Mai Shan jumps onto the sword of Li Ma when he is ordered by the Jin to kill her.<br />\nWith Mai&#8217;s death and Li Ma&#8217;s dazzling exhibitions of martial prowess, the Jin are ecstatic that Li Ma has come over to their side, and drop their guard enough for Li Ma to smuggle Zhao Gou out of the stronghold. After returning to his palace, Zhao is proclaimed emperor, and though he offers to shower Li Ma with riches and titles, he politely declines so that he can search out the younger Mai sister, who had stayed behind at the gorge.

Meanwhile, isolated behind his palace walls, the newly appointed emperor falls prey to more rumors that Li Ma is organising an army to overthrow him and usurp the crown.<br />\nAlthough Li Ma&#8217;s true intention is to drive the Jin out of China, he realises the emperor is weak in character and has grown scared of Li.

Its popularity clearly reflected the moment - with the relaxation of censorship in the early seventies, a high spirited sex comedy in the Australian idiom had special appeal for Australian audiences. Alvin (Graeme Blundell) is an ordinary young man desiring a quiet life whose very ordinariness seems irresistible to women. The comedy is based on incongruity. Sex is rendered as slapstick.

The would-be recessive hero is the object of male sexual fantsy - sex without responsibility - a fantasy with which women could also apparently identify.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 954770, "name": "Hexagon", "creator_id": 23139, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 954771, "name": "Tim Burstall", "creator_id": 66448, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-1 Digital File - 2MB Rate; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42171", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [25512]}, {"id": 98572, "acmi_id": "508373", "title": "Aluminium in the 80's: the Comalco story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "aluminium-in-the-80s-the-comalco-story", "creator_credit": "Comalco, Terence McMahon Productions and Terence McMahon", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1982", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Gives an up-to-date account of the changing forces and the topical issues confronting Australia&#8217;s aluminium industry.

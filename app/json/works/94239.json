The film stars a cast barely out of their teens themselves (in fact, some still are): Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner, Bijou Phillips, Nick Stahl and Kelli Garner, a fact not lost on Clark in casting. High school drop out and keen surfer Marty (Renfro), and pal Bobby (Stahl), have been friends since age four and throughout that period Marty has been victimised physically and verbally by his so called best friend. Marty and Bobby invite Lisa and Ali out to a &#8220;party&#8221; and a sexual relationship develops between the four that is punctuated by violence and violation. Lisa discovers she is pregnant to Marty (or is it Bobby?), in love with him, and can no longer stand Bobby&#8217;s behaviour towards Marty, vowing to have him killed. Constructing a posse of misfit delinquents comprising a Mafia hitman, lovelorn games and acid addicted cousin, dope-smoker and suicidal young sexpot, head out to the everglades to complete the task. An exploitative expose of disenfranchised teens whose ennui and lack of parental guidance allow deviant behaviour and a loss of childhood innocence.

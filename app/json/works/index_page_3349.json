Beginning with the formation of the party, which first swept to office in 1949 at the height of the Second World War, led by the charismatic Robert Menzies and follows its transistion through the leaderships of Harold Holt, John Gorton and William McMahon; and the turmoil of the Vietnam War. After 23 years the Liberals lost office in 1972 only to regain it again in 1975 under the leadership of Malcolm Fraser. It delves into the turbulent internal atmosphere which has existed within the party since the rejection of Fraser as leader, looking at the leaderships of John Howard, Andrew Peacock and John Hewson and the &#8220;Fightback&#8221; package. This is the history of the Federal Liberal Party until the loss of the 1993 election and the appointmen of a new leader, Alexander Downer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["04:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Australia - Politics and government", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Downer, Alexander, 1951-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Elections", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Fraser, Malcolm, 1930-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gorton, John, Sir", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Hewson, John R.", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Holt, Harold, 1908-1967", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Leadership", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Liberal Party of Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ McMahon, William, 1908-1988", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Peacock, Andrew, 1939-", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Politicians - Australia", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History - 1945-1965", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History - 1965-", "History&nbsp;→ Downer, Alexander, 1951-", "History&nbsp;→ Fraser, Malcolm, 1930-", "History&nbsp;→ Gorton, John, Sir", "History&nbsp;→ Hewson, John R.", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Holt, Harold, 1908-1967", "History&nbsp;→ Liberal Party of Australia", "History&nbsp;→ McMahon, William, 1908-1988", "History&nbsp;→ Menzies, Robert, Sir, 1894-1978", "History&nbsp;→ Peacock, Andrew, 1939-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Leadership", "People&nbsp;→ Downer, Alexander, 1951-", "People&nbsp;→ Fraser, Malcolm, 1930-", "People&nbsp;→ Gorton, John, Sir", "People&nbsp;→ Hewson, John R.", "People&nbsp;→ Holt, Harold, 1908-1967", "People&nbsp;→ McMahon, William, 1908-1988", "People&nbsp;→ Menzies, Robert, Sir, 1894-1978", "People&nbsp;→ Peacock, Andrew, 1939-", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 903304, "name": "Bruce Belsham", "creator_id": 21818, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121143606", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903305, "name": "Tim Clark", "creator_id": 7245, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299131", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 903303, "name": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "creator_id": 66906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 903302, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40140", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [23686]}, {"id": 84950, "acmi_id": "306295", "title": "The Letter: a film about legal rights. - [Serbian version].", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-letter-a-film-about-legal-rights-serbian-version", "creator_credit": "Aleksi Vellis, Richard Jones, Film Victoria and Legal Aid Commission of Victoria", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1995", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1995-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A guide to the basic legal rights, entitlements and responsibilities of people living in Australia, particularly non-English speaking migrants.

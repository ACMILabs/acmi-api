In the first segment on depression, a brief definition and explanation of how and why this emotional illness can cause so much grief, physically and psychically. Explains &#8216;Melancholic&#8217; and &#8216;Atypical&#8217; depression and the fact that stress can also be attributed and/or linked to depression. Suggests that learning a better response to depression rather than just trying to cure it would be far more beneficial. By using case studies, the following areas of therapy are discussed and demonstrated: Hypnotherapy; Colour therapy; Reflexology and flower remedy therapy; the Journey therapy. The second segment deals with various forms of addiction with a brief explanation of why some people suffer from this disease (10% of the population have addictive or compulsive behavior problems) and why others don&#8217;t. Through various case studies, it covers cannabis, food and alcohol addiction with discussion and demonstration of the following therapies: Homeopathic and Shamanic practice; Hypnotherapy and nutrition; Chinese medicine including acupuncture, Qi Gong and herbal therapy.

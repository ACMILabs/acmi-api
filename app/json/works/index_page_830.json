Director Peter Jackson (Heavenly creatures, The Frighteners, Meet the Feebles) went to incredible lengths to re-create Tolkien&#8217;s fantastical vision to the screen, by building extensive realistic sets in his native New Zealand, and by employing a slew of gifted special effects artists. In short, Frodo Baggins, a kind-hearted and earnest hobbit, is entrusted with the gallant mission to return a powerful ring from whence it came - Mount Doom, the only place where it can be destroyed. Failure to do so will result in the destruction of the earth, as the powerful ring is capable of unleashing inestimable evil. Guided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, Frodo is accompanied on his treacherous journey by three hobbit friends, a dwarf, an elf and several humans. This heroic quest invokes all the necessary thrills of an adventure picture, whilst satiating the exacting standards of an audience inured to CGI wizardry, and gratifying legions of zealous Tolkien fans.

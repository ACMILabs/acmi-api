But this narrative, largely related from the perspective of the servants, is less of a mystery than it is a comedy centering on the politics and mores of aristocratic society, the &#8216;upstairs&#8217; shenanigans of which are mirrored by the equally fascinating world of footmen, butlers, valets, maids and cooks, who vehemently adhere to the below stairs strictures.

Presenting over a score of well-defined players, it is a testament to Altman&#8217;s skill that none are mere ciphers, but rather sustain complex characterisations, creating a fascinating tableau of class politics, societal mores, perfidious interpersonal relationships and a cohesive panorama of human behaviour.

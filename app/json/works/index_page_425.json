This exuberant, delightful film is well up to the honour of being his last musical. Based on the 1947 Broadway hit, Fred Astaire plays an Irish rogue with a whimsical economic theory: bury a stolen crock of leprechaun gold in the soil near Fort Knox and stand back! Mixed up in the shenanigans are his spirited daughter (Petula Clark) and love-struck leprechaun (Tommy Steele). Director Francis Ford Coppola skilfully updates the Broadway hit and lovingly show cases its most enduring treasure - the Burton Lane/E.Y. Harburg score.

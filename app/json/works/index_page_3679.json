A hungry, disheveled hobo gets more than he bargains for when he staggers toward a farmhouse in search of a hot meal. To his amazement, he finds an old man with a gunshot wound to the head and a frightened girl with a heartbreaking story to tell. Feeling sorry for her, he offers to help her hop a freight train to safety. Disguised as a boy to make traveling easier the girl agrees, but despite the hobo&#8217;s best intentions to help her on her way, they end up traversing the countryside together. However, their journey is not an easy one as they attract scorn and loathing from the people they meet, hostility and suspicion from other hobos, and unwelcome attention from the police during their quest to reach Canada and forge new lives for themselves. &#8220;Beggars of Life&#8221; is loosely based on the novel &#8220;A Hobo Autobiography&#8221; (1924) by Jum Tully a popular author of the 1920&#8217;s and 1930&#8217;s and one of the founders of the school of hard-boiled writing in the United States.

series, &#8220;Day of the dead&#8221;, &#8220;Martin&#8221;, &#8220;Dawn of the dead&#8221;, &#8220;Knight riders&#8221;, &#8220;Maniac&#8221;, &#8220;Tales from the darkside&#8221; plus more.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Special effects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Costume design - Motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Aesthetics", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Violence in motion pictures", "Horror", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Theatrical makeup", "People&nbsp;→ Savini, Tom, 1943-", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2264204, "name": "Damon Santostefano", "creator_id": 34433, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2264201, "name": "Damon Santostefano", "creator_id": 34433, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2264198, "name": "Linda Laias", "creator_id": 79960, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2264196, "name": "O'Quinn Productions", "creator_id": 34431, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2264190, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

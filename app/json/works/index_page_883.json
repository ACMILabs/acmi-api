Cast also incudes Annalise Braakensiek with cameos by Merv Hughes, Tim Ferguson, Jeff Fenech, Shane Porteous, Red Symons, Bernard King and Kamahl.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Stereotype (Psychology) in mass media", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Lebanese - Australia", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Lebanese - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Machismo", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Men - Psychology"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fat-pizza", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2228407, "name": "Paul Fenech", "creator_id": 7173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228405, "name": "Tanith Carroll", "creator_id": 80848, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228402, "name": "Paul Fenech", "creator_id": 7173, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228401, "name": "Village Roadshow Pictures", "creator_id": 838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2228400, "name": "Fat Pizza", "creator_id": 36553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2228399, "name": "Roadshow Television", "creator_id": 22093, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52488", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [34036], "external_references": []}]}

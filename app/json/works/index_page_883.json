To him, this aid creates a psychological dependence in the minds of farmers and acts as a disincentive to their own production. Ayensu says food aid was originally intended to provide African countries with room to manoeuvre, but now unwanted foods (such as sugar) is virtually being dumped. He looks at the staple foods in Africa such as Cassava, fish and fruit and makes the point that if Western aid went into improving productivity in these industries, African food production would be much more efficient and better able to feed the population.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Agriculture - Africa", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Agriculture - Developing countries", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Food relief - Developing countries", "Television"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1529617, "name": "Channel 4", "creator_id": 21799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1529616, "name": "IBT", "creator_id": 24992, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1529615, "name": "VEA", "creator_id": 21531, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 115368, "acmi_id": "S01162", "title": "Battle for the planet", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "battle-for-the-planet", "creator_credit": "Channel 4 and IBT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1988", "record_type": "group", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 82847, "acmi_id": "325301", "title": "Eight litres a minute", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "eight-litres-a-minute", "creator_credit": "Channel 4 and IBT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 82849, "acmi_id": "325303", "title": "Greening the land", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "greening-the-land", "creator_credit": "Channel 4 and IBT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 82848, "acmi_id": "325302", "title": "Shifting sands", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "shifting-sands", "creator_credit": "Channel 4 and IBT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38752", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "Estimated date", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [22340]}, {"id": 82847, "acmi_id": "325301", "title": "Eight litres a minute", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "eight-litres-a-minute", "creator_credit": "Channel 4 and IBT", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 1 of Series &#8220;Battle for the planet&#8221;.<br />\nProfiles a serious form of air pollution in the West: acid rain particularly addressing the export of air pollution to the Third World as evidenced in Mexico and Brazil.

Large parts of the north and west, especially in Inner Mongolia, are badly affected. Hinton argues that there are several causes of desertification: an increase in the human population, more intensive grazing and a meat pricing system which encourages farmers to keep older animals. The result is that sandy areas break out in a few small isolated areas and eventually link up to form a huge dune which is whipped along by the wind at the rate of metres by the day. The Chinese are trying several ways to reverse the process: green belts of trees, irrigation and enclosures. However Hinton argues convincingly that the dunes will beat these measures and only a change in animal husbandry and the meat pricing system will achieve the desired end.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Episode number 2 of Series &#8220;Battle for the planet&#8221;.<br />\nThe program is presented by William Hinton, a Nebraska grazier and frequent visitor to China. One third of the world&#8217;s crop and grazing land is affected by desertification. 850 million people earn their living in these regions. In China, the problem is rapidly growing.

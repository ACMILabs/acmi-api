Episode 1. &#8220;By the rivers of Babylon&#8221;: In 586 BC, the Israelites were exiled in Babylon and seemed destined to disappear; but they fought back by writing a book using Judean stories to explain the present disastrous situations - the Bible.

Terrorism, political assassination, starvation and crucifixion dominated the landscape, ending with the Roman sack of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD.

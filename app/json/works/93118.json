Pabuji is a virtuous being who looks after his people and their animals especially during times of sickness but also in health. Raikas believe that cattle and camels are their wealth and if an animal is sick, a prayer will be made to Pabuji. The Jagraan consists of an all night epic recitation by a folk musician and singer known as a Bhopa who recounts the legend and deeds of Pajubi to an audience made up mostly of livestock herders. Although a religious event it is also seen to be entertainment for the community. Sadly though, the practice of Jagraan is under threat as village herders are being pushed out by agribusiness and limestone mining. These industries have taken their land which has led to a decrease in grazing land for their herds. At the same time there is no government support and construction sites are appearing all over rural Rajasthan. The old traditional ways of Bhopas with their musical instruments and costume dress is also disappearing due to the diminishing rural population and modern technology in the form of radio and television.

Different people like different things - for instance, Grandpa, who goes to sleep during a sequence on kitchen planning, wakes joyfully at the sound of a square dance. But all groups agree that they want films on their programs, if they can get them, and that is where the film council comes in. Animation shows how a council is set up, and how a number of organisations in an area can collaborate in buying a projector. We see projectionist training, and the public library becoming a distribution centre for films as well as books.

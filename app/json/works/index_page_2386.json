Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is travelling aimlessly through Texas, having left behind his son in LA with his successful brother Walt (Dean Stockwell). Found half dead in the desert, Travis decides to go back for his son and take him on a journey in search of the boy&#8217;s mother (Nastassja Kinski). Their search ends in a cheap strip-joint and Travis and his ex-wife confront each other about lost dreams and past betrayals. Visually striking, and intellectually stimulating, &#8220;Paris, Texas&#8221; is scripted by Sam Shepard and based on his own volume of short stories, &#8220;Motel chronicles&#8221;. The haunting musical score is by Ry Cooder.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - France - Cannes - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/paris-texas", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2188291, "name": "Wim Wenders", "creator_id": 4503, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55411", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188290, "name": "Anatole Dauman", "creator_id": 69973, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2845576", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188288, "name": "Don Guest", "creator_id": 4504, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188285, "name": "Argos Films", "creator_id": 69972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2188286, "name": "Road Movies", "creator_id": 23674, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2188279, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51198", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [33085]}, {"id": 93579, "acmi_id": "317087", "title": "Claire of the moon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "claire-of-the-moon", "creator_credit": "Nicole Conn, Pam Kuri and Demi-Monde Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1992", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1992-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46151, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q4224297"}], "brief_description": "<p>Two successful writers&#8212;a promiscuous heterosexual novelist and a brooding lesbian sex therapist&#8212;are assigned a cabin together on a writer&#8217;s retreat for women.

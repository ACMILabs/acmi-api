For the filmmakers, the productions simply reflect the ambient pessimism, the fear of an impeding war and the tragedies already occuring in Spain.

Naturally enough, 1940 saw French film production reduced to an unprecedented low of thirty-nine films. Many film personnel were lost to the industry. A few (such as composer Maurice Jaubert) were killed in action, but most simply fled the country. Directors Jean Renoir, Rene Clair and Max Ophuls began new careers in Hollywood, while Alexandre Trauner and a number of other Jewish technicians sought temporary safety in the south (the &#8216;free&#8217; zone was later invaded by Germany).

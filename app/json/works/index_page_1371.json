Newly appointed as acting mayor of the Yingzhou city, Xiao announced that he would do ten good things for the city at his inauguration. He encouraged the local peasants to build a bridge through self-financing, and he lent his support to the director of Baiyun Pharmaceutical Factory in terms of promoting a blacklisted engineer, Li Huaxin. Xiao also helped Li Huaxin’s daughter, who was not allowed to go abroad to study because of her father’s background. As an acting mayor, Xiao made some achievements but also aroused controversy. Even the Party Secretary, who had been supportive, thought that Xiao was too radical in some aspects. Xiao’s wife and daughter are concerned about people’s misunderstanding, but Xiao is determined to carry on the reforms, believing that he is in line with the central government as long as what he does benefits the people. At a news conference, Xiao says he would rather break rules than go against the will of the people. In order to fulfill his promise to do ten good things, Xiao asks for a new term of three months as acting mayor.</p>\n<p>The film should be understood in relation to China’s reform in the early 1980s.

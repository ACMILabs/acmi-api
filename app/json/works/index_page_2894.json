But &#8220;Donnie Darko&#8221; is more than just a clever pastiche of genre-awareness scenarios and a hip/clever postmodern appropriation of film-school inspirations; the film surpasses these limitations with a view that is creative, passionate, compelling and defiantly original.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:02:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School environment", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Brothers and sisters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Teenagers - Family relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Hypnotism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Identity (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychology, Pathological", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Schizophrenia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Teenagers", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Time travel"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/donnie-darko", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2199037, "name": "Richard Kelly", "creator_id": 80803, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q711022", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2199028, "name": "Adam Fields", "creator_id": 80802, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q30131271", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2199031, "name": "Nancy Juvonen", "creator_id": 79521, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3335584", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2199036, "name": "Sean McKittrick", "creator_id": 60043, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2199023, "name": "Flower Films", "creator_id": 52109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2199024, "name": "Pandora Cinema", "creator_id": 28123, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2199019, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52350", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [33936]}, {"id": 92768, "acmi_id": "316089", "title": "Don Bradman: 87 not out", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "don-bradman-87-not-out", "creator_credit": "Peter Wynne and Nine Network", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1996", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Born in Cootamundra, New South Wales on 27 August 1908, Don Bradman was eventually to become an Australian icon, and a somewhat reluctant hero.

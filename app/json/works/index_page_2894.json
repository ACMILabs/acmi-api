Confined to a mental institution and treated by the ineffectual Doctor Silverman (Stephen Rea), Claire - under the influence of Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey Jr.) - escapes and faces her maligned alterego head on. In a splendid closing montage of water imagery, Claire ultimately finds harmony, peace and tranquillity. By acclaimed director Neil Jordan, &#8220;In Dreams&#8221; is a dark and unnerving film that gives full and rich exploration to the theme of the unconscious as a pool of mixed desires and impulses. Also features excellent cinematography by Darius Khondji.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:35:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Serial murderers", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Dreams", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoses", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Subconsciousness", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dreams"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815197, "name": "Stephen Woolley", "creator_id": 71841, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7610883", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961311, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 961313, "name": "Neil Jordan", "creator_id": 10134, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55428", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 961310, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50314", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [32295], "external_references": [{"id": 410, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1687420"}]}, {"id": 68815, "acmi_id": "321606", "title": "In dense traffic", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "in-dense-traffic", "creator_credit": "Frank Bagnall, John Edwards and Australian Commonwealth Film Unit", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1969", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1969-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 10 of Series &#8220;How to Drive&#8221;.<br />\nTown driving demands great powers of concentration, road observation, the ability to react quickly to changing situations, and considerable driving skill.

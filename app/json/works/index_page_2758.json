Wood travels from Europe to India on an epic 20,000 mile journey in search of the truth behind one of history&#8217;s greatest stories. Travelling by bus, steam train, ancient sail boat and camel train, Michael follows the tracks of Alexander the Great into the heart of Asia. Along the route through Egypt, the Khyber Pass, Pakistan&#8217;s Indus River and the dreaded Makran Desert, the history and myths of this great figure are explored. Scholars, Turkish bards, Uzbek herders and those who claim descent from Alexander&#8217;s army all enlighten a fantastic journey and tell the story of a man who left an indelible mark on the history of the world.

She comes to a group of kids having a massive snowfight then remembers the horrors of war when a boy gets snow in his eyes. Now, everytime she sees these things she flashes back to all those Korean babies, crying for their mothers among the destruction of a futile battlefield. She arrives at Garrison Command Nursery School and<br />\nmeets the two children: Weiwei and Chuanchuan, who, mistaking her for their own mother, are overjoyed to see her, calling out and running to her with arms outstretched.<br />\nShe kisses them and feels it is impossible for her to just leave them all alone in the world. In spite of all her plans, her life, her career, her lover, she decides she must keep these children.<br />\nAfter being reunited at last with her sweetheart Huang Yisheng, she realises he does not share her sentiments and wants children of his own  - not someone else&#8217;s. She eventually breaks off her engagement with Huang, telling the children that their father has gone off on business. Later she hears that Zhang Sen, who she admired through the war as the hero who had risked his own life to protect a group of the enemy&#8217;s children, is alive. Zhang meets her and expresses his love for her, but she rebuffs him. Zhang explains that he knows about the children and wants to be their father. She asks why and he explains that he was also orphaned as a child and only survived thanks to the love of a woman like Ouyang, who took him as her own and nurtured him.</p>\n<p>The film ends with them all starting a happy family together.<br />\n(2 stars: James Donald; June 10, 2011)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ People's Liberation Army (China)", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Asia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ China - History", "History&nbsp;→ China - History - 20th century", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889675, "name": "Changchun Film Studio", "creator_id": 34767, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889676, "name": "Chang Yan", "creator_id": 82283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 889677, "name": "Chang Yan", "creator_id": 82283, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889678, "name": "Li Lingxiu", "creator_id": 82284, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889679, "name": "Gao Hongbao", "creator_id": 82285, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889680, "name": "Li Zhonglin", "creator_id": 82286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889681, "name": "Xiaoqing Liu", "creator_id": 82287, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889682, "name": "Wang Zhihua", "creator_id": 82288, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889683, "name": "Guojun Chen", "creator_id": 82289, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 889684, "name": "Yang Yaqin", "creator_id": 82290, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146396", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [55244]}]}

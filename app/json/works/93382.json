The story begins in 1792 in Vienna where Beethoven, aged 22, is studying music and composition under one of the music masters of the time, Joseph Haydn. It is Beethoven&#8217;s early period when his enthusiasm is ahead of his ability, particularly in the high classical style, but it is also a time for him to establish himself as a pianist and a composer and earn an income.

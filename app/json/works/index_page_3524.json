The program is geared towards making children understand that divorce is not the end of their family; focusing on why couples fall in and out of love; what happens to parents when they separate and how the family must cope with new responsibilities. The program seeks to comfort children who may be blaming themselves for the family breakup. Animated and simply narrated, this program is more suited to middle primary school children and above.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:29:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animation - Juvenile films", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children of divorced parents", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 789705, "name": "Paternoster Nominees", "creator_id": 27430, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 789706, "name": "Consolidated Productions", "creator_id": 27431, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 789707, "name": "Stephen Smallwood", "creator_id": 27432, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 789704, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41450", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [24941]}, {"id": 98481, "acmi_id": "508218", "title": "Divorce and young people", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "divorce-and-young-people", "creator_credit": "Golden Coast Film Productions and Nick Vincent", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1980", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1980-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Depicts some of the most common fears, conflicts and problems that children face when their parents are going through divorce and demonstrates certain methods of coping with the various emotions that arise.

According to his daughter, George was ‘optimistic, happy and enthusiastic’, an outlook reflected in his films which are a history of home life and a love of travel.</p>\n<p>George came to Australia from England as a young man by way of the merchant navy, after having seen South America and some of Asia. He met his future wife Sybil, who was impressed by George’s world travels and his dreams for the future.</p>\n<p>The family lived in the Melbourne suburb of North Balwyn, spending their summers camping at Wye River on the Victorian coast often with extended family and friends.</p>\n<p>George and Sybil must have shared a sense of adventure as they eventually sold the family home and sailed on the ‘SS Orontes’ to England, travelling around Britain for two years.</p>\n<p>The George Malins Home Movie Collection was donated to ACMI by the creator’s daughter Ruth Hargrave. The films were made on 16mm film.</p>\n<p>This film shows the Malins family in a montage of holidays and events in Victoria spanning several years from 1946 to the 1950s (not in precise chronological order). Highlights include a visit to Melbourne Zoo, trips to the beach along the Great Ocean Road and to Phillip Island, as well as trips to the snow at Lake Mountain. Malins frequently captured road signs of their travel destinations, including Anglesea, Lorne, Wye River and Cowes. Other moments captured include children’s birthday parties, horse riding and children at school (possibly Koonung Heights Primary School in Mont Albert North, 1954–1993).</p>\n<p>The film also features footage of an historic gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance on the occasion of Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery’s visit to Melbourne in 1947.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights (time codes from Access Overscan)<br />\n00:00:02:00  (upside down footage) caged orangutan at Zoo eating an ice cream<br />\n00:00:15:00  entrance to Melbourne Zoo<br />\n00:00:20:00  visitor hands food to a white-cheeked gibbon through cage fence<br />\n00:00:29:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John picnic on lawn, with the Taggart family<br />\n00:00:45:00  children ride the open-carriage train, ‘Zoo Spirit of Progress’ written on side of driver’s car (a reference to Victorian Railways premier express train from Melbourne to Albury)<br />\n00:01:07:00  children riding on an Indian Elephant<br />\n00:01:15:00  horse performing tricks for audience, balancing on a see-saw, riding and bucking in the arena with a baboon (possibly a hamadryas baboon) on back<br />\n00:01:40:00  George, Sybil, Helen and John with Mabel Malins (Nana) having a picnic with fire next to river, great shots of family members eating and smiling, at Healesville Sanctuary<br />\n00:02:40:00  Children play in yard.

The collection contains Eidlitz&#8217;s experiments with light, movement and technology in film.</p>\n<p>This film shows the 1966 construction of Alexander Calder&#8217;s &#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; (The Big Sail), a monumental sculpture installed in McDermott Court at MIT in Cambridge.</p>\n<p>Trained as a mechanical engineer, and born into a renowned family of artists, Calder began making kinetic artworks in the 1930s. Known as &#8216;mobiles&#8217; the sculptures had moveable parts, were light and delicate in form, and often included a mechanical motor. By the late 1950s, Calder had begun making &#8216;stabiles&#8217;, which retained the sense of lightness and dynamism of his smaller works, but were formed on a monumental scale and stable on the ground. &#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; is emblematic of this period of his work.</p>\n<p>&#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; was a gift to MIT by Eugene and Margaret McDermott, who were arts patrons and benefactors to the institute. The sculpture was fabricated in France and shipped to MIT in parts; made up of five panels bolted together, the sculpture is 40 feet tall and comprised of 33 tons of painted steel.</p>\n<p>The film features Calder overseeing the installation of &#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; in the courtyard. Footage of the artist wearing a hard hat is overlaid with footage of workers piecing the sculpture together. The film emphasises the interplay between the curved lines and angles of the steel sheets, and the balance between the monolithic weight and its delicate legs.</p>\n<p>The film is accompanied by a recording of Bing Crosby&#8217;s &#8216;Dinah&#8217;, which is then spliced together with &#8216;Little Sir Echo&#8217;.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Calder</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Frank Eidlitz</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1966</p>", "description": "<p>The Frank Eidlitz Collection contains the 16mm and 35mm film work of graphic designer and visual artist Frank Eidlitz (1923–1997), predominantly made during a Winston Churchill Fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge in 1966.

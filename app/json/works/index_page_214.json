Working for the first time without his regular leading lady, Divine, Waters hands the reigns over to Edith Massey (the crib bound egg lady from Waters infamous &#8220;Pink Flamingo&#8217;s&#8221;), an appropriate substitute to fill the famous drag queen&#8217;s pumps, and if one star wasn&#8217;t enough, busty strip artiste Liz Renay makes a wonderfully sleazy film debut as Muffy St. Jacques, a part originally intended for Divine (who was touring in her one woman show at the time). All the while Waters tries his best to gross us out and make us laugh. Long live the Pope of trash! Cast includes Susan Lowe and Mary Vivian Pearce.

Every year on the anniversary of his failed marriage, Mr. Kessler conducts dinner with his estranged wife&#8217;s ghost within the claustrophobic confines of the house they once shared. The mysterious death of the new housemaid barely creates a disturbance due to the frequency of murders that have occurred in the house in recent months. Mr. Kessler, his daughter Virginia, and Evans the butler struggle to maintain calm as the body count escalates, and the police search for clues to the latest killings. As all the clues begin to add up it seems that the killer may be closer to home than first suspected, and that an evil force reaching beyond the grave may also be to blame.

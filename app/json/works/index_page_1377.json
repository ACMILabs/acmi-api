Ivan (John Cusack) is the exuberant friend who is accustomed to getting the more reserved Josh (Tim Robbins) into trouble. Forming Video Aces, Ivan encourages Josh to develop his creativity whilst the business-like Ivan helms the operation. Initially the pair work on a hilarious rapping commercial for a chicken and waffle outlet and a dying man&#8217;s video-will.

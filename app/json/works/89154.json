Pregnant and alone, Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) leaves her native home of Ireland in search of Johnny, father of her unborn child. Arriving in Birmingham with few clues as to his location, she meets factory canteen manager Mr Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), a seemingly benevolent gent who offers to help Felicia find lodgings and her love.

But like all good B-grade, exploitation cinema, Verhoeven indulges in genre cinema and lowly attitudes of sex and gender in a highly energised, dazzling mode in order to give them a new spin.

And of course there was nothing better than a bit of comedy to lighten up their lives through such stars as Bob Hope and Abbott and Costello. &#8220;Showbiz goes to war&#8221; is a wonderful documentary put together with many classical film excerpts, trailers, archival newsreel footage of World War II, and includes such Hollywood stars as Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Clark Gable, James Cagney, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, John Wayne and a cast of thousands. Watch out for that gem of a comedy sketch by Abbott and Costello &#8220;Who&#8217;s on first?&#8221; - it&#8217;s a classic.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Entertainers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture industry - United States", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Archival resources", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Marketing", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Plots, themes, etc", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Social aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - United States - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures in propaganda", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ War and society", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - Propaganda", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ World War, 1939-1945 - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Glamour photography", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Motion pictures in propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nationalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Patriotism", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Entertainers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture actors and actresses", "War films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2298922, "name": "Gail Gibson Sedawie", "creator_id": 80200, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2298920, "name": "Norman Sedawie", "creator_id": 80199, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producers/directors", "role_id": 628, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2298915, "name": "Glen-Warren Productions", "creator_id": 34957, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2298911, "name": "T A D Productions", "creator_id": 34950, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2298906, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50797", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [32759], "external_references": []}, {"id": 82453, "acmi_id": "303603", "title": "Show me what you look like", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "show-me-what-you-look-like", "creator_credit": "Brian Nicholson, Michael Whitehead and IKON (GB)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This is an experimental video.

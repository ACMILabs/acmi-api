With both sides once again back in the same footy league, locals can’t wait for the big clash.</p>\n<p>Oh well, they don’t have a lot going for them down there in Hepburn.

I’ve been connected with Hepburn ever since, and I don’t know, the rivalry was there before my time, it was always…I think every town that is close has the rivalry in the footy sides. When they put the sewage line down through Hepburn, well there were people in Daylesford said “Oh great, we been waiting years to shit on Hepburn”.

From Hepburn to Ouyen, to Swifts Creek, fundraising is an essential part of all footy clubs.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements to Laurince Pedretti, Kate Commins, Derry Monaghan, Ray Gallagher and Tom Greenaway. Archival video and still images reproduced with kind permission of Swifts Creek FNC, Ouyen United FC and Laurince Pedretti.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[YELL]</p>\n<p>[FAINT WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>[LOUD WHISTLE]</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>BILL PEDRETTI: If you&#8217;re going to win premierships, you&#8217;ve got to run The Forty Club like a business. And you&#8217;ve got to work hard at it. We used to have a lot of fun, but we never won many games.</p>\n<p>[HORN BLOWING]</p>\n<p>So we turned it around. And that&#8217;s why in the last 20 years we&#8217;ve won premierships. In the &#8216;80s, the cash was $2,000. That was big money. And we could rise up with&#8212; we took raffles and dinner dances and things like that. And then in the &#8216;90s when we were just struggling, we realized we had no money. We have to do something better. And that&#8217;s when we first started wrestling the Harley Davidsons. Four of the committee rang up together and all put in, and we brought a motorbike. And from then on, it was just full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>[MOTOR RUNNING]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: I see our biggest challenge as being fundraising, because we have a pretty clear idea of what we are going to get from a go at the Canteen and the bar. And that&#8217;s enough to cover our expenses. But it&#8217;s not enough to do anything with new buildings. It&#8217;s not enough to repair our fairly basic amenities. We can&#8217;t send players on trips and things like that. We cannot afford to pay our player&#8217;s memberships. We have to ask them to pay, that sort of thing. I&#8217;ve really got to watch all the costs.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>DERRY MONAGHAN: They certainly all pick [INAUDIBLE] stumps. And not for a while they haven&#8217;t, but we did that at [INAUDIBLE] just to try and get a couple of extra players each year. And the local boys here cut wood to source money for the football trip.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>The main source of income is the Vic Grain Bunkers. We have the contract to empty them the [INAUDIBLE] Bunkers. And when we get enough trucks, we can make a lot of money. And that&#8217;s how we source the money to run the club. Now it&#8217;s one in, all in, and from me, down to the players.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: Really, the things that keep small country towns going are your pub, your football team, and your primary school. Well, all of those things are kind of in part of our football club. And I think that most people are prepared to come and be part of it, put in that extra bit, do those few extra jobs.

We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo. And the rest was history, I suppose.</p>\n<p>[FANS CHEERING]</p>\n<p>[OTHER SIDE BOOING]</p>\n<p>And then if you thought that was erupting over there, well, the display when I was over other side of game was something to behold. I thought I was going to be choked to death, actually. There was that many people all over there. And yeah, pretty exciting stuff.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I guess I played all my junior footy at Waaia. And my dream as a young bloke was always to kick a goal like that after the siren. And to do that for your own town and win a Grand Final&#8212; I mean, just to win a game is normally pretty exciting, but to do it in a Grand Final, every now and then, you relive the moment, and it&#8217;s an amazing feeling. Sort of get a chill up your spine now even still.</p>\n<p>Yeah, but just to&#8212; I suppose to win a Grand Final off your own boot, in that respect, with one kick&#8212; I was just lucky to have that opportunity, I suppose.

I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here. I just kept jogging until he pointed on the mark, and I never stopped. Just jogged in and like a torpedo. And the rest was history, I suppose.</p>\n<p>[FANS CHEERING]</p>\n<p>[OTHER SIDE BOOING]</p>\n<p>And then if you thought that was erupting over there, well, the display when I was over other side of game was something to behold. I thought I was going to be choked to death, actually. There was that many people all over there. And yeah, pretty exciting stuff.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I guess I played all my junior footy at Waaia.

And to do that for your own town and win a Grand Final&#8212; I mean, just to win a game is normally pretty exciting, but to do it in a Grand Final, every now and then, you relive the moment, and it&#8217;s an amazing feeling. Sort of get a chill up your spine now even still.</p>\n<p>Yeah, but just to&#8212; I suppose to win a Grand Final off your own boot, in that respect, with one kick&#8212; I was just lucky to have that opportunity, I suppose.

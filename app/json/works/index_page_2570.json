The action of natural forces, heat, wind, rain and ice cause rocks to crumble, forming silt which is carried down into the ocean to form layers of sediment on the sea bed. Pressure of further layers deposited above, produces the rocks in which oil is slowly formed from the remains of the marine life. Animated diagrams show how the oil under pressure tends to migrate through the rocks, until it either finds its way through to the surface or is trapped in one of the formations for which oil-seekers look.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Oil fields", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Earth", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geological time", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology, Stratigraphic", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Oil fields", "Documentary", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "History&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth - Origin", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Earth sciences", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Formations (Geology)", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geological time", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology, Stratigraphic", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Geology, Structural", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Historical geology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Metamorphism (Geology)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Netherlands"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1818964, "name": "Sir Arthur Hallam Elton", "creator_id": 13679, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849265, "name": "Shell Film Unit", "creator_id": 12202, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 849267, "name": "Bert Haanstra", "creator_id": 13334, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21552", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 15, "name": "Netherlands", "slug": "netherlands"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1953", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1953"}], "labels": [5440], "external_references": []}]}

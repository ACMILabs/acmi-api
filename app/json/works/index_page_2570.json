Living in Paris Diego makes repeated trips to Spain to work for the cause. Through his close collaboration with Jorge Semprun, the Spanish novelist then in exile, Resnais constructs the tragedy of a man who has come to question the very thing that has defined the value of his existence. He is bound to continue &#8216;the war&#8217; but for him it is now more personal than political. Diego&#8217;s relationships with two women represent the myth and reality of his political life. The rhythms of the film are harnessed to Diego&#8217;s subjectivity - the memories, imaginings and connections in his mind together with moments of profound feeling.

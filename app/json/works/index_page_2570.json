or Joao Francisco dos Santos (1900-76) a man born to the streets, who lives with a whore, her daughter and Tabu, the family slave. Fraternising in petty crime, Joao becomes drawn to the stage, and develops an exotic show, replete with elaborate costumes and erotic themes. But Joao&#8217;s temper and talents with a switchblade, land him in constant strife. This bio-pic, directed by Karim Ainouz, is an exciting and gritty presentation of a paradoxical personality; he lays bare the realities and squalor of poverty whilst bringing all the glamour of performance art to the screen. The central performance by Lazaro Ramos, is compelling and convincing, bringing Joao&#8217;s vitality, flamboyance and commanding presence to life.

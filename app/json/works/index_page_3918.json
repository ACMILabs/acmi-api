Birds discussed are: Wandering Albatross; Providence Petrel; Black-winged Petrel; Flesh-footed Shearwater; Wedge-tailed Shearwater; Australasian Gannet; Masked Booby; Sooty Tern; Grey Noddy; Brown Noddy; White Tern; Red-tailed Tropicbird.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Birds", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Birds - Australia", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Birds - Environmental aspects", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Birds - Migration", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Birds - Polar regions", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Sea birds", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Zoology - Australia", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Birds - Environmental aspects", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1427392, "name": "Grant Young", "creator_id": 28365, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1427391, "name": "GEO Wildlife Documentaries", "creator_id": 28364, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427390, "name": "GEO Wildlife Documentaries", "creator_id": 28364, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "42570", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [25842], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94143, "acmi_id": "317925", "title": "Australia's art of the Dreamtime: Quinkin country (A)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "australias-art-of-the-dreamtime-quinkin-country-a", "creator_credit": "WIPB-TV, Ball State University and Jim Needham", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1988", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1988-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An informative and educational documentary on the history of Australian Aborigines and their rock art in the Cape York Peninsula region of Queensland.

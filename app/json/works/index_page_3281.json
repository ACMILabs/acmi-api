This episode profiles the &#8216;Golden age of silent film&#8217; and the incursion of Avant-Garde and Art Deco aesthetics in feature films. During WWI, European cinema (and particularly the houses of Gaumont, Pathe and L&#8217;Eclair) endures a reversal of fortune under both the economic and stylistic pressure of the USA. Melies has sold his studio, star Max Linder is seeking fortune in the USA. French cinema is stagnant and unable to extract itself from the theatrical stylistics of the &#8216;film d&#8217;art&#8217; (literary adaptations), while the U.S. are holding audiences captive with weekly deliveries of adventure and comic serials. During the Roaring Twenties, French cinema renews itself entirely through its first avant-garde movement (expressionism) and second avant-garde (surrealism). Influenced by D.W. Griffiths&#8217; &#8216;Broken Blossoms&#8217;(1919), Delluc sought in his own films to convey, through editing, the motions of human psychology, and to this end developed the flashback technique in &#8216;La femme de nulle part&#8217; (1922). The innovations in film technique which resulted from impressionists&#8217; desire to evoke human subjectivity included close-ups, camera movements, rapid editing, flashbacks and subjective point-of-view shots. Marcel L&#8217;Herbier &#8216;El Dorado&#8217; (1921) features &#8216;semi-subjective&#8217; sequences to express a character&#8217;s psychological state. Rhythmic cutting to express a drunken or unstable state of mind, first evident in Abel Gance&#8217;s &#8216;La roue&#8217; (1922) and subsequently in Jean Epstein&#8217;s &#8216;Coeur fidele&#8217; (1923) was perhaps the technique most linked to the movement.&#8221; (1) Influenced by the Avant-Garde and the Art Deco style, Marcel L&#8217;Herbier directs two major projects in the 1920s: &#8216;L&#8217;inhumaine&#8217; (1924), starring Brigitte Helm, for which he assembled the most brilliant artists of his time: Robert Mallet-Stevens, Fernand Leger, Paul Poiret, Darius Milhaud; and &#8216;L&#8217;argent&#8217; (1929)[NLA #0678050] in which L&#8217;Herbier directs fascinating experiments with camera mobility. This episode profiles &#8216;Crainquebille&#8217; (1923), directed by Jacques Feyder, a dramatic tale set in popular Paris and prefiguring &#8216;Poetic realism&#8217;. Also featured, Abel Gance&#8217;s early science-fiction serials &#8216;La folie du Docteur Tube&#8217; (1915) [NLA #2108421], &#8216;La roue&#8217; and his anti-war film &#8216;J&#8217;accuse&#8217;(1937).

This episode profiles the &#8216;Golden age of silent film&#8217; and the incursion of Avant-Garde and Art Deco aesthetics in feature films. During WWI, European cinema (and particularly the houses of Gaumont, Pathe and L&#8217;Eclair) endures a reversal of fortune under both the economic and stylistic pressure of the USA. Melies has sold his studio, star Max Linder is seeking fortune in the USA. French cinema is stagnant and unable to extract itself from the theatrical stylistics of the &#8216;film d&#8217;art&#8217; (literary adaptations), while the U.S. are holding audiences captive with weekly deliveries of adventure and comic serials. During the Roaring Twenties, French cinema renews itself entirely through its first avant-garde movement (expressionism) and second avant-garde (surrealism). Influenced by D.W. Griffiths&#8217; &#8216;Broken Blossoms&#8217;(1919), Delluc sought in his own films to convey, through editing, the motions of human psychology, and to this end developed the flashback technique in &#8216;La femme de nulle part&#8217; (1922). The innovations in film technique which resulted from impressionists&#8217; desire to evoke human subjectivity included close-ups, camera movements, rapid editing, flashbacks and subjective point-of-view shots. Marcel L&#8217;Herbier &#8216;El Dorado&#8217; (1921) features &#8216;semi-subjective&#8217; sequences to express a character&#8217;s psychological state.

By the mid-thirties, French cinema is enjoying a phase of expansion. Surprisingly, the influx of German personnel fleeing the Nazi regime helps expanding the market for French cinema into Eastern Europe. This is the time during which Pommer leaves UFA to work in Paris to produce &#8216;Liliom&#8217; with Fritz Lang. An other emigre is Pabst who directs &#8216;The Three Penny Opera&#8217;<em> and &#8216;L&#8217;Atlantide&#8217;, starring Brigitte Helm. Alexander Korda, brought to France by Pagnol to direct &#8216;Marius&#8217;</em> also directs &#8216;La dame de chez Maxim&#8217;s&#8217;, before returning to the UK. For most of the German emigres such as Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak, Anatole Litvak, Fritz lang, G. W. Pabst, France was only a stop over on their way to real careers and prospects in Hollywood. It must also be noted that certain members of the French film industry did go out of their way to make them feel rather unwelcome. This nationalist animosity is best expressed in a revealing interview with Claude Autant-Lara. These few years are the golden age of commercial production: producers make safe bets with adaptations of theatrical success, bordering on the Vaudeville, and using to great effect the strong presence of character actors, such as Fernandel, Raimu, Larquey, etc &#8230; Distraught at the arrival of sound, French cinema seems to have opted for an increasing banality.

Not so with the pictures of Jacques Henri Lartigue (1894-1986), who produced stunning and sophisticated images from the time he was seven years old. Lartigue was in love with motion, and his subjects  cars racing, flying machines and glider planes, people jumping, fashionable ladies strolling in the park, vacationers at the seashore and the races embody the exhilaration of movement. Zany and amusing, Lartigue&#8217;s work seems a testament to happiness itself, and this book  with 126 duotone photos and 16 gatefolds  is a fitting celebration of his legacy.&#8221; Reference: Vicki Goldberg. &#8216;Jacques Henri Lartigue, photographer&#8217;.

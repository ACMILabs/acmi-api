This extremely entertaining version by puppeteer and director Frank Oz (The Dark crystal, The Muppets take Manhattan, Dirty rotten scoundrels, The Empire strikes back [voice of Yoda], Return of the Jedi, The Phantom menace) features Rick Moranis as the nerdy Seymour Krelborn who works in the florist shop near Skid Row, Vincent Gardenia as Mushnik his boss, and Ellen Greene as Audrey, the shop assistant and woman Seymour secretly desires. When Seymour buys a small exotic plant which suddenly appeared after an eclipse of the sun, strange things begin to happen. Audrey II (Seymour&#8217;s name for the plant) takes on a personality of its own and develops quite a unique appetite, wanting to be continually fed, not with plant food, but with blood, and the more it is fed, the bigger Audrey II becomes.

It took many years of writing and campaigning before Kath Walker began to see a change in public attitude but it was the setting up of Moongalba, an educational and cultural centre for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children, on North Stradbroke Island (her place of birth) in 1972 which was to be Kath Walker&#8217;s most ambitious and passionate project. She believed that teaching the young together in the studies of Aboriginal culture would assist in bridging the gap between the two races. In 1988 Kath Walker officially changed her name to Oodgeroo Noonuccal to more closely identify herself with her Aboriginal roots. She lived out her latter years on North Stradbroke Island continuing her teaching role at Moongalba until she finally died of cancer in 1993.

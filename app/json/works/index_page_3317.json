As the filmmaker drives around the ruins of Beirut he documents, amid the chaos and the ruins, signs of life. Toufic films the inmates of the Fanar Mental Hospital; disabled adult men, living in a decrepit institution - a reflection on the forgotten underclass of any society that is torn asunder by war. He then interviews a Lebanese man who is enraged by the injustices that he sees committed around him, identifying himself as a messenger of the prophet Mohammed and Jesus Christ.

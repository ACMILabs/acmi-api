Family beach fun is shown as children play in the shallows, people sunbake or rest in the shade of an umbrella, knit, go camping, wash baby in a big plastic tub, walk over the dunes, go surfing or play ballgames. &#8220;The Rose Chapel of St Helena&#8221; is a sequence approximately two minutes long about a small church in the Eltham/Greensborough area but before getting to that area there are a couple of shots of the City of Melbourne.

Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>In this film Les and Dorothy Nixon show off their first baby Karen (who features in the Nixon Collection until she is an adult herself) at their home in Herne Hill, Geelong, Victoria. There are also a few family weddings and visits and outings around Victoria.</p>\n<p>These scenes are a lovely showcase of a baby’s first months, Karen’s first smiles, sitting up, being fed first ‘solids’, learning to crawl on the carpet, trying to open the kitchen cupboards and eventually walking. As well as these usual baby activities we see them in the context of the 1960s - style of clothes, carseat, bassinette, pram and playpen.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:25:00 infant

Along the way, the films also record the distinctive fashion (often handmade) and hairstyles of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, through Dorothy Nixon being so stylish a dresser herself, and at the many family weddings across the extended family.</p>\n<p>The films are made on Standard 8mm and then Super 8mm film, and are in reasonable condition though a little shaky or damaged at times.</p>\n<p>This film captures a major event in the lives of the Nixon family – daughter Karen’s wedding. The fashion on the day is a wonderful example of the late 1980s and the bridesmaids wear Karen’s favourite colour, red. Karen’s new family, the Corrys, are in the film having visited from the UK.</p>\n<p>Of interest in this film, when Karen arrives at the church there are many onlookers who are there but are not guests. At this period of time it was still customary, particularly in country areas, for members of the community to come along to watch the bridal party arrive and leave the church.</p>\n<p>Later we see Karen preparing to leave for overseas possibly to Indonesia as we view a Garuda airplane from what appears to be the Observation Deck at Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne, when it was still open.</p>\n<p>This film also contains scenes of a new kitten in the family, inside the house and in the yard chasing a rope hanging from the clothes line.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br

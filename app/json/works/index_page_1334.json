Born in Budapest, Hungary, Tibor lived in Melbourne, Victoria with his family. His wife Merna Koller was a frequent collaborator on these films, showing a shared interest in filmmaking.</p>\n<p>Tibor captured suburban family life in Melbourne, including family celebrations, urban scenes and regional holidays. Tibor was actively engaged in the lapidary society of Australia. Several of his films show opal fields and gemstone artisans at work, as well as the 1969 &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; in Beechworth, Victoria, a national festival organised by the lapidary clubs of Australia. Tibor also travelled to Idar-Oberstein in Germany, historically known as a gemstone town, and to Japan.</p>\n<p>The Tibor Zoltan Koller Home Movie Collection has been donated to ACMI by the filmmaker&#8217;s daughter Vicki Koller.

The first &#8216;Gemboree&#8217; was held in 1965 as a gathering of lapidaries to showcase gemstones and minerals and has continued annually since. The film opens with elaborate title cards setting up the film, which is credited to both Tibor and wife Merna Koller.

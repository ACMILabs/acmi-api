In this video students will learn about some of the ways that marine creatures have adapted to this constant struggle. They will see that an animal&#8217;s survival in the ocean depends on numerous defensive techniques. Sometimes these defensive strategies work, and sometimes they don&#8217;t. If an animal&#8217;s defenses are not adequate, it will be eaten. On the other hand, if a predator is unable to overcome the defenses of it&#8217;s potential food source, it may starve. The methods used by animals to survive in the sea can be ingenious, unusual and wonderful. Suitable for Mid-Upper Primary level students.

One fateful night he meets Bess (Stacy Edwards) and asks her to marry him the same day. The pair marry and Bess joins him on stage as his assistant. Houdini soon realises that to be the greatest, he must convince the audience he will die. From this premise, the legend of Houdini is born. This feature successfully portrays both the legend and the man, with interesting insights into Houdini&#8217;s struggle for the love and acceptance of his mother and the great burden this places on his marriage. As Houdini ages, he becomes obsessed with the existence of the after life, vowing to escape death as he escapes.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magic", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Magicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magic", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Magicians", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Houdini, Harry, 1874-1926"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1807730, "name": "Leanne Moore", "creator_id": 32736, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878224, "name": "Turner Network Television", "creator_id": 24880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878225, "name": "Trilogy Entertainment Group", "creator_id": 30226, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 878227, "name": "Pen Densham", "creator_id": 18444, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 878223, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48491", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [30646], "external_references": []}, {"id": 88194, "acmi_id": "310725", "title": "Hottest day of the year: plus four other stories", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hottest-day-of-the-year-plus-four-other-stories", "creator_credit": "Jackie Cockle, Ellen Meske and Cosgrove Hall Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Episode number 4 of Series &#8220;The Animal shelf&#8221;.<br />\nFive stories are contained on this tape comprising THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE YEAR, THE WORLD IN THE WOOD, WOEFUL FLIES TO THE MOON, CAPTAIN GUMPA and THE ALARM CLOCK.

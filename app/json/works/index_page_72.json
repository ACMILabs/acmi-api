of newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>In Reel 17 the royal couple visit Ballarat (and its famous Begonia Festival) and Geelong.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 17:</p>\n<p>Opens with Title &#8220;Castlemaine&#8221;, followed by footage of children crowded onto railway station platform waving (in front of  advertisements on railway hoarding -  including Orlando Brandy, Minties and McAlpins Flour). 00:00:33:00 - 00:01:03:00 various shots of train at Castlemaine and crowds along tracks shot from moving train. 00:01:04:00 - 00:01:18:00 footage of gold mining dredge (possibly still working) shot from moving train. 00:01:19:00 Title &#8220;Ballarat Saturday, 6th. March. 1954&#8221; followed by shots of Ballarat Town Hall, decorated for the royal visit and also displaying signs for the town&#8217;s famous Begonia Festival.

of newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her husband and consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria.

It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 5 focuses on the day the Queen and Duke arrived in Melbourne, and consists mainly of short sections of footage, much of which is also seen in other Reels of this Collection.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 5:</p>\n<p>Opens with Queen and Duke leaving Parliament House.

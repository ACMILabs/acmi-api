Episode 2 &#8220;Work Around the Clock&#8221; brings us further into the women&#8217;s personal lives and how they cope with the 24 hour 7 day a week work schedual. Episode 3 &#8220;Coping with Death&#8221; explores the coping mechanisms nurses employ in a job that brings them face to face with mortality daily. Episode 4 &#8220;Is there life after Death?&#8221; questions wether the historical alignement of nurseing and spirituality are still a contemporary motivation or is does it inspire and appeal moreso to a secular humanitarianism. Nurses is not afraid of emphasising that in this profession the personal is the political. There is political undercurrent to the series and it engages sensitivly with institutional issues such the state of the Australian healthcare system, nurseing burn out rates, hospital heriarchies - particularly the status of Nurses compared to Doctors and the old saying &#8220;overworked and underpaid&#8221;. It also subtly but decidedly examines wider community concerns such as the workability of community care and issues surrounding drug abuse and community attitudes to mental health. Facts and Figures.

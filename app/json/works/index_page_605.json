From there we are taken back into the past and the film becomes a powerful examination of the tensions between artistic obsession and the realities of the commercial art world. Tim Roth&#8217;s Vincent is not &#8220;merely&#8221; heroic, the usual stereotype of a mad genius. Instead he is an obsessed artist selfishly dependent on the money sent to him by his art dealer brother, Theo (Paul Rhys). For both brothers, even though they work at opposite ends of the art industry, their commitment to art makes them blind to the damage they inflict on the world around them: Vincent allows his prostitute girlfriend to resume a life on the streets; Theo constantly allows his brother&#8217;s needs to take prominence over his responsibilities to his wife Jo (Johanna Ter Steege). But whatever the mens&#8217; failings, what remains bitterly true is the humiliation artists experience in having business people make the ultimate judgements of their work.

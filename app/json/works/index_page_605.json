An American mercenary (Clint Eastwood) rescues a nun (Shirley Maclaine) from her would-be-molesters, only to later discover that the chance meeting has been a stroke of luck for him, as she knows a great deal about the officers in the garrison he plans to invade. As they embark on a journey together, there develops a sexual tension between the two which comes to an explosive end together with the garrison under attack. Includes a musical score by Ennio Morricone.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Mexico", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Places&nbsp;→ Mexico", "Westerns"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/two-mules-for-sister-sara", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2287397, "name": "Don Siegel", "creator_id": 23467, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q358322", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2287394, "name": "Carroll Case", "creator_id": 78642, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2287392, "name": "Martin Rackin", "creator_id": 29808, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6776432", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2287391, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2287388, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44333", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1970"}], "labels": [27269], "external_references": []}]}

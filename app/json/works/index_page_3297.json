By the mid-1960s the industry had reconciliated. The French filmgoing public, and most producers, had lost their sympathy for formal experiment and unbridled self-expression. But it would be an exaggeration to argue that French cinema was essentially unchanged, and that most of the films of the late 1960s resembled those of the previous decade. Much had, in fact, been irretrievably altered. The film community was no longer closed to new talent. New directors (for example, Constantin Costa-Gavras, in 1965) and other personnel entered the industry with much greater ease than during the &#8216;Tradition of Quality&#8217;, though most of them worked on unadventurous, if occasionaly stylish, commercial projects.&#8221; Reference: Alan Williams. &#8216;Republic of images: a history of French filmmaking&#8217;.

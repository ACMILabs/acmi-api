Jarman&#8217;s experimental biography is highly theatrical, interspersing biography, soliliquies, lavish fantasy and dream sequences. The film traces Wittgenstein&#8217;s life through World War I; his career as a school-teacher and eventually as an academic at Cambridge University; to his final abandonment of classical philosophy and the development of a challenging deconstruction of language which was to bring him in conflict with more positivist philosophies. Scripted by renowned English academic, Prof. Terry Eagleton, the film revolves around a series of arguments and discussions between Wittgenstein, Betrand Russell and their academic peers. This intelligent film links abstract discourse to the politics of everyday life. In the long run, Wittgenstein&#8217;s break with the hierarchy at Cambridge is not only a product of intellectual speculation but rooted in his problematic and alienated homosexuality which could not find direct expression in the higly austere and conventional environment of &#8220;high academia&#8221;. Though this film demands rigorous attention it is also a highly stylised and beautiful exercise in the possibilities of experimental cinema.

"<p>The Charles Hayes Home Movie Collection is a collection of home movies originally made on 8mm and 9.5mm film between the 1940s and 1970s by Charles Edward Hayes (1914–1993).

The first segment is titled, &#8216;The Animals&#8217; and features the family pets including dogs, calves, cows and the audacious cockatoo named Ticka, at home in suburban Heathmont in Melbourne’s outer east.</p>\n<p>There are travel scenes of Narracan East, King River and the &#8216;Astor&#8217; motel at Albury where Charles takes some dramatic footage of the Hume Weir.

So, obviously, the plot is ridiculous - but in this camp Western pastiche that doesn&#8217;t matter at all. A gloriously delirious subverting of the western genre, &#8220;Tears of the Black Tiger&#8221; features stunning colour cinematography which announces the film&#8217;s intention to be pure artifice and celebration of cinema as fantasy. The pleasures of the film are all to be found in the art direction, the music and the photography.

She is captured by Water &amp; Power when they kill her boyfriend, kidnap her young friend, and try to blackmail her into joining their team. As a prisoner Rebecca discovers a new passion- tanks, and makes a friend with mechanic and pilot, Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), who helps her escape. Once free the girls join forces with The Rippers, an army of half men and half kangaroos, genetically modified to be the ultimate fighting machines.

Because of the importance of this 2000 years old Irrigation system to the development of Sichuan and the Yangtze River region, Li Bing became a great Chinese cultural icon, hailed as a great civil administrator and Water conservation expert. In Chinese mythology, he is known as the vanquisher of the River God, whom the people believed to have caused all the turbulent rainfalls and flooding in the Sichuan region.

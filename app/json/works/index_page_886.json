Cast includes Sarah Polley, Maury Chaykin, Peter Donaldson, Bruce Greenwood and Arsinee Khanjian.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and daughters", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Canada", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 956969, "name": "Alliance", "creator_id": 25615, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956970, "name": "Ego Film Arts", "creator_id": 22951, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956971, "name": "Camelia Frieberg", "creator_id": 77536, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956972, "name": "Atom Egoyan", "creator_id": 22952, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 956973, "name": "Atom Egoyan", "creator_id": 22952, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "45039", "production_places": [{"id": 36, "name": "Canada", "slug": "canada"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [27630]}]}

Their travels take them on a boat trip down the Li River, to the Children&#8217;s Palace in Shanghai, the Great Wall, to see the giant pandas at Beijing, Tien An Men Square, the Great Hall of the People, and finally, to meet Madame Kang Kequing, Vice Chairman of China.

They meet the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, row a surf boat, watch a parade of wild penguins, visit an outback sheep station, take part in a lesson by radio in the famous &#8220;School of the Air&#8221; and sample life in Sydney and Melbourne.

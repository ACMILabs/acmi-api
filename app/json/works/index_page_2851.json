As the years pass, each of the four women realises that she has been living out an emotionally fruitless existence. A film in which the conventions of the &#8216;woman&#8217;s weepie&#8217; are manipulated in a melodramatic schema of American class and race relations. An ironic success story, the rise of Lora (Lana Turner) from housewife to actress, in the first half, merges into intensified melodrama on the theme of race and identity as a light skinned black woman tries to pass as white. Based on the novel by Fannie Hurst.

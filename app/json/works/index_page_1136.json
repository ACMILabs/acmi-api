Drawing on the rich aesthetic and narrative veins within the audio-visual archive, a mobile and layered narrative world is created whereby the archive is not only not lost, but in fact is dramatically re-born through an examination of the sensory deprivations that make the archive so ephemeral, and the circumstances of its production so particular.</p>\n<p>Planet Usher unpacks the taken-for-granted relationship between sound and image in our everyday lives, whilst exploring their asynchronous relation in this instance as a source of emergent stories about a deaf man going blind. Planet Usher&#8217;s aural and visual aesthetic is low-tech high fidelity, evocatively rendering the degradation of memory, and more especially, of the physical senses as they are affected by Usher Syndrome. Finally, this project attempts to overlay the twin spaces and soundscapes of the domestic sphere and the metaphorical planet, thereby making the familiar alien, and the alien familiar.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ People with disabilities", "Multimedia"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2711042, "name": "Patrick Tarrant", "creator_id": 9153, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2439", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [48586]}, {"id": 108999, "acmi_id": "B1005509", "title": "Dirty Harry", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dirty-harry", "creator_credit": "Reg Boulter and Cyril Jones", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>&#8216;Harry She&#8217;llberight&#8217; is a lazy farmer, stuck in the &#8216;old ways&#8217; of chemical spraying.

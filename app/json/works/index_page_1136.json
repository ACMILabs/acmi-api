It is an unforgettable presentation of the peace loving Tom, forced to submit to a sadistic master, the evil Simon Legree. The helpless slaves are raped, tortured, humiliated and eventually driven to rebel against their oppressors. &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin&#8221; accurately depicts the attitudes of white 19th Century Americans towards the institution of slavery and dramatizes, in heart-breaking detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families sold &#8220;down the river.&#8221; It is a brutal, passionate indictment of American slavery and the explosive racial hatred that spawned it. Starring John Kitzmiller, Herbert Lom, Olivia Moorefield, Mary Ann Jensen and Prentiss Moulden.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ United States - History - Civil War, 1861-1865", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sadism in moving pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Germany", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Masochism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Sadism", "History&nbsp;→ History", "History&nbsp;→ Slavery", "History&nbsp;→ United States - History - Civil War, 1861-1865", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2149299, "name": "Géza von Radványi", "creator_id": 84535, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2149295, "name": "Kroger Babb", "creator_id": 26933, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2149291, "name": "Independent International Pictures", "creator_id": 26932, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41008", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 45, "name": "Germany (West)", "slug": "germany-west"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [24523], "external_references": []}, {"id": 80512, "acmi_id": "324524", "title": "Cry freedom", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "cry-freedom", "creator_credit": "Richard Attenborough, Universal Pictures and Marble Arch Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1987", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1987-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>The unforgettable friendship of two unforgettable men.

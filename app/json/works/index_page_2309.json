With a warm, energetic quality, and a talky, funny script, the film regales the audience with memorable characters and hilarious scenarios.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adulthood", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Dating (Social customs)", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Adulthood", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Actors", "Places&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/swingers", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2320999, "name": "Doug Liman", "creator_id": 35887, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q349339", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2320998, "name": "Victor Simpkins", "creator_id": 35886, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q91102833", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2320992, "name": "Independent Pictures", "creator_id": 71714, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2320993, "name": "Miramax Films", "creator_id": 22633, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2320989, "name": "Magna Pacific", "creator_id": 80556, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51822", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [33472]}, {"id": 93959, "acmi_id": "317719", "title": "The Wizard of Oz [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-wizard-of-oz-dvd", "creator_credit": "Victor Fleming, Mervyn LeRoy and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1939", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1939-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 43755, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q193695"}], "brief_description": "<p>This 50th Anniversary Commemorative Edition of the &#8220;Wizard of Oz&#8221; is as it was originally released in 1939, including the Kansas scenes in warm sepia tones.

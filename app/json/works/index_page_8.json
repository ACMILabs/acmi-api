It stars Arrernte actress Rosalie Kunoth-Monks (credited as Ngarla Kunoth) as Jedda and Tiwi actor Robert Tudawali as Marbuck. Due to the film&#8217;s popularity, and a rising interest in Aboriginal &#8216;kitsch&#8217; and culture, Kunoth-Monks and Jedda became entwined. But unlike Tudawali, who had other roles, Kunoth-Monks never acted again and became an advocate for Australia&#8217;s First Peoples. Cast also includes Betty Suttor, Paul Reynall, George Simpson-Lytle, Tas Fitzer, Wason Byers, Willie Farrar, and Margaret Dingle</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Attitudes", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Children", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Ethnic identity", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians in motion pictures", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Australia - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures, Australian", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jedda-the-uncivilized", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2048476, "name": "Charles Chauvel", "creator_id": 66792, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q453792", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2048475, "name": "Charles Chauvel Productions", "creator_id": 66791, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q453792", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2048474, "name": "Smart Street Films", "creator_id": 22349, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53232", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1955", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1955"}], "labels": [34676], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92229, "acmi_id": "315456", "title": "Glimpses of Australia.

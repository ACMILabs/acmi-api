The program&#8217;s style makes the avant-garde accessible and provides an insight into a vibrant underground city culture. In this episode Andrew investigates ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) at Federation Square three weeks before its opening. Not only is the functionality and architecture discussed of ACMI&#8217;s new home, but Andrew, through interviews with Victoria Lyn and Alessio Cavallaro, also discovers ACMI&#8217;s history and its expanded role in the future world of the moving image through its innovative upcoming programs such as &#8220;Deep Space&#8221; and &#8220;Pathways&#8221;. This is followed by an in depth look at the &#8220;Kiss my Art&#8221; public program, a collaboration between shop traders and artists, curated by Antonia Chaffey. Shows interviews with Lissa Watt (artist - Club-X), Anne-Marie Power (artist - Franco Cozzo), Robyn Carretti, Roland Smith (video artist) and finishes off with a piece by video artist Angus Wyatt called &#8220;Success&#8221; from the &#8220;(trans)actions/(plat)forms for alterity&#8221; Exhibition at the Gertrude Contemporary Art Space.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:24:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Australian Centre for the Moving Image", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Exhibitions", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art galleries", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 21st century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artistic collaboration", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Australian Centre for the Moving Image", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Avant-garde (Aesthetics)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Installations (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Modernism (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Public art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2233524, "name": "Andrew MacKenzie", "creator_id": 35814, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315176", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2233522, "name": "Independent", "creator_id": 76657, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51763", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33417]}]}

The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke.</p>\n<p>In this film, the filmmaker shows life on and around the beach at Anglesea in Victoria - walking, hang gliding, surfing, motoring in the dunes and on the sand, taking in the views from the cliffs. Wallace focuses on examples of coastal wildflowers as well as animal life where he finds it.</p>\n<p>Originally made using Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:06:46:00 hikers

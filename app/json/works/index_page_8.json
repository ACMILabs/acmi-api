The students in <i>What Do We Want?</i> become a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>The work loudly and proudly conveys the diversity of First Nations peoples, and the ongoing fight for justice that unifies them, raising urgent questions that require action and response.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Director: Reko Rennie</p>\n<p>Produced by Film Camp, Philippa Campey, Molly O&#8217;Connor</p>\n<p>Original composition by A.B.

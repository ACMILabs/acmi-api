Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film, titled ‘Orchid Isle’, is the second of two parts capturing the filmmaker’s travels in Fiji.

Lou’s research project ‘Sovereign Language Rematriation Through Song Pedagogy’ focusses on the importance and relevance of Indigenous language retrieval, reclamation, and regeneration through the medium of the Arts to enhance community health and wellbeing. Dr Romaine Moreton is an artist, writer, performer, filmmaker, and her proposes an Indigenous philosophy of story-telling and embodied knowledge, with her work constantly drawing our attention back to the importance of the breath in Indigenous cultural practices.</p>\n<p>The making of Jaara Nyilamum (2021) evoked a stillness that restored us to full sensual immersion within country, and from this place of rooted calmness, country reaffirmed our Law is real. Jaara Nyilamum became most profound when we realised this was more than a film about ceremony, but was in fact, ceremony itself.

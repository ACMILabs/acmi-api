Moon is a survivor and although he acts cool and mean, can also show compassion and tenderness, particularly for the under-dog as in the case of Sylvester (Wenbers Li), a mentally handicapped friend whom he zealously protects from bullying gangs and Ping (Neiky Yim), the daughter of one of his debtors, who is suffering from a fatal kidney disease and who Moon soon finds himself falling for. A young schoolgirl&#8217;s suicide will inextricably link the lives of Moon, Sylvester and Ping taking them down a sad and tragic path of despair and violence but one begins to empathise with Moon along this journey as he tries to protect those he loves. Gritty, tender, violent, comic, &#8220;Made in Hong Kong&#8221; is film noir in style with Moon acting as narrator throughout the story but it is also expressionistic visually, using strobe, overexposure, freeze-frames, and jump-cutting, adding depth and enhancement to Chan&#8217;s debut film. Cast also includes Amy Tam, Carol Lam, Doris Chow, Wu Wai-chung. In Mandarin with English subtitles.

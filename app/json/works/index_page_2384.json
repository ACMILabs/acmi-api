Detective Ray Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is an Atlantic City cop, willing to take a bribe, dreaming of being on television, and always getting results. He meets his long time friend, Navy Commander Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), ringside, at a heavyweight bought signalling the swan song of the Atlantic City arena, where they, along with thousands of spectators witness the political assassination of the U.S Secretary of Defence. The stadium is shut down as Santoro leads the investigation, searching for a mysterious woman (Carla Gugion) seen speaking to the secretary shortly before he was killed. Dunne, meanwhile, is taking credit for locating the shooter, a Palestinian fall guy. As Santoro finds his witness, he learns of a conspiracy involving the Norfolk testing and learns the shocking truth about his friend. With state of the art surveillance equipment in the stadium, all eyes are watching proceeding and nothing can escape detection. When the truth is finally revealed, Santoro is forced to question his loyalty to Dunne, and whether he will live up to his reputation as a corrupt cop.

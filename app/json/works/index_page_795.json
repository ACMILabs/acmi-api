This film presents two newsreels produced by two different companies as they appeared in the cinemas on 30th March, 1939, each giving a scant coverage of world political events, and social and sporting events on the home scene. Useful to compare the coverage of events in the two newsreels as well as comparing the newsreel with today&#8217;s television news coverage. Suitable for middle and upper secondary levels.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:47:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Journalism - Political aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture journalism", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture theaters", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - History", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Social aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures in propaganda", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television broadcasting of news", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Archival materials", "Archival, Cinemagazines & Newsreels&nbsp;→ Newsreels - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communication - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Journalism - Political aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Mass media - Political aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Motion pictures in propaganda", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Political science", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social influence", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social role", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social values", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ World politics", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Social role", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion picture theaters", "Television"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 887917, "name": "Honley Film Services", "creator_id": 38622, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "56118", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1976", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1976"}], "labels": [37386]}, {"id": 70886, "acmi_id": "007599", "title": "The News", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-news", "creator_credit": "Norbert Mai and Ifage Filmproduktion (DE)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1965", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Explains how news is gathered and disseminated in Germany.

But the experiment goes wrong and our heroes find themselves awoken (53 years later) by a post-nuclear society containing only women - who hate men. This slapstick comedy rather than implying any feminist critique pokes fun at totalitarianism, ironic in that the first-time director, Juliusz Machulski, made this film using state money in a communist country under martial law. A hilarious film that pokes fun at the values of the day by talking about tomorrow and borrows much of its stylings from films such as &#8220;Barbarella&#8221;, &#8220;The Sleeper&#8221; and thematically from films like &#8220;1984&#8221; and &#8220;Fahrenheit 451.&#8221;</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:56:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["Polish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Slapstick comedies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Totalitarianism", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Poland", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ Science fiction", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Low temperature engineering"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995912, "name": "Juliusz Machulski", "creator_id": 79786, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995911, "name": "Polish Corporation for Film Production", "creator_id": 25378, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49828", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 44, "name": "Poland", "slug": "poland"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1983", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1983"}], "labels": [31870], "external_references": []}, {"id": 92377, "acmi_id": "315635", "title": "The Last stage = Ostatni etap [NTSC]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-stage-ostatni-etap-ntsc", "creator_credit": "Wanda Jakubowska, Mieczyslaw Weiberger and Film Polski", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Poland, 1948", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1948-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Jakubowska, associated with progressive left-wing groups before the war, survived Auschwitz to collaborate with Schneider, a fellow prisoner, on this film based on German records, memoirs of fellow prisoners and their own memories.

It is also Coppola&#8217;s most anguished and personal film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Film noir", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2340467, "name": "Francis Ford Coppola", "creator_id": 503, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q56094", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2340463, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2340456, "name": "Zoetrope Studios", "creator_id": 23023, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2340451, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37935", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1974", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1974"}], "labels": [21538], "external_references": []}]}

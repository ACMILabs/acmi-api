He rationalises that this will allow him to channel his energy into his career and hobbies, which in turn will help him to forget about sex. However, his resolve is soon put to the test when he meets the gorgeous body-builder Steve (Michael T. Weiss) while working out at the gym. Torn between wanting to ravish Steve and wanting to maintain his celibacy, Jeffrey turns to his best friend Sterling (Patrick Stewart) for advice.

Seeking the advice of Sterling and his partner Darius, a post-modern evangelist, a self-help group, his liberal parents, and a randy Catholic priest, Jeffrey struggles to come to terms with the concept that a life lived in fear is no life at all. Features a variety of cameos from stars such as Sigourney Weaver, Camryn Manheim, Olympia Dukakis, Kathy Najimy, Christine Baranski, and Nathan Lane.

While these jokes may seem throw-away moments of internet culture, they, like others referencing his recent divorce, use humour and absurdity to bring Bezos back down to earth. And the backlash isn’t only against the Amazon founder, but also Richard Branson and Elon Musk, billionaires jostling to beat each other into the stratosphere in a space race that exposes how massive corporations and individuals now possess the resources to do what was once reserved for Cold War superpowers. While Bezos timed the launch on the anniversary of the 1969 Moon landing, many Twitter users noted the disparity between that globally unifying moment and the disillusionment of watching a man who could end poverty take an intergalactic joyride.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Jeff Bezos post-launch brief</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Ben Norton</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>USA, 22 Jul 2021</p>", "description": "<p><b>This video features in a responsive display in the museum that presents the moments, stories and memes capturing the zeitgeist by going viral on the internet.</b></p>\n<p>Following Jeff Bezos&#8217; launch into space on the New Shephard rocket ship, the billionaire took a moment to thank those who had made it possible.

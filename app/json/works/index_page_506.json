Filmed in the high-rise projects of Nanterre, this film is an uncompromising look at the life of young people eking a living at the edge of society. By its choice of topic and its stylistic, this film is at odds with the mainstream of the 1960s cinematographic production. Other artists and technicians credited: Maurice Dugowson, Serge Gainsbourg.

his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, Billy travels to Japan, Tahiti, New York and Funchal in Portugal.

own way.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Leon Holt and Ian Jackson. Archival video reproduced courtesy of Hampden FNL, Swifts Creek FC and Dawn Teasdale.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT:  I got to meet Fizz through junior football. Fizz used to cart me around everywhere and play footy. And then one thing led to another and I developed into seniors, and Fizz was a senior umpire in the North Central League. And so Fizz umpired quite a few games when I was a young fellow playing.</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t actually get to see Fizz play. But if you listen to the storytellers around Wedderburn, they say Fizz didn&#8217;t mind dishing a little bit out, being a rover and being small, got that small man syndrome.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>IAN &#8220;FIZZ&#8221; JACKSON:  Yeah, I was a very fiery player. I was very tough and very fiery. But when I give it up, I thought, I went back and I just changed the attitude all over. And I thought, well, I&#8217;ve got to be a lot different from what I was as a player.</p>\n<p>I started in 1974, 28 years of umpiring. I umpired 560 games, and I&#8217;ve done at least 20 Grand Finals.</p>\n<p>[MAN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done all those games without any reports. I&#8217;ve sent people off and I&#8217;ve warned people. I&#8217;d rather give them a 50-meter or talk to them than things like that. Because I thought that was a lot easier. Because well, I got more respect by doing that than reporting. That&#8217;s the way I looked at it.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>LEON HOLT: Fizz was always on the side of the bloke that hit second, because he thought the bloke that hit second had a reason to hit. So the bloke that hit first was always in trouble with Fizz.

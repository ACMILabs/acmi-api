Renowned for pushing his body to its limits through durational performance, body modification and surgical enhancement, Stelarc has established a decades-long practice that explores the intersection between the human body and technology, proposing a post-human understanding of the world. This unique archive of video and photographic documentation spans the artist’s early hook suspensions and internal body probes to performances with a robotic third arm and experiments in virtual realities.</p>\n<p>The collection is housed on a variety of formats used since the introduction of video in the 1970s, including reel-to-reel tape, VHS, U-Matic, SP Betacam and Mini DV. These variable formats are currently being digitised to ensure the preservation and legacy of the artist’s archive.</p>\n<p>The Stelarc Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the artist through the Cultural Gifts Program.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1337583, "name": "Stelarc", "creator_id": 8996, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 119222, "acmi_id": "B2004079", "title": "[Stelarc: Stretched Skin No.4 Munich 1977]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-stretched-skin-no4-munich-1977", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Munich/Germany, 1977", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1977-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 118261, "acmi_id": "B2003948", "title": "[Stelarc: The Third Hand Tokyo 1981]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-the-third-hand-tokyo-1981", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1981", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": true, "first_production_date": "1981-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "173786", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1970s-2000s Decade", "notes": "", "to_year": "1970s-2000s Decade"}], "labels": [58688]}, {"id": 119221, "acmi_id": "B2004064", "title": "[Stelarc: Event for Modified Man 1976]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "stelarc-event-for-modified-man-1976", "creator_credit": "Stelarc", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Tokyo/Japan, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This video is documentation of a performance entitled &#8220;Modulate / Meditate: Event for Modified Man&#8221; held at Tamura Gallery in Tokyo, Japan, from 26 January to 1 February 1976.</p>\n<p>In this durational performance, Stelarc has hooks inserted into his back and sews first his lips and then his eyelids closed with a needle and thread.

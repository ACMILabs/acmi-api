Convinced that Solange has tired of him, he convinces a stranger, Stephan (Patrick Dewaere), to enter a menage-a-trois with himself and Solange. However, no matter how hard they try, no matter how much love they offer Solange, they are unable to bring a smile to her face or make her fall pregnant (which they believe is all that she really needs). A trip away to a summer camp leads to Solange meeting the precocious Christian, a thirteen year old boy with the IQ of a genius.

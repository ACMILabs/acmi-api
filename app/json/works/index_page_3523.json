In turn satire, tragedy and gothic comedy, Citizen Kane is a triumph of disjointed, non-linear narrative in which the form becomes the theme, an ironic reflection upon the success ethic and the crushing weight of materialism. In drawing upon the tradition of classical narrative, while at the same time violating some of the expectations in the viewer&#8217;s reception of such narrative, Welles ultimately assured &#8220;Citizen Kane&#8221; of its place as a watershed in modern cinema. Credits: script-Herman J. Mankiewicz, Orson Welles; music-Bernard Hermann; photography-Gregg Toland; editors-Robert Wise, Mark Robson. Cast includes: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Expressionism in motion pictures", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Satire", "Drama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 862081, "name": "Mercury Productions", "creator_id": 66875, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 862082, "name": "Orson Welles", "creator_id": 66876, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 862083, "name": "Gregg Toland", "creator_id": 75679, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 862084, "name": "Robert Wise", "creator_id": 43538, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 862085, "name": "Bernard Herrmann", "creator_id": 75680, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 862086, "name": "Orson Welles", "creator_id": 66876, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 862087, "name": "Joseph Cotten", "creator_id": 75681, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 862088, "name": "Dorothy Comingore", "creator_id": 75682, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "31745", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1941", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1941"}], "labels": [15478]}, {"id": 79537, "acmi_id": "300489", "title": "Citizen Kane", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "citizen-kane", "creator_credit": "Orson Welles", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1941", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1941-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Shrouded in darkness and fog is the huge mansion called Xanadu.

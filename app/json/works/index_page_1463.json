Following the example of Marcel Pagnol, Renoir completely abandoned the studio and filmed exclusively outdoors and in genuine interiors in the Midi, using authentic sound and actors from the region. The film is remarkable for its avoidance of the melodramatic, the depth and fluidity of the camerawork and the feeling for figures in a landscape.

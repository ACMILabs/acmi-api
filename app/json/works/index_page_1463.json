While Father Kiernan struggles to present his case to high-ranking Vatican official Cardinal Houseman (Jonathon Pryce), in another town and another country, vivacious Pittsburgh hairdresser Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) is shown living a life of decadent abandon.

Suddenly, her life is turned upside down as she begins to experience violent, unexpected attacks that cause her to bleed profusely from her wrists.

As children grow, they learn both by experience and by imitation; parents and teachers have to decide when it is better to interfere and when it is better to let children find out for themselves in their own way. This film presents a number of situations in which children and their learning processes raise problems which parents and teachers encounter from day to day, and suggestions are made as to how these problems can be solved. This is one of a series of films which includes &#8220;Your children and you&#8221;, &#8220;Your children&#8217;s sleep&#8221;, &#8220;Your children&#8217;s meals&#8221; and &#8220;Children growing up with other people&#8221;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:31:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Ephemeral films", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Learning ability", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Learning ability - Testing", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Learning, Psychology o", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School children", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Assertiveness in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Child development", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Child psychology", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Growth", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Perception in children", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ School children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Behaviorism (Psychology)", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child development", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Child psychology", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Children - Growth", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Decision-making", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mental hygiene", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Perception in children", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ School children", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1819213, "name": "John Taylor", "creator_id": 12648, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 738287, "name": "Realist Films", "creator_id": 13295, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 738289, "name": "Margaret Thomson", "creator_id": 13751, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Preservation Print (Section 5)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "21631", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1947", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1947"}], "labels": [5519], "external_references": []}, {"id": 66029, "acmi_id": "001988", "title": "Children learn from filmstrips", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "children-learn-from-filmstrips", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Richard Gilbert, Frank Spiller and Stanley Jackson", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1963", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1963-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Illustrates the value of audio-visual instruction in primary schools.

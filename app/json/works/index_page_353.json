Cast includes: Andrew McCarthy, Mary Stuart Masterson, Kevin Dillon, Malcom Danare, Donald Sutherland, John Heard and Patrick Dempsey.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:39:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Teen films", "Comedy", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ School discipline", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adolescence", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993689, "name": "Michael Dinner", "creator_id": 31347, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993688, "name": "Mark Carliner", "creator_id": 77905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993687, "name": "Dan Wigutow", "creator_id": 79130, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993686, "name": "Silver Screen Partners", "creator_id": 22848, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46480", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [28902], "external_references": []}]}

Carmela (Carmen Maura - &#8220;Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown&#8221; 1987) and Paulino (Andres Pajares) along with the mute Gustavete (Gabino Diego) have been travelling on the road entertaining frontline Republican troops under the banner of the Tip-Top Variety Show. Carmela sings and dances, Paulino recites poetry and Gustavete plays guitar and together they perform and act out short comedic scenes and entertain in the true vaudevillian tradition. However when they are captured by Mussolini&#8217;s soldiers on their way to Valencia, choices have to be made. Morality, loyalty, survival are put to the test for Carmela and Paulino, both on a personal and artist&#8217;s level. Will they resist, or co-operate with the demands put on them to perform for the Fascist officers and a group of captured Polish prisoners who are doomed to be executed the morning after the show? And what about the Italian Lieutenant who is in charge of producing/directing the show - can Carmela and Paulino agree to the changes in the words of their songs and poetry to reflect the fascist ideology? Will they compromise themselves to save their own lives? &#8220;Ay Carmela&#8221; is a strange blend of farcical comedy, music, dance, and politics and may prove a disappointment to Carlos Saura fans (director of Carmen and Blood Wedding). However, Carmen Maura puts in an excellent performance as does Andres Pajares and the theme of artists and morality is an interesting one.

Bedlam, written by Lewton under a pseudonym and inspired by William Hogarth&#8217;s satirical series of engravings entitled, &#8220;A Rakes&#8217;s Progress&#8221; (1735), represents a marked shift away from the sensationalist b-movies he produced in the early 40&#8217;s , and was his last offering in the horror genre before his death in 1951. Cast includes Boris Karloff, Anna Lee.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>A dramatic and sinister psychodrama from horror film producer Val Lewton, who was also responsible for bringing classics such as &#8220;Cat people&#8221; (1942), &#8220;The Leopard man&#8221; (1943), &#8220;The Ghost ship&#8221; (1943), &#8220;The Body snatcher&#8221; (1945) and &#8220;Isle of the dead&#8221; (1945) to the big screen. In 18th century London, paradoxically named the Age of Reason by the people, a popular past-time for upper classes was to visit St. Mary&#8217;s of Bethlehem Asylum - &#8220;Bedlam&#8221; - to observe its &#8220;loonies&#8221;. After the death of a young poet attempting to escape Bedlam leaves the wealthy Lord Mortimer without a commissioned play, the sinister head of the Asylum, Master George Sims, steps in and offers to stage a mask performed by the inmates of his Asylum. Intrigued, Mortimer&#8217;s young protege Mistress Nell Bowen decides to pay the Asylum a visit, but becomes rapidly disgusted and offended by Sims&#8217; brutal and sadistic treatment of the inmates. With advice from Quaker stonemason William Hannay, she resolves to stop the mistreatment and bring about reform. However, her plans go awry when Sims manages to turn Lord Mortimer against her, and then has her committed to Bedlam. Shunned by those whom she once called friends, Nell finds friendship and hope among the tortured souls imprisoned in the madhouse, and her quest to reform the system becomes more urgent. However, the inmates have their own ideas about reform, and justice is served to their cruel tormentor in a most macabre manner, in a scene lifted from Edgar Allen Poe. Fascinating to note is that one of the reasons given as to why a particular inmate was confined, was due to his desire to create &#8216;moving pictures&#8217;.

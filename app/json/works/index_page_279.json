an undisclosed mathematical formula that has a huge monetary potential for the company he works at. However, his boss is unwilling to discuss the personal bonus Joe believes he has coming to him. While on a business trip to the Caribbean, he runs into Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), a mysterious, rich stranger who offers him a few tips on life and business. This meeting marks the beginning of his spiral into a labyrinthine world of shady characters, plot twists and surprise reversals, where nothing is what it appears to be and nobody can be trusted. As in &#8220;House of Games&#8221; (1987), Mamet&#8217;s first film as a director, the elaborate con game visited on the innocent victim in &#8220;The Spanish Prisoner&#8221; completely shatters their sense of equilibrium. Trust proves Joe&#8217;s undoing, faith in humanity his tragic flaw. As with many other of Mamet&#8217;s films, an underlying theme running throughout the film is that of the immorality of the corporate world that rewards those who act ruthlessly and punishes those who hold to a code of ethics.

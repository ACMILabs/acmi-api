The pacifist captain (Klaus Maria Brandauer), is a German-American who is haunted by an event in his naval past when he was indirectly responsible for the deaths at sea of some sailors during WWII. When he rescues a drifting speedboat from an impending storm, he is confronted by a trio of modern day pirates led by the menacing, psychotic Caspary (played in a no-holds-barred performance by Robert Duvall), on their way to pick up illicit cargo. From the moment they board the lightship the thugs attempt to take control, resulting in a violent struggle between good and evil. With the atmosphere becoming increasingly tense and hostile, conflicts arise amongst the crew as their misguided attempts at heroism end tragically.

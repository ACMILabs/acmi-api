Tony Collingwood)- a lovely young lady, named Mayzie, discovers a daisy growing out the top of her head. Her schoolteachers and townsfolk are thrown into a flap about what to do with poor Mayzie, who learns a lesson about the perils of fame and money, and the importance of family. &#8220;Horton hatches the egg&#8221; (prod. Leon Schlesinger, dir. Robert Clampett) - Horton, a kind-hearted elephant, agrees to sit on an unhatched egg for a mother bird named Maisy, who is in need of a holiday. When the lazy Maisy decides she likes it too much at the beach, the ever-faithful Horton sits on the egg through thick and thin, determined to hatch it safely, despite bad weather and the ridicule of his friends. These animated tales, imbued with gentle humour, and the rhyming prose of Dr Seuss, should prove a delight to children.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animals", "Animation", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 0-6", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children", "Literature&nbsp;→ Parables", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 252209, "name": "Turner Network Television", "creator_id": 24880, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 252210, "name": "Tony Collingwood Productions", "creator_id": 22393, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 252211, "name": "Warner Bros", "creator_id": 7157, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51816", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [33466], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94087, "acmi_id": "317859", "title": "The Best of Dad's army.

The program celebrates the excesses of the reality television genre and delivers the ultimate promise to would-be-voyeurs by filming it&#8217;s &#8216;contestants&#8217; constantly for the duration of the show (with the help of 23 cameras). The program, run as a winner takes-all competition, placed twelve strangers in a house (six girls and six boys) to live with each other for a period of three months (85 days). A set of rules were put in place, along with a number of set tasks (or challenges) that had to be completed (or performed) by the house-mates. Each week a house-mate would be voted off by the public from the show, whilst the competition grew and the public interest intensified to a dramatic climax that revealed the final winner. Relive the fun, drama, screams, precocious parading and much un-scripted antics of the original twelve that dared show us all how they could cope under 24 hour surveillance! Hosted by Greta Kileen.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Nudity", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Reality television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television - Psychological aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television advertising", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television and youth", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television broadcasting - Social aspects", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television comedies - Australia", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television personalities", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Television series", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Comedy", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Nudity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Reality", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Television broadcasting - Social aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Nudity", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Competition (Psychology)", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television comedies&nbsp;→ Television comedies - Australia", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Reality television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Australia", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 913100, "name": "Southern Star Entertainment", "creator_id": 26294, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913101, "name": "Endemol Entertainment", "creator_id": 30789, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913102, "name": "Lara Hopkins", "creator_id": 80118, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913103, "name": "Andrew Farrell", "creator_id": 80119, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 913104, "name": "Simon Francis", "creator_id": 34724, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50579", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [32565], "external_references": []}]}

Their peace is shattered however when two seemingly nice young men arrive at their door and begin a series of cruel and violent games which culminate in torture and murder. Austrian director Michael Haneke directed a trilogy of films in the 1990s, (&#8220;The Seventh Continent&#8221;, &#8220;71 Fragments for a Chronology of Chance&#8221; and &#8220;Benny&#8217;s Video&#8221;) which all examined the relationship between violence, crime, media and class.

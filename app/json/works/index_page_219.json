His life is continually surrounded by plots and conspiracies from those who have ulterior motives as to who Henry should marry. Donald Pleasence puts in an excellent performance as Thomas Cromwell and Keith Michell is truly magnificent as Henry VIII as he physically changes from a proud young man to a quite obese and gout-ridden lonely old man. The six wives are played equally as well by Frances Cuka (Catharine of Aragon), Charlotte Rampling (Anne Boleyn), Jane Asher (Jane Seymour), Jenny Bos (Anne of Cleves), Lynne Frederick (Catharine Howard) and Barbara Leigh-Hunt (Catharine Parr).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ Anne Boleyn, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England, 1507-1536", "History&nbsp;→ Anne of Cleves, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England", "History&nbsp;→ Catharine Howard, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, d. 1542", "History&nbsp;→ Catharine Parr, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, 1512-1548", "History&nbsp;→ Catharine of Aragon, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, 1485-1536", "History&nbsp;→ England - History", "History&nbsp;→ Henry VIII, King of England, 1491-1547", "History&nbsp;→ Jane Seymour, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England, 1509-1537", "History&nbsp;→ Monarchy - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ English drama - Early modern and Elizabethan, 1500-1600", "People&nbsp;→ Anne Boleyn, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England, 1507-1536", "People&nbsp;→ Anne of Cleves, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England", "People&nbsp;→ Catharine Howard, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, d. 1542", "People&nbsp;→ Catharine Parr, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, 1512-1548", "People&nbsp;→ Catharine of Aragon, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, 1485-1536", "People&nbsp;→ Henry VIII, King of England, 1491-1547", "People&nbsp;→ Jane Seymour, Queen, Consort of Henry VIII, King of England, 1509-1537"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997002, "name": "Waris Hussein", "creator_id": 34733, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997001, "name": "Roy Baird", "creator_id": 34505, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997000, "name": "Anglo-EMI Productions", "creator_id": 34732, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996999, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50585", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1972", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1972"}], "labels": [32569], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93065, "acmi_id": "316426", "title": "A Streetcar named desire", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "a-streetcar-named-desire", "creator_credit": "John Erman, Marc Trabulus and Keith Barish Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1983", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1983-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Blanche Dubois, a faded Southern belle whose fortunes have crumbled to nothing, comes to New Orleans to stay with her sister, Stella.

We first see Trevor, a 16-year-old neo-Nazi, strutting through the halls of a local magistrate to the thrashing sounds of punk rock band, The Exploited. Trevor walks with total defiance, anger and resolve toward the courtroom, where he is reprimanded for various acts of theft and vandalism. But he is totally indifferent and brazen toward all authority. Trevor is society&#8217;s worst nightmare. In a scene at the local &#8216;assessment centre&#8217; where he is sent because the court is unable to imprison him, a superintendent describes with shocking accuracy Trevor&#8217;s past and future options: he barely attended school and was constantly reprimanded; he engaged in criminal activities from an early age; he was court marshalled then sent to an &#8216;assessment&#8217; centre; and from here it&#8217;s likely he will be unemployed and on the dole, leading to further theft and finally, at the end of the road, prison. Social worker, Harry Parker, believes that Trevor is in fact an intelligent young man who could be reformed with the right guidance and support. But what he miscalculates is Trevor&#8217;s unique psychological makeup: not only is he completely anti-society, the more society attempts to strap him down, the more his anger is fuelled. Perhaps the most terrifying aspect of Clarke&#8217;s portrait of young Trevor is that his neo-Nazism is in fact a logical extension of Britain&#8217;s colonial history: hence Trevor could only be &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221;.

Trevor walks with total defiance, anger and resolve toward the courtroom, where he is reprimanded for various acts of theft and vandalism. But he is totally indifferent and brazen toward all authority. Trevor is society&#8217;s worst nightmare. In a scene at the local &#8216;assessment centre&#8217; where he is sent because the court is unable to imprison him, a superintendent describes with shocking accuracy Trevor&#8217;s past and future options: he barely attended school and was constantly reprimanded; he engaged in criminal activities from an early age; he was court marshalled then sent to an &#8216;assessment&#8217; centre; and from here it&#8217;s likely he will be unemployed and on the dole, leading to further theft and finally, at the end of the road, prison. Social worker, Harry Parker, believes that Trevor is in fact an intelligent young man who could be reformed with the right guidance and support. But what he miscalculates is Trevor&#8217;s unique psychological makeup: not only is he completely anti-society, the more society attempts to strap him down, the more his anger is fuelled. Perhaps the most terrifying aspect of Clarke&#8217;s portrait of young Trevor is that his neo-Nazism is in fact a logical extension of Britain&#8217;s colonial history: hence Trevor could only be &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221;. A tight script by David Leland, an outstanding performance by Tim Roth and tight, precise editing makes this film an unforgettable viewing experience.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>An example of Alan Clarke&#8217;s TV work from the &#8216;70s and &#8216;80s, &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221; is, from the first frame, sheer cinematic force. We first see Trevor, a 16-year-old neo-Nazi, strutting through the halls of a local magistrate to the thrashing sounds of punk rock band, The Exploited.

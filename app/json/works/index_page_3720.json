To Lucja, holding the family together was paramount. For her sons, it was the fight for an independent Poland, free of Nazi Germany control, and a total commitment to the Communist Party. However, at the end of the war with a new regime in Poland, another form of persecution began to take place. Instead of freedom and peace, the 1950s became a time of fear, when friend betrayed friend and former heroes of the independence struggle were jailed as traitors - a time of expedient political trials, torture and even death. It is during this time that Klemens (Boguslaw Linda) Lucja&#8217;s son, is inexplicably arrested and accused of being a collaborator. His eventual fate is never revealed to Lucja. A stark film of harsh reality portraying a time of political upheaval and uncertainty in Poland. &#8220;Mother of kings&#8221; was shelved for five years until 1987 when censorship restrictions became more relaxed in communist Poland.

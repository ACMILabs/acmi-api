This heightening (a kind of &#8216;madness&#8217;) is achieved through mise en scene: a sense of cultural decadence (the glossy surfaces of middle America) is played off against emotionalism, innocent energy deflected by the emergence of conscience. Originally filmed in Technicolor with lavish cinematography by Russell Metty. Based on the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas. Cast includes Jane Wyman, Rock Hudson, Barbara Rush, Agnes Moorehead and Otto Kruger.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 812249, "name": "Douglas Sirk", "creator_id": 32253, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q60858", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1803954, "name": "Ross Hunter", "creator_id": 78126, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2754518", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 812247, "name": "Universal International Pictures", "creator_id": 61194, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50133", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1954", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1954"}], "labels": [32134]}, {"id": 95894, "acmi_id": "502434", "title": "Magnets for beginners", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "magnets-for-beginners", "creator_credit": "Coronet Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Shows what materials magnets attract, what a magnetic field is, what poles are, and how magnetic force can pass through objects.

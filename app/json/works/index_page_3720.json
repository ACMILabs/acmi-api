Cast includes Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Closed captioning", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Brainwashing", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Memory", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Mind control", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychoanalysis", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychologists", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 964880, "name": "Michel Gondry", "creator_id": 68267, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964879, "name": "Anthony Bregman", "creator_id": 68278, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964878, "name": "Steve Golin", "creator_id": 68280, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 964877, "name": "Focus Features", "creator_id": 68244, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 964876, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20449, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/5MwkWH9tYHv3mV9OdYTMR5qreIz.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind (Michel Gondry) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53053", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [34501]}, {"id": 87836, "acmi_id": "44429", "title": "Eternal children", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "eternal-children", "creator_credit": "Don Haldane, David Bairstow and National Film Board of Canada", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1959", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1959-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Children who through heredity, brain injury or various other causes are not equipped to keep pace in a competitive world - are they to be society&#8217;s unwitting castaways?

From those early beginnings the Melbourne-based festival now attracts interstate and international guests and covers a wide variety of arts<br />\nperformances including outdoor events such as the Annual Parade in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy, the Annual Waiter&#8217;s Race, street-theatre and live bands and indoor events including comedy and cabaret, music and theatre. The Fringe Furniture Exhibition allows for young students<br />\nand designers an opportunity to show-off their creative ability and caters for non-mainstream pieces.

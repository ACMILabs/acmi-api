Joffe and Woody Allen</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United States, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Loosely based upon the book by David R. Reuben, this Woody Allen classic answers some of the timeless (and tasteless) questions about society&#8217;s oldest taboo: sex. It consists of a series of vignettes, one of which has Gene Wilder experiencing a woolly love affair with a sheep, and another has Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds showing an unorthodox view of sex - from the inside out. Woody Allen once said about sex: &#8220;It&#8217;s the most fun I&#8217;ve ever had without laughing.&#8221; Allen&#8217;s confronting style may not sit well with all viewers - you may find yourself squirming uncomfortably in your seat at some of the scenes - and it may not be everything you always wanted to know about sex, but as a comedy it&#8217;s everything you&#8217;ve always known about Woody Allen.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Loosely based upon the book by David R.

Rated PG. &#8220;Heathens&#8221; (directed by Megan Spencer), confirms that there are really passionate and vitriolic supporters out there as director Megan Spencer follows St Kilda supporters with names like Thommo and Chook. Watch out for the language, which is alot more colourful than the red white and black. Rated R, for reasons which become very apparent from the first five seconds.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mateship", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Australian football"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 1427586, "name": "Siren Videos", "creator_id": 77967, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "43588", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 2000", "notes": "release (via NFSA)", "to_year": "c. 2000"}], "labels": [26654], "external_references": []}, {"id": 114756, "acmi_id": "S00316", "title": "Game Activities", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "game-activities", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Unknown", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Game Activities</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Unknown</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 73549, "acmi_id": "010645", "title": "Teaching game activities to intermediate children (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "teaching-game-activities-to-intermediate-children-tefc", "creator_credit": "George Longstaff and Burbank Audio Visual", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00"}, {"id": 73550, "acmi_id": "010646", "title": "Teaching games to primary children (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "teaching-games-to-primary-children-tefc", "creator_credit": "Sherry Fulton and Burbank Audio Visual", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "57895", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 179, "name": "Unknown", "slug": "unknown"}], "production_dates": [], "labels": [54250], "external_references": []}, {"id": 77476, "acmi_id": "015738", "title": "Gambling with our lives", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gambling-with-our-lives", "creator_credit": "United Nations and Joe O'Brien", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Modern technology provides us with an ever improving standard of living.

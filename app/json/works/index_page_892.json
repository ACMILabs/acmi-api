The eight men (who don&#8217;t know each other) treat the assignment like a reconnaissance mission, carefully planned under the leadership of Colonel Hyde. &#8220;The League of gentlemen&#8221; is an old-fashioned caper movie that moves exceptionally well through the stages of the crime: the initial research, the preparations, the raid for ammunition, the day of the heist, the aftermath. The film also serves as a timepiece for England in the late 1950s - the last dregs of post-war hang-ups, the loosening of morals and hints of the swinging 60s, the displacement of these men who have moved from the heroism of their war years to shady existences. Adapted from the novel by John Boland, &#8220;The League of Gentlemen&#8221; has a pacey and witty script that is buoyed by fine performances from Jack Hawkins, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey and Richard Attenborough.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962790, "name": "Basil Dearden", "creator_id": 48139, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962789, "name": "Michael Relph", "creator_id": 74958, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962788, "name": "Allied Filmmakers", "creator_id": 69759, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962787, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20055, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/6lJvpL5Z3qZxegmJHUpjGsWROtW.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "The League of gentlemen (Basil Dearden) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1400, "height": 2100, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51262", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [33137]}, {"id": 89659, "acmi_id": "312485", "title": "The Leading man", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-leading-man", "creator_credit": "John Duigan, Paul Raphael, Bertil Ohlsson and J and M Entertainment", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1996", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/7Aywawe75W7VKip12gWuiBOiDiT.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This romantic comedy, starring Jon Bon Jovi, is set in the London theatre world.

The films contains numerous excerpts of films scripted by Prevert, including &#8216;Les visiteurs du soir&#8217;, &#8216;Quai des Brumes&#8217; (both held in our collection) as well as poems interpreted by Maurice Baquet. Includes interviews of Prevert&#8217;s friends and interprets: Francis Lemarque, Jean Wiener, Raymond Bussieres, Michele Morgan, Paul Grimault, Alain Cuny, Jean-Louis Barrault, Arletty.</p>\n<p>Credits: Director, Jean Desvilles ; photography, Maurice Giraud ; music, Joseph Kosma, Francis Lemarque.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 891363, "name": "Jean Desvilles", "creator_id": 30475, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "147201", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1975", "notes": "", "to_year": "1975"}], "labels": [55958]}, {"id": 64934, "acmi_id": "000582", "title": "Jacques Lipchitz: master sculptor", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jacques-lipchitz-master-sculptor", "creator_credit": "Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and Bert Van Bork", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1968", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1968-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A colour portrait of one of the foremost pioneers in modern art.

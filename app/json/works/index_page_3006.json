What ensues is a series of intensive bar crawls where the cousins encounter a group of women from the Trade Centre, one of whom Ted promptly falls in love with. A study of the life and attitudes of two Americans abroad underlies this comic romantic tale through which the film takes on a more serious satirical tone. As the film progresses, the ineptitude of Ted and Fred to integrate with the values of the culture they inhabit is only exceeded by the anti-American sentiment in Spain which the characters do not remain untouched by, but are slow to recognise. This film will no doubt appeal to fans of Whit Stillman&#8217;s characteristic distanced play between amusement and substantial critique.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Spain", "Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Places&nbsp;→ Barcelona (Spain)", "Places&nbsp;→ Spain", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/barcelona", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2107980, "name": "Whit Stillman", "creator_id": 78672, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q972884", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2107978, "name": "New Visions Pictures", "creator_id": 18254, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121271015", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2107975, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "44392", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [27323]}, {"id": 91856, "acmi_id": "315028", "title": "Barcelona", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "barcelona", "creator_credit": "David Hall and Beckmann", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A practical guide for travellers intending to visit the Catalonian region of Spain.

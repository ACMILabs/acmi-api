Set in the later part of 1993, &#8220;Black Hawk down&#8221; follows a group of US army rangers whose mission is to capture two top lieutenants of Somalian warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. However, the mission proves fatal when the elite team are dropped down by helicopter into Mogadishu and find themselves at the mercy of Somalian gunmen. Director Ridley Scott and cinematographer Slawomir Idziak have created a vision of war that is pure chaos. Before we even have a chance to learn the names of the unfortunate U.S. soldiers, we are quickly dropped into the middle of battle with them, experiencing their confusion, their terror, as the situation gets wildly out of hand. Ultimately little else is explored in this vision of visceral horror, the Somalians becoming mere specters faintly glimpsed through opaque dust clouds, while the politics of war are left quietly alone. What emerges is the quintessential war film, acts of heroism in the face of adversity and the nobility of male to male comradeship in the line of duty.

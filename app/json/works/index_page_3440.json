The graphics and set pieces of the film rival those of &#8220;Crouching tiger, hidden dragon&#8221;, being quite spectacular in nature, with an outstanding colour palette, depicted thematically. Highlights are the female warriors fighting in an autumnal forest, a lakeside showdown and the mountain top finale for the lovers.

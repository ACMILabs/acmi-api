Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program.

There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically. This episode provides a historical background of gambling in America and the UK, focusing on the 1960s, the mafia involvement both in Las Vegas and London, and the change in attitude by society towards the &#8220;gambler&#8221;, particularly the &#8220;high rollers&#8221;.

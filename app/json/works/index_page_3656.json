All the ingredients are still there - the characters, the sex, the lies, the humor, the love and of course, always the drama. And the whole feel of the 1970s, love or hate the times, is so much brought back to life in the recreation of the settings, fashion and culture. An excellent series. Cast also includes Jackie Burroughs, Whip Hubley, Francoise Robertson, Domini Blythe, Swoosie Kurtz, and special appearances by Ed Asner and Sheila McCarthy.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>More tales of the city.

Beauchamp Day&#8217;s (Thomas Gibson) relationship with his pregnant wife Dede (Barbara Garrick) takes a rather nasty turn with Beauchamp plotting and scheming revenge on Dede. And Dede&#8217;s mother, Frannie Halcyon (Diana LeBlanc) joins the PINUS Society - a special resort for wealthy women to celebrate their 60th birthday with the help of some rather young and gorgeous houseboys. All the ingredients are still there - the characters, the sex, the lies, the humor, the love and of course, always the drama. And the whole feel of the 1970s, love or hate the times, is so much brought back to life in the recreation of the settings, fashion and culture. An excellent series. Cast also includes Jackie Burroughs, Whip Hubley, Francoise Robertson, Domini Blythe, Swoosie Kurtz, and special appearances by Ed Asner and Sheila McCarthy.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Final three episodes of this wonderful television miniseries based on the novel by Armistead Maupin.

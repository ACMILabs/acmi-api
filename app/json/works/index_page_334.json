In Europe, the US or Australia, a whole genre of films have sought to capture this right of passage in a young person&#8217;s life, where they explore their changing bodies, their own sense of identity and the world of ideas and morality. But these experiences don&#8217;t even count for small change in China.</p>\n<p>A boarding school filled with young adults might invite these connotations in Western countries, however we are shown this period is influential for completely different reasons in the PRC. The beginning of junior high means the pressure is really on: From this moment on, the young teens face extreme competition with one another in order to excel in their studies and make the grade for the best possible high-school, which is the only way of standing a chance at university admission.</p>\n<p>It is therefore a period of both extreme tension and vigorous excitement. No longer treated as children, these young adults feel that they have been invested with the responsibility for their own fate. However, the film also highlights the commonplace attitude — especially among children from rural areas — where they vow to commit suicide if they do not achieve the necessary grade for the best high school.</p>\n<p>With this said, we might expect the schools to be churning out utter monsters. Quite the opposite, in fact. Indeed, the extreme pressure and excitement of this time inspires a deep sense of cameraderie between them, as they recognise that they are not alone in their struggle.

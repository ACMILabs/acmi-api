Stanley&#8217;s film is a love story about a boxer, a gangster, and a girl, and in a case of life imitating art, the leading actor (Blaine Novak) falls in love with Carol/Betty, unbeknownst that she already has a boyfriend who also happens to he a vicious gangster and the financer of the film. This film about a film is supposedly a fictionalised account on what went on behind the production of Kubrick&#8217;s &#8220;Killer&#8217;s kiss&#8221;, and has earned comparisons to a later production - Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Bullets over Broadway&#8221; (1994).

Born in London on 16 April 1889, to parents of music hall fame who were later to divorce, Charlie lived a fairly harsh existence with his mother and older brother Sidney. However Charlie, attracted to the world of stage, finds himself by his early teens winning parts in the stage plays &#8220;Jim, a romance of cockney&#8221; and &#8220;Sherlock Holmes&#8221;. It is not long before Chaplin ends up in the United States joining Mack Sennet&#8217;s Keystone Films, and the rest, as they say, is history.

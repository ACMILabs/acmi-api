Contemplative after his near fatal car accident, Hughes reflects fondly on his childhood in Australia with an appreciation that only came from questioning his mortality. Episode two explores Australia&#8217;s national pride and nostalgia with the outback - despite the fact that only 1% of the population actually live there. Hughes traces the myths borne out of the bush that have dominated our history and folklore - especially in art - covering icons such as the shearer, the swagman, the explorer and the lost child. He also visits a sheep-shearing station, an Aboriginal community in the Kimberleys, Port Arthur historical site, an opal mine in Coober Pedy, forest in Tasmania and Ayers Rock. Native title and the myth of an infinitely rich and exploitable landscape are also discussed.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Sheep-shearing - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia - Rural conditions", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australia, Central", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Deserts - Australia", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Australia - Rural conditions", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Conservation of natural resources - Australia", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Deserts - Australia", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ National characteristics, Australian", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Nationalism", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Social isolation", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Social isolation", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ National characteristics", "Places&nbsp;→ Australia, Central", "Places&nbsp;→ Outback Australia", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - Great Britain", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series", "Television&nbsp;→ Television series&nbsp;→ Television series - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1528174, "name": "Christopher Spencer", "creator_id": 78512, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1528173, "name": "ABC-TV (Australia)", "creator_id": 11940, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1528172, "name": "BBC", "creator_id": 72467, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1528171, "name": "Oxford Film and Television", "creator_id": 34690, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1528170, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

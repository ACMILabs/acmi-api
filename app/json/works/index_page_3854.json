She played the role of Gaby in her US debut film &#8220;Algiers&#8221; (1938), followed by &#8220;Lady of the tropics&#8221; (1939), &#8220;White cargo&#8221; (1942) and &#8220;Samson and Delilah&#8221; (1949). Ava Gardner&#8217;s career began slowly with many bit parts, but her more memorable roles included the films &#8220;Show boat&#8221; (1951), The Snows of Kilimanjaro&#8221; (1952), &#8220;Mogambo&#8221; (1953) and &#8220;On the beach (1959). Her sultry beauty combined with an elusive and sometimes cool manner captured many of her leading men and her marriages first to Mickey Rooney, then Artie Shaw and finally Frank Sinatra all made front page headlines. Rita Hayworth trained as a dancer from early childhood and made her first film debut at age 16 in &#8220;Dante&#8217;s inferno&#8221; (1935) in a minor role. Her first major success was in &#8220;The Strawberry blonde&#8221; (1941) followed by a dancing role with Fred Astaire in &#8220;You&#8217;ll never get rich&#8221; (1941). However it was the film &#8220;Gilda&#8221; (1946) that evoked a sensual and stunningly dynamic image, launching Rita Hayworth into superstardom. Brigitte Bardot, French, blonde and sexy, made her screen debut as Javotte Lemoine in &#8220;Le Trou normand&#8221; (1952), married Roger Vadim and starred in her first US production &#8220;Un acte d&#8217;amour&#8221; (1954) with Kirk Douglas. Brigitte however continued to star in French productions which were dubbed for her American fans, including the Roger Vadim directed &#8220;Et dieu crea la femme = And God created woman&#8221; (1957).

But what is more interesting is the focus on Hollywood and the films which have been produced, based either on pure fantasy or &#8220;real-life&#8221; experiences. Hosted by John Carradine, Hollywood ghost stories presents film excerpts, interviews and eye witness accounts from Hollywood producers, actors, set hands to authors, psychologists, and sceptics. William Peter Blatty, author of &#8220;The Exorcist&#8221; (1973) discusses strange occurrences which took place during production; Elke Sommer talks about her experiences living in a haunted house; Thelma Moss, Psychologist, compares the film &#8220;Poltergeist&#8221; (1982) with real-life poltergeists; Frank DeFellita, author and producer of &#8220;The Entity&#8221; (1981) comments on haunted houses and how &#8220;The Entity&#8221; was based on a true experience. Also features appearances by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Susan Strasberg and includes excerpts from many of the earlier Hollywood films such as &#8220;Mystic circle murder&#8221; (1939), &#8220;I Married a witch&#8221; (1942) and &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful life&#8221; (1946).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:12:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Parapsychology - Research", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Psychic research", "Horror", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Ghosts", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Supernatural"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 882555, "name": "James M.

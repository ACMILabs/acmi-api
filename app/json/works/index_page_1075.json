He was renowned for his eccentric live performances - emerging out of coffins on stage, and laying bones, skulls and other paraphernalia atop his piano. Along with Bo Didley, Hawkins celebrated his blackness in a way that was very rare in the 1950s and frequently alluded to jungles, cannibalism and mysticism to a degree that even alienated his black audience. Hawkins fame was much diminished when his song &#8220;I put a spell on you&#8221; was used in the Jim Jarmusch cult film &#8220;Stranger than paradise&#8221; but Hawkins had lost the rights to the song, receiving few royalties from its massive success. Jarmusch also cast Hawkins as a desk clerk in &#8220;Mystery train&#8221; (1989). This documentary features interviews with Bo Didley, Diamanda Galas, Jim Jarmusch, Andrew Williams and Eric Burden as well as producers, family and friends. Songs include: I put a spell on you (several versions), Alligator wine, Frenzy, Shout and Goodnight sweetheart.

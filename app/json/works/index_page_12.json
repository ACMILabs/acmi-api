In their approach to the large and diverse volume of donated material, artists Naomi Bishops and Richard Raber worked like visual detectives, combing through hours of footage looking for tiny clues: silent exchanges, glances, anything which might at first seem unremarkable, but upon closer inspection would reveal the secret histories of an individual, situation, time or place. Once compiled, this rich archive of amateur observations was then carefully re-edited to provide poignant insights into the original footage, its inhabitants, and lost or forgotten eras.</p>\n<p>Silent and without an explicit narrative, Traces immerses its viewers in a wash of colour, form and feeling. Bishops and Raber have choreographed distinct and evocative vignettes using movement, light and pace. The vignettes appear and dissolve like nameless portraits from an unknown past, or the tail end of an echo.

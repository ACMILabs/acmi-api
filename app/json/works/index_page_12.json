Long before horses and carts found their way across the country, the land was crisscrossed by Indigenous pathways that remain the foundation for countless highways and roadways today.</p>\n<p>Knowledge of these routes, their features and cultural significance is depicted in songs, which are memorised and passed down through generations. These traditional forms of navigation and spiritual understanding of place are known as Songlines. Many of the roads you drive on today are the result of this practice. One of the most identifiable pathways in Victoria navigated for centuries is the Omeo highway connecting north-east Victoria to Gippsland through Ngarigo, Jaitmatang and Gunnai Kurnai Country.</p>\n<p>This visual poem ruminates on the layering of bitumen over these ancient routes through the lens of Australian cinema.

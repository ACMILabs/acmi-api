All these scenes are shot from an aerial perspective. 00:15:58:00 another ‘iris out’ effect closes the sequence.</p>\n<p>00:16:35:0 back in daytime, a sign above a shop is advertising &#8216;Sennitt’s Ice Cream&#8217; (this brand, started in 1904 and discontinued in 1961 may have produced Australia’s first commercial ice-cream). Crowds again line the street as the Queen’s car moves along it. 00:16:56:00 we see another good clear view of the Queen in the back of her open car.</p>\n<p>00:17:39:00 a further daytime aerial sequence of the Queen’s motorcade and mounted police (the camerawork here is quite ‘jerky’ and rather blurred). 00:18:34:00 Government House is seen in the middle distance. 00:18:40:00 the front façade of the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, is photographed in bright sunshine, with the Josef Hochgurtel fountain in front of it. Footage of the gardens surrounding the Exhibition Building follows.</p>\n<p>00:19:13:00 Green trams are photographed moving along Swanston Street in Melbourne’s CBD, before further footage of the city’s decorations. 00:19:39:00 the reel ends with a final (rather jerkily-shot) scene of the Queen’s car – preceded by policemen on motorcycles – moving along a city street as a group of onlookers wave.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:19:56:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Description and travel", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Urban transportation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "History&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - Buildings, structures, etc", "History&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.) - History", "History&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "History&nbsp;→ Visits of state", "People&nbsp;→ Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1926-", "People&nbsp;→ Philip, Prince, consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Great Britain, 1921-", "Places&nbsp;→ Flinders Street Railway Station (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne, Vic.", "Places&nbsp;→ Shrine of Remembrance (Melbourne, Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1343829, "name": "Kenneth Rankine", "creator_id": 82089, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 1095, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/hVVlgSxs-gc"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "16mm film; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file H264; ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - presentation", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": {"id": 114415, "acmi_id": "B2003219", "title": "[KenRa Films Present: the Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kenra-films-present-the-kenneth-rankine-home-movie-collection", "creator_credit": "Kenneth Rankine", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "record_type": "group", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null}, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [{"id": 114416, "acmi_id": "B2003572", "title": "[KenRa Films Present Kenneth Rankine Home Movie Collection: Reel 12.

This collection of his home movies has been donated to ACMI by Kenneth&#8217;s granddaughter. The collection represents a wonderful slice of life in Australia; with contents including scenes of everyday life, major family occasions, holidays around Victoria and views of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>This film titled &#8216;Fragments of 1940&#8217;, contains several segments each with its own title and other smaller scenes. Kenneth&#8217;s  views around the city and the Botanical Gardens as well as his own garden which often features in his films. We see good examples of signs of the era for shops and businesses such as a large wall sign for &#8216;Sidney Cooke&#8217; printers: a business which later became CMI Fasteners Manufacturers of NZ. The &#8216;Our Garden&#8217; segment shows the Rankine home garden where Kenneth captures the family circle enjoying themselves among the flowers, trees and gardening activities. There is a look at an Anzac Day parade and friends appear in military uniform - a reminder of the current war. There is also a segment showing daughter Bettye&#8217;s school sports day (uniforms indicate possible colleges, Genazzano and Vaucluse).</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:11:00 title card &#8216;Fragments of 1940&#8217; followed by sub-title, &#8216;Melbourne&#8217; begins the footage with panoramic views around Melbourne, possibly taken from somewhere in Elizabeth St as smoke from industry can be seen on the horizon presumably to the west and buildings in Elizabeth feature later in the reel.</p>\n<p>00:01:30:00 there is a view likely to be from Royal Parade looking down Elizabeth St including the Queen Victoria Market to the right of the screen at 00:00:00:00.

Kenneth also uses his artistic sub-titles to separate sequences in the reel as well as his lingering shots of flowers (a device which he used regularly throughout his films). Highlights of the reel include the 1940s style of wedding and the wedding fashions of the era. Scenes at the wedding reception show some of the customs of day such as drinking an obligatory glass of sherry (usually upon arrival) and hosting the reception in the family home.

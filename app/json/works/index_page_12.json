No more cops killing our mob!”, vocalising demands of environmental, political and social concern, and reflecting the broad diversity within contemporary Indigenous urban society.</p>\n<p>Rennie was taught martial arts by his father while growing up in Melbourne’s inner West. <i>What Do We Want?</i> marries his 25-year history of martial arts and his arts practice, while expanding Rennie’s evolving moving image repertoire into the realm of performance.</p>\n<p><i>What Do We Want?</i> takes influence from martial arts films including Blaxploitation films of the 1970s and 80s; utilising the medium to make a statement about authenticity, respect, bravery and collective power. The students in <i>What Do We Want?</i> become a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>The work loudly and proudly conveys the diversity of First Nations peoples, and the ongoing fight for justice that unifies them, raising urgent questions that require action and response.</p>\n<p>Acknowledgements</p>\n<p>Director: Reko Rennie</p>\n<p>Produced by Film Camp, Philippa Campey, Molly O&#8217;Connor</p>\n<p>Original composition by A.B.

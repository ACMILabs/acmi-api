In the centre of each screen a performer enacts a basic spinning action over and over, each dancer representing a different language or subculture of movement.</p>\n<p>Gladwell further pushes this internal paradox with a shift in perspective from the original work, changing the camera viewpoint from a front-on to an aerial view. The black and white negative images are projected on to screens suspended in the ceiling of the gallery, appearing as spinning astral bodies – a sparkling universe of whirling figures. There is a clear connection here to the <i>Planet &amp; Stars Sequence</i> and to <i>Parallel Forces</i>. Are these bodies orbiting each other? Are they aware of their relationship to a wider planetary system? Are they stationary or are they turning on a still point?</p>\n<p>The performers are training rather than performing; their focus is on repetition and rotation of movements. There is Emma Magenta, a capoeira dancer, whose roughly circular movements recall her performance in <i>Woolloomooloo Night</i> (2004). Her movements are more muscular and less centred than the tight, graceful, fluid pirouettes of Vivienne Wong, ballerina with the Australian Ballet. Anthony Lawang, a break dancer from Melbourne, performs a series of floor-based manoeuvres, transitioning from a top rock position to a backspin and a windmill, climaxing in a tight backspin, disrupting any sense of how his body is oriented spatially. Simon O’Brien, a world champion freestyle BMX rider, performs a series of highly technical spins in which the bike frame and his body are linked and twisted by concentric forces. In contrast to these athletic routines, Kathryn Puie spins her body on stilts. In the overhead shot foreshortening her body, we see her body constantly shifting and shuffling in order to remain upright. Gladwell himself performs on a skateboard, spinning continuously.

With four pairs of opposing screens set on the walls of the gallery like a hall of mirrors, it brings together the key elements of the classic ozploitation film – choppers, fast cars, motorcycles, daring physical feats and dramatic locations – and strips them of any cinematic logic or narrative to create a succession of experiments that play with point of view, audience perspective and the limits of speed.</p>\n<p>On each set of screens a body/machine performs a series of tightly sequenced manoeuvres in parallel while simultaneously fixing its gaze on its opposite across the gallery corridor. In <i>Parallel 2 x EC 120s (French Island)</i>, a cameraman, rigged to a harness attached to the interior of one of two identical Eurocopters, trains his camera on the other helicopter as they both hover above the wetlands and swoop through the rugged terrain of French Island, on Victoria’s south-east coast. The camera captures the impact of the choppers’ movement on the landscape – the brushed grass, the swaying branches.

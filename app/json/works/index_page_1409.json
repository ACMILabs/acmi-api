Moritz commented that &#8220;I Know&#8221; was positioned perfectly with the success of &#8220;Scream&#8221;, &#8220;Party of five&#8221; and &#8220;Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&#8221; Its sequel, &#8220;I still know what you did last summer,&#8221; without such support in its marketing campaign, was left to prove itself in a sea of teen horror films, all trailing in the wake of &#8220;Scream.&#8221; &#8220;I Still know&#8221; reunites us with our heroine, Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt), at university, far away from Southport where the horrors of last summer (and the summer before that), took place. The nightmares of the meat-hook-wielding fisherman are preventing Julie from putting the brutal murder of her best friend, Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), behind her. Luckily, Julie has made a new best friend, Karla (Brandy), who has won a trip to the Bahamas and convinces Julie to go with her and some other friends. They arrive only to discover that it&#8217;s the off-peak season and, with the exception of &#8216;marginally trained off-season staff&#8217;, they are alone on the island. Julie&#8217;s nightmares become a reality upon discovering the fisherman is on the island seeking his revenge. Julie is forced to fess up to her friends about her tormented past as they struggle for their lives knowing they are caught in total isolation. Refreshingly, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; has subscribed to the new paradigm of teen horror, whereby the protagonist teen character is given personality and a surname. With a supporting cast that is less disposable than the teenager characters of slasher films of the past, &#8220;I Still know&#8221; is more suspenseful and more frightening, and a horror film that can stand on its own merit. Cast includes: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Brandy, Freddy Prinze Jr., Mekhi Phifer, Muse Watson.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>I Still know what you did last summer</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Danny Cannon, Neal H.

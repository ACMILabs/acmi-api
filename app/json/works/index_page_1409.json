Despite considering that settling down is detrimental to his artistic drive, Ray forms a deep emotional attachment to a mute girl named Hattie (Samantha Morton) who is enchanted by his music. &#8220;Sweet and lowdown&#8221; retains a light comical edge throughout and should prove delightful to fans of jazz guitar. As a part of its mockumentary style, several contemporary interviews with jazz experts, including Woody Allen, give insight into Ray&#8217;s talent, collectively pondering his mysterious demise. Also stars: Anthony LaPaglia, Uma Thurman and Gretchen Mol.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Mockumentary", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Guitarists", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962152, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962151, "name": "Jean Doumanian", "creator_id": 29398, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962150, "name": "Sony Pictures Classics", "creator_id": 28274, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962149, "name": "Sweetland Films BV", "creator_id": 27595, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50912", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32864]}, {"id": 89088, "acmi_id": "311735", "title": "Swedish peasant paintings", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "swedish-peasant-paintings", "creator_credit": "Olle Hellbom and Svensk Filmindustri", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Sweden, 1958", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A study of the &#8220;gourd&#8221; paintings done by the itinerant peasant artists who flourished in the Dalecarlia district of Sweden in the eighteenth century.

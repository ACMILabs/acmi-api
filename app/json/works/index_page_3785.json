Xueli is moved by this to find inspiration for a graduation piece even better than her first, which she names &#8220;Spring Water Ding-Dong&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nThe film is a commentary on the social changes taking place within China at the time, as well as emphasising the importance of the happiness and education of a community&#8217;s children. After moving into one of the government&#8217;s newly constructed residential buildings, people from many different walks of life are faced with the joys and trials of forging a new community. China today is filled with such communities, which sprang up as a result of these government-constructed residential buildings, and the film provides a valuable glimpse into how life was at the beginning of this significant development, and how the struggles of living in such communities shaped the lives of those children, who are now the parents of today.<br />\n(2 stars - James Donald; December 15, 2010)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:36:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ China - Social life and customs", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Melodrama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ China - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communism - China", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Communities", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community development", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grandparents", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Women - China", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Community - Moral and ethical aspects", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ China"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 890194, "name": "Xiaohua Shi", "creator_id": 82684, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890193, "name": "Chen Rongxuan", "creator_id": 82863, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890192, "name": "Shanghai Film Studios", "creator_id": 21146, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 890202, "name": "Liu Yanxi", "creator_id": 82250, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890201, "name": "Fang Chao", "creator_id": 82869, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890200, "name": "Zhang Ruifang", "creator_id": 82868, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890199, "name": "Zhang Xiangfei", "creator_id": 82867, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890198, "name": "Niu Ben", "creator_id": 82866, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890197, "name": "Wei Cunbao", "creator_id": 82865, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890196, "name": "Yu Shishan", "creator_id": 82521, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 890195, "name": "Wu Jianxin", "creator_id": 82864, "role": "script", "role_id": 962, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146484", "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1982", "notes": "Released", "to_year": "1982"}], "labels": [55329]}, {"id": 91798, "acmi_id": "314960", "title": "Bubbling over", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bubbling-over", "creator_credit": "Official Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1934", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1934-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Short comedy film with singer Ethel Waters playing the part of a wife whose husband&#8217;s lazy live-in relatives make life difficult.

One of the girls, Ling Zhi, has a terrible flu, but pushes on with the preparations. In another room, Madame Jin sings about the loss of her child, 12 years ago. She laments her husband&#8217;s subsequent death, seemingly in the difficult struggle to find their son and restore the male heir. Her brother, Uncle Jin, arrives with his son Jin Hu, offering him up for adoption so that Madame Jin can finally have the son she always desired. When she expresses a longing for her biological son, Uncle Jin storms off in anger. The mysterious woman from the river – Madame Jin&#8217;s servant – enters, claiming to have found her long lost son. Ecstatically happy, Madame enlists her to collect her son and thank his foster mother for her help.</p>\n<p>Er Long tells Da Long that he is afraid that the rumour is true, and that he will be taken away from the family.

Tong Hua refuses to believe her, and is unwilling to let go of the son that she has raised as her own for all these years.<br />\nThe servant makes a plan with some local children to take the child against his will when he returns, and after a struggle with the brothers, they succeed.

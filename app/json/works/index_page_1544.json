The film&#8217;s sentimental finale drew the most fire, particularly from a very politicized Queer movement, who saw it as innocuous and conservative (three years later Jonathan Demme&#8217;s &#8216;Philadelphia&#8217; would also draw the same criticism). In retrospect however the film&#8217;s tenderness for it&#8217;s characters and it&#8217;s earnest attempt to chronicle the devastating effect of the epidemic ultimately accumulates an emotional resonance that moves, even in it&#8217;s final wish-fulfillment coda.

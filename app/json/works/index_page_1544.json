The eight men (who don&#8217;t know each other) treat the assignment like a reconnaissance mission, carefully planned under the leadership of Colonel Hyde. &#8220;The League of gentlemen&#8221; is an old-fashioned caper movie that moves exceptionally well through the stages of the crime: the initial research, the preparations, the raid for ammunition, the day of the heist, the aftermath. The film also serves as a timepiece for England in the late 1950s - the last dregs of post-war hang-ups, the loosening of morals and hints of the swinging 60s, the displacement of these men who have moved from the heroism of their war years to shady existences. Adapted from the novel by John Boland, &#8220;The League of Gentlemen&#8221; has a pacey and witty script that is buoyed by fine performances from Jack Hawkins, Nigel Patrick, Roger Livesey and Richard Attenborough.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Caper drama", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Robbery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Film adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-league-of-gentlemen", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998145, "name": "Basil Dearden", "creator_id": 48139, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q810020", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998144, "name": "Michael Relph", "creator_id": 74958, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998143, "name": "Allied Filmmakers", "creator_id": 69759, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1998142, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51262", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [33137], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93619, "acmi_id": "317131", "title": "Hearts in Atlantis", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "hearts-in-atlantis-dvd", "creator_credit": "Scott Hicks, Kerry Heysen, Village Roadshow Pictures, NPV Entertainment and Castle Rock Entertainment", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2001", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>A nostalgic film set in small town America of the 1960s about maturation and the loss of innocence.

ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton), and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen), bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he&#8217;s attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she&#8217;s going to double-cross the cops.

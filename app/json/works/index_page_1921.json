The &#8216;Philharmonic Orchestra of Israel&#8217; is conducted by Zubin Mehta, with the &#8216;New Philharmonia&#8217; choir of London. The stage direction is by Alfred Lipmann. The performance is introduced by an extract from &#8216;Napoleon et la Revolution&#8217; directed by Abel Gance. &#8216;Fidelio&#8217; was composed in reaction to the shattered hopes of the French Revolution and Napoleon&#8217;s encroaching grip over Europe. It is a classic love story in which liberty and justice triumph of oppression and tyranny thanks to the steely resolve of love.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producers, Daniele Gegauff, Stephane Tchalgadjieff ; director, Pierre Jourdain ; photography, Michel Kelber.<br />\nCast: Gundula Janovitz, Jon Vickers, Theo Adam.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["French", "German"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2238946, "name": "Pierre Jourdan", "creator_id": 37601, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3385636", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2238942, "name": "Daniele Gegauff", "creator_id": 83198, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2238944, "name": "Stephane Tchalgadjieff", "creator_id": 30784, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3502097", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146900", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1979", "notes": "", "to_year": "1979"}], "labels": [55664]}, {"id": 94966, "acmi_id": "319002", "title": "Fearless: stories from Asian women", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fearless-stories-from-asian-women", "creator_credit": "Matthew Kelley, Peter Du Cane, Samantha Kelley and Film Australia", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2002", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2002-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This documentary examines the experiences of four women fighting for social justice.

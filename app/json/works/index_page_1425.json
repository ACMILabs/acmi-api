We see the family drive across the bridge to Phillip Island and enjoy swimming and canoeing at the beach there. The reel also includes scenes of caravan camping, koalas and a trip to the war memorial at Mount Macedon. The family enjoy games of tennis, ball games and swings and roundabouts at a playground.

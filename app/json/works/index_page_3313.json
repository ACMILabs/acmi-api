Reflective about the past, Soha&#8217;s thoughts however are with the future and maintaining a strong commitment to carrying on the &#8220;political, economical, social and cultural struggle&#8221; for the ones who still remain in the detention centre and for the liberation of Lebanon from Israeli occupation. The interview solely takes place in Soha&#8217;s Paris room one year after her release. A poignant and sensitive film enhanced by the intimacy and interaction between filmmaker and subject.

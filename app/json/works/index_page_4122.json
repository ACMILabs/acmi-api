The Aztecs were a highly evolved society, literate, cultural and amazingly adaptable to what was a fairly inhospitable environment. They were able to transform the landscape to suit their needs and to build their temples and houses. But they were also a civilization consumed with mythological beliefs inextricably linked to nature and the seasons and these beliefs required offerings and sacrifices to the Gods, human sacrifices, to ensure the continuation of life. However their fate was not sealed by the Gods, but by the conquering Spanish Conquistadors 200 years later.

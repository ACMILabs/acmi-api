Through interviews with the populace of the time, which provides an insightful representation of the mood of the early communist era, rare footage of Mao and Chinese life at the time, interviews with political analysts and academics and Western contemporaries, this first part of the program offers a comprehensive study of Mao&#8217;s leadership.

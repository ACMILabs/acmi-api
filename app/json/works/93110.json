The setting is Stockholm, 1975, in the maelstrom of the counter culture movement. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren), a suburban housewife and mother of two, is leaving her abusive and alcoholic husband, Rolf (Michael Nygvist). Her choice of refuge is her brother&#8217;s commune where he is living with numerous adults, several couples and their children. The house is a hotbed of political thought, feminist ideals, sexual freedom and alternative thinking. Moodysson economically and amusingly depicts the tensions within the extended group and the complex, shifting relationships in the commune. The children in &#8220;Together&#8221; are realistically depicted, in particular Elisabeth&#8217;s children, Eva (Emma Samuelsson), a depressed and lonely teen, and Stefan (Sam Kessel), who longs for his father and a return to the nuclear family. Elisabeth&#8217;s brother Goran (Gustav Hammarsten) is the lynchpin of the house, a peacekeeper who aims to keep all members of the commune from warring with each other, despite his own woes with his partner, Lena. &#8220;Together&#8221; is a moving and funny tale of individuals, groups, couples, children, outsiders, swingers, ideologues, families, neighbours and friends.

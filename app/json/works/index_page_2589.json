His other films &#8216;Bob le flambeur&#8217;</em> and &#8216;Les enfants terribles&#8217; are also highly regarded by the young turks of les Cahiers for whom Melville becomes a father figure. While &#8216;Les cousins&#8217;<em> and &#8216;A bout de souffle&#8217;</em> owed a particular debt to the Hollywood thriller, &#8216;La Nouvelle Vague&#8217; as a whole brought a fresh sensibility and a radical style of filming to French cinema, indeed arguably to world cinema. Godard&#8217;s &#8216;A bout de souffle&#8217; startled audiences with the systematic use of jump cuts, and Truffaut&#8217;s &#8216;Les 400 coups&#8217;<em> ended in stunning fashion with a freeze-frame. In contrast with &#8216;la tradition de qualite&#8217;, the aesthetics of New Wave cinema was improvisational (unscripted), and its photography and editing were far less mannered than its predecessors&#8217;. Working with low budgets, using the new cheaper and lighter equipment, able to to film in real locations and at night if required, influenced by television practices like hand-held shooting and the interview straight to the camera, the &#8216;Nouvelle Vague&#8217; film-makers paradoxically achieved a vibrant and graphic realism while at the same time experimenting self-consciously with the medium of film.&#8221; References: Guy Austin. &#8216;Contemporary French cinema: an introduction&#8217;.

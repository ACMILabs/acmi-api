Director Ryszard Bugajski escaped to Canada with a smuggled copy of the film enabling him to show it at various film festivals until 1990 when the Cannes Film Festival awarded its Best Actress Award to Krystyna Janda for her riveting performance in the leading role of Tonia Dziwisz. Tonia is married, a cabaret singer out to enjoy life, rather naive and A-political. After a drunken one night stand with a military officer Tonia awakens the morning after to find herself in a prison cell with several other women prisoners, and with no knowledge as to how and why she is there. The story takes a chilling turn and we are witness to some of the most horrifying abuse and torture, relentless in its intensity and disturbing in its graphically realistic images. The vicious interrogations which Tonia is continually subjected to only increase her inner strength to survive, to maintain her dignity and her sanity and to never give up.

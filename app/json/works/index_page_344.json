Shot in black and white Super-8 film, Benning&#8217;s lyrical short muses on a disengaged youth and grey afternoons spent wandering, and features the hard-edged music of Come, an alternative band from Boston. <i>The Judy Spots</i> is a tape composed of five episodes featuring Judy, a teenage girl puppet made of papiermache as she plays in a band, works at a fast food restaurant, shops at the mall and feels scared at night. <i>Flat is Beautiful</i> is an experimental, live-action cartoon narrative using masks, animation, subtitles, drawings and dramatic scenes to investigate the psychic life of an androgynous eleven-year-old girl. Growing up in a working class neighborhood with her single mother and gay roommate, Taylor confronts the loneliness of living between masculine and feminine in a culture obsessed with defining gender difference.

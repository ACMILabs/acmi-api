Like Friedrich’s subject, the trials rider is ‘wedged between two time signatures – the slow geological signature of the rocks and the furious swell of the ocean’, as Gladwell describes it. As the rider reaches the top of the rocks he rests, putting his feet to the ground, and takes in the view of the ocean from a vantage point he has worked hard to achieve. Like Friedrich’s wanderer, Gladwell’s rider is insignificant within a landscape while striving for mastery over it.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Durations", "display_values": ["00:11:48:00", "00:12:33:00"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Measurements", "display_values": ["1816235 kbytes (1774mbytes)", "1903367 kbytes (1859mbytes)"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["2 channel video, projection, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1230344, "name": "Shaun Gladwell", "creator_id": 9260, "role": "artist", "role_id": 505, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1230345, "name": "Simon Betteridge", "creator_id": 81803, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230346, "name": "Damien Gillings", "creator_id": 81804, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230347, "name": "Rian Arnold", "creator_id": 81805, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230348, "name": "Jason Consunji", "creator_id": 81806, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230349, "name": "Tim Gargano", "creator_id": 81807, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230350, "name": "Sophie Holvast", "creator_id": 81808, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230351, "name": "Charles Ko Hsu", "creator_id": 81809, "role": "performer", "role_id": 576, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230352, "name": "Gotaro Uematsu", "creator_id": 73575, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1230353, "name": "Josh Raymond", "creator_id": 73576, "role": "photographer", "role_id": 440, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "158435", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2011", "notes": "", "to_year": "2011"}], "labels": [46818]}, {"id": 107326, "acmi_id": "Z000086", "title": "Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sagittarius-domain-prelude", "creator_credit": "Shaun Gladwell", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2011", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "2 channel video, projection, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2011-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>&#8220;Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude&#8221; is a dual-channel video installation commissioned for the exhibition &#8220;Shaun Gladwell: Stereo Sequences&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sagittarius/Domain + Prelude&#8221; sits in an enclosed room, two screens facing each other on opposite walls.

Both men died before their time in the wilderness doing what they loved, and left a legacy of stunning landscape and nature photography which became synonymous with campaigns to protect Tasmania&#8217;s natural heritage. They believed that if people could see the beauty of Australia&#8217;s wild places then they might be moved to save them. Through the sixties and seventies Truchanas raised public awareness about the beauty and uniqueness of the Tasmanian wilderness, and the threat to it posed by the Tasmanian government&#8217;s massive hydro-electric schemes, through his now legendary slide presentations. After his death his work was carried on by Dombrovskis who published his images in calendars and allowed them to be used freely in the successful campaign to save the Franklin River from hydro-electric development. Combining interviews and archival footage with over 300 photographs by Truchanas and Dombrowskis, &#8216;Wildness&#8217; is an accomplished tribute to the two men&#8217;s invaluable contribution to both visual culture and environmental awareness in Australia.

They believed that if people could see the beauty of Australia&#8217;s wild places then they might be moved to save them. Through the sixties and seventies Truchanas raised public awareness about the beauty and uniqueness of the Tasmanian wilderness, and the threat to it posed by the Tasmanian government&#8217;s massive hydro-electric schemes, through his now legendary slide presentations. After his death his work was carried on by Dombrovskis who published his images in calendars and allowed them to be used freely in the successful campaign to save the Franklin River from hydro-electric development.

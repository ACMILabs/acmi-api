She has a glimmer of hope that justice will prevail after the arrival of British policeman Paul Kerrigan (Brian Cox) who has been sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, and the actions of the three men implicated in the deaths: members of the undercover anti terrorist squad, the SSU (Special Support Unit).

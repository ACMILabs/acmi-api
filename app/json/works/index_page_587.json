His public art piece &#8220;Ecce homo&#8221; - a life size figure of Christ marking the new millennium - drew great acclaim, and was a positive experience for the artist. Fixating on the opening of John&#8217;s Gospel in the Bible, and drawing inspiration from theology and the scriptures, Wallinger created &#8220;Angel&#8221; (1997), an intriguing video art piece that is a rumination on faith. &#8220;Prometheus&#8221; (1999), a thought-provoking piece, addressing the issues of mortality, morality, the after-life and purgatory, utilises an electric chair, a video component, amid other mediums. Wallinger&#8217;s art is often witty and immediately accessible yet at the same time it engages with some grand themes - religion, spirituality, life and death. In an interesting interview Wallinger discusses his identity as a British artist and his interest in horse racing, identifying it as an exaggerated microcosm of British society, as well as the meanings, motivations and ambitions that drive his creative spirit.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Mark Wallinger [Widescreen]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Illuminations Films</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>United Kingdom, 2002</p>", "description": "<p>Episode of Series &#8220;TheEYE&#8221;.<br />\nPart of a series of interview-based profiles of contemporary visual artists in Britain - this episode focuses on Mark Wallinger.

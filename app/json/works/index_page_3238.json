This film was beset with difficulties from the start. After years of attempting to obtain sufficient finance to film Kipling&#8217;s original story, Flaherty found support from Alexander Korda in 1935 and the Flahertys journeyed to India to adopt (from them) a new method of film making - the original practice adopted by Flaherty of &#8220;letting the story flow&#8221; and absorbing the way of life of native people and their surroundings was not entirely carried out in the case of &#8220;Elephant boy&#8221;. Whilst much of the film was shot in studios in England, the film is distinguished by beautiful photography and many fine sequences breathing the very atmosphere of India, captured by Flaherty on location</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:18:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Animal films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Social life and customs", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children 6-12", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 947643, "name": "London Film Productions", "creator_id": 14653, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947644, "name": "Alexander Korda", "creator_id": 14654, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947645, "name": "Robert Joseph Flaherty", "creator_id": 14655, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 947646, "name": "Zoltan Korda", "creator_id": 14656, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "22727", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1936", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1936"}], "labels": [6600]}, {"id": 67110, "acmi_id": "003226", "title": "Elephant baby", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "elephant-baby", "creator_credit": "Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and Milan Herzog", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1958", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This film tells the story of a baby elephant from its first day in the jungle, through many weeks of training, to the day it joins a working force of elephants in a lumber camp.

Lucienne Delamare, the mayor of a small town in the Loire Valley discovers that his wife is having an affair with his deputy, and decides to blackmail the latter into going along with a crooked property deal. The scheme is to redevelop a high-rise dwelling and factory for workers, but Lucienne will be the principal beneficiary. &#8216;Les Noces Rouge&#8217; is another variation on Chabrol&#8217;s pet theme of infidelity leading to murder and is as elegant and cool as one expects from a director secure in his subject. A darkly comic tale of revenge, greed and petty corruption.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Andre Genoves ; director, writer, Claude Chabrol ; photography, Jean Rabier ; music, Pierre Jansen ; editing, Jacques Gaillard, Monique Gaillard.<br />\nCast: Michel Piccoli, Stephan Audran, Clotilde Joano, Eliana De Santis, Ermanno Casanova.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 889496, "name": "Les Films de la Boetie", "creator_id": 22866, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889497, "name": "Canaria Films", "creator_id": 82221, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889498, "name": "Andre Genoves", "creator_id": 31905, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 889499, "name": "Claude Chabrol", "creator_id": 25145, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "35mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146349", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1973", "notes": "", "to_year": "1973"}], "labels": [55199], "external_references": [{"id": 884, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q886633"}]}, {"id": 116413, "acmi_id": "X000700", "title": "Les Nations S'affirment", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "les-nations-saffirment", "creator_credit": "Roland Darbois", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This episode deals with the slow movement of affirmation of regional styles as a sign of resistance against the &#8216;French gothic&#8217;.

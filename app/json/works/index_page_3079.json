Butterfly is left heart-broken but always hopeful of his return. Three long years pass by before Pinkerton, after learning that Butterfly had given birth to a son fathered by him just before his return to America, decides to make the trip back to Japan. Only this time he has a wife in tow and the sole intention of taking his child back to America leaving Butterfly entirely alone. What follows is a most tragic and heart-breaking climax. Seeing opera presented in film as opposed to on stage has quite a powerful effect. Film through its cinematography (Phillipe Welt) opens up the boundaries of scope of outside landscapes and lush settings enhancing the period of costume, culture, mood and the beautiful music of Puccini and allowing a natural flow to the story. Superb performances by the leading singers with a great support performance by Ning Liang (Suzuki), Richard Cowen (Sharpless), Jing Ma Fan, Christopheren Nomura, Constance Hauman, Yo Kusakabe, Kamel Touati, Miki-Lou Pinard. Featuring the Orchestre de Paris and the Choeurs de Radio France with musical direction by James Conlon and artistic direction by Michel Glotz and Daniel Zalay.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:49:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Motion pictures and music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Musicals", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997905, "name": "Frederic Mitterrand", "creator_id": 35318, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997903, "name": "Daniel Toscan du Plantier", "creator_id": 80325, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q325453", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997904, "name": "Pierre-Olivier Bardet", "creator_id": 29473, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q85624835", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997900, "name": "Erato FIlms", "creator_id": 25174, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299281", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997902, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997901, "name": "Ideale Audience", "creator_id": 29470, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034719", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51108", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [33040]}, {"id": 93517, "acmi_id": "316972", "title": "The Neon bible [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-neon-bible-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Terence Davies, Elizabeth Karlsen, Olivia Stewart, Academy Pictures, Channel Four Films, Iberoamerican Films, Scala, Screen Partners and Three Rivers", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1994", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1994-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47763, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3521995"}], "brief_description": "<p>Adapted from the Pulitzer prize winning book by John Kennedy Toole, &#8220;The Neon bible&#8221; is a beautifully scripted and directed film about a sixteen-year-old boy, David (Jacob Tierney) and his reminiscings of his childhood in the bible belt of rural Georgia during the 1940s.

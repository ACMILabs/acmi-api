In Chinese mythology the Eight Immortals are believed to know the secrets of nature. They represent separately male, female, the old, the young, the rich, the noble, the poor, and the humble peasant. Each Immortal’s power can be transferred to a tool of power, kind of a talisman associated with a certain meaning that can give life or destroy evil. In modern China, the Eight Immortals are still a popular theme in artwork.

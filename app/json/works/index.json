Establishing her photographic practice in the late 1960s, she was the first woman photographer to hold a solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1974. She was a key figure in Melbourne&#8217;s art scene throughout the 1970s, where she was involved with the Women&#8217;s Art Group alongside artists such as Bonita Ely and Micky Allan. After a time spent in Sydney where she was involved with the Sydney Filmmakers Cooperative, she became a founding member of the feminist film collective Reel Women in the late 1970s.</p>\n<p>Most of her films were created during this period and she continued to make photographic and multimedia work throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Her work is held in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the Art Gallery of Western Australia, and the National Gallery of Australia.</p>\n<p>The Sue Ford Moving Image Collection has been generously donated to ACMI by the Sue Ford Archive, co-directed by her son, Ben Ford, and friend, Joy Hirst.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Short films"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1881871, "name": "Sue Ford", "creator_id": 6720, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [{"id": 118037, "acmi_id": "B2003616", "title": "Egami", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "egami", "creator_credit": "Victorian Women's Film Unit and Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1985", "record_type": "work", "type": "Artwork", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 97661, "acmi_id": "506736", "title": "Faces", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "faces", "creator_credit": "Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1976", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1976-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 120103, "acmi_id": "B2004414", "title": "Jenny Watson, painter", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "jenny-watson-painter", "creator_credit": "Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1975", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 118038, "acmi_id": "B2003617", "title": "Low deposit, easy terms", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "low-deposit-easy-terms", "creator_credit": "Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1971", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00"}, {"id": 120099, "acmi_id": "B2003619", "title": "Time changes", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "time-changes", "creator_credit": "Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1978", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}, {"id": 120100, "acmi_id": "B2003618", "title": "Woman in a house", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "woman-in-a-house", "creator_credit": "Nigel Buesst and Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00"}], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "172723", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "c. 1970-2001", "notes": "", "to_year": "c. 1970-2001"}], "labels": [59563], "external_references": []}, {"id": 120100, "acmi_id": "B2003618", "title": "Woman in a house", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "woman-in-a-house", "creator_credit": "Nigel Buesst and Sue Ford", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1972", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1972-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>One of Sue Ford’s earliest films, &#8220;Woman in a house&#8221; is a feminist critique of domestic female roles.

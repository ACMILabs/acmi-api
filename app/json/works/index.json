The program explores not only the historical background of the rock paintings but theorises on the first arrival of First Nations peoples to this land and the formation of the landscape itself through archaeological, geological and palaeontological evidence.<br />\nDuring the 1950s Australian artist and author Percy Trezise went on a quest to locate the rock art around Laura in the Cape York region and through contact with First Nations elders and befriending First Nations writer, Dick Roughsey, he was eventually accepted as a &#8220;tribal brother&#8221;. In this program, Percy, using images from his own paintings, interprets First Nations Dreamtime stories, mythology and initiation ceremonies as represented by the rock paintings. He speaks of his own experiences and respect for First Nations peoples, their culture and their heritage. Voice over narration by Chris Schenkel.

Drawing on influences that range from Blade Runner (1992)’s techno-futurist cityscapes to an 18th-century Indian astronomical observatory, Kim twists sci-fi tropes into a speculative story rich with otherworldly doubles, interdimensional journeys and colliding worlds.</p>\n<p>From a high-octane motorcycle chase through ancient ruins to a cat-and-mouse game down neon streets, an ordinary delivery driver must outrun her enemies and embrace her destiny to save time-keeping traditions across possible worlds. With a dynamic mix of live-action footage, app interfaces, CGI avatars and landscapes powered by game engines, Kim uses the tools of screen culture and our hyper-networked age to question time, productivity and the self.</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim’s deep research into geopolitics, mythology and technology forms the basis of her work. She establishes idiosyncratic connections between biopolitics and border control, the memory of stone and virtual memory, ancestral origins and imminent futures. These narratives take the forms of video, VR, sonic fiction, image, diagram and text, and are presented as exhibitions, performances, theatrical projects and publications.</p>\n<p>Through the creation of engaging characters and stories, Kim explores her theoretical interest in the intersections of time, space and knowledge systems.</p>\n<p>Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver continues the story of Ayoung Kim’s award-winning Delivery Dancer’s Sphere (2022). Made during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first work follows courier Ernst Mo and her doppelganger En Storm as they navigate a techno-futuristic Seoul under the eye of a tyrannical algorithm, expressed through a delivery app. Its mission is to control time through efficiency and productivity, reflecting how society pushes us towards self-optimisation and economic output.</p>\n<p>In Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver, Ernst Mo and En Storm escape the endless maze of package pick-ups and deliveries. No longer ordinary couriers, they transport time itself across deserts, cities and different dimensions. Traversing different calendar mechanics and astronomical technologies, they’re tangled in networks of space and time that contradict and collide.</p>\n<p>Through settings and dialogue, Kim evokes pre-colonial and non-Western knowledge systems, presenting an alternative to our increasingly fractured and accelerated life. By mixing ancient wisdom and navigation techniques with advanced technology and aesthetics, another possible world – and ways of moving through it – emerges.</p>\n<p>How it was made</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim began by writing a detailed script, which ran over 60 pages. The work was shot using a combination of traditional filmmaking, CGI and videogame techniques.</p>\n<p>Much of the footage was shot with actors on location, but the opening desert world, the kaleidoscopic zero-gravity space and other worlds were made in the videogame engine Unity. Kim also imported LiDAR scans of building interiors to Unity, allowing her to control camera angles in a way that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.</p>\n<p>To create the animated avatars, Kim used motion capture footage of dancers and martial arts choreographers. The project required a skilled crew, including costume designers, 3D modellers, choreographers, CGI animators and sound designers.</p>\n<p>Ideas of time and navigation</p>\n<p>The artwork opens on the vernal equinox, a twice-annual period when the sun is exactly above the equator. It’s the only time global positioning systems (GPS), which track Ernst Mo and En Storm’s position and productivity, can be disrupted. This astrological event allows the duo to strike against the algorithm as part of a multiverse resistance.</p>\n<p>The symmetrical stone structure seen at the beginning of the artwork is the Vrihat Samrat Yantra, an enormous sundial at the Jantar Mantar observatory in Jaipur, India. It represents an older way of keeping time, offering a counterpoint to digital interfaces like the Delivery Dancer app, which cheerfully gives Ernst Mo her delivery routes and directives.</p>\n<p>When Ernst Mo and En Storm fall from the cliff, their own app and travel device, ‘Guest Stars’, activates. You can hear chant-like whispers counting time in different calendar systems, including Buddhist, Celtic, Persian, Hebrew, Hijri (Islamic), Shaka Samvat (Hindu), Jawa (Indonesian), Japanese, Lunar (Korean), Taiwanese and Gregorian calendars, as the characters are transported to other possible worlds. Guest Stars’ was inspired by an unofficial app developed by drivers on the Indonesian platform Gojek. It also references an era before GPS when people would use stars to navigate and the sky to tell time.</p>\n<p>South Korean sci-fi</p>\n<p>While South Korea has a long history of science fiction literature, comics and cinema, its popularity exploded with the arrival of PCs in the 1990s. ‘Sci-fi clubs’ sprang up on the internet through chatrooms like Hi-Tel and the impact of online authors like Djuna, with fans able to connect and share stories. Contemporary films such as Space Sweepers (2021, Sung-hee Jo), Jung_E (2023, Yeon Sang-ho) and Bong Joon-ho’s Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013) are major hits both at home and internationally.</p>\n<p>Sci-fi screen references in Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim has a longstanding fascination with sci-fi. In her extensive notes, she outlines some of the influences on this work. She describes the villain’s outfit as “somewhat like Neo in The Matrix (1999)”, pays homage to Æon Flux (2005) in a struggle between Ernst Mo and En Storm, and notes, “Creatures resembling jellyfish storm the city like the Zergs from (competitive multiplayer game) StarCraft (1998)”.</p>\n<p>The doppelganger</p>\n<p>In sci-fi, a doppelganger is a character&#8217;s double, often a clone or parallel universe counterpart, exploring themes of identity, duality, and psychological conflict. Repetition of self by means of multiverse is one of the many nods to the sci-fi genre in this work.</p>\n<p>Possible worlds theory</p>\n<p>Possible worlds theory is a philosophical concept used to explore different ways reality might have been. For example, what if dinosaurs still existed? That scenario would be a possible world. Possible worlds theory helps us consider alternate realities that could exist if different choices were made or different events occurred.</p>\n<p>Transworld entities</p>\n<p>An individual in our world could have counterparts or even the same identity in other possible worlds. These counterparts or identities can have different properties or make different choices, but they are versions of the same entity. Ernst Mo is a transworld entity.</p>\n<p>Ernst Mo and En Storm</p>\n<p>“Who was it who said entities couldn’t divide?”</p>\n<p>Ernst Mo is a driver with the delivery platform Delivery Dancer. She navigates the different points of a futuristic Seoul as she receives constant calls from the Delivery Dancer app’s AI algorithm “Dancemaster”.</p>\n<p>When Ernst Mo encounters her double from another world her life changes. In the first chapter of Kim’s speculative narrative, Delivery Dancer’s Sphere, these two beings become entangled with one another. Each time they meet time slows, disrupting Ernst Mo’s delivery duties. En Storm is both an otherworldly mirror of Ernst Mo and an antagonist in the story. When Ernst Mo defeats Enstorm in the first work, she creates a rift in time and space, finally realising that she’s not bound to one world but is a trans-world being.</p>\n<p>In Dancer&#8217;s Sphere: 0° Receiver, Ernst Mo now has the power to move between worlds or exist in them simultaneously, with En Storm leading Ernst Mo to an awakening across different worlds, where they experience cooperation, hostility, compassion and understanding toward one another.</p>\n<p>Delivery Dancer platform and Dancemaster</p>\n<p>A powerful delivery platform that Ernst Mo delivers packages for in this fictional version of Seoul. It is powered by Dancemaster, an algorithm that cheerfully directs Ernst Mo but also controls her time and productivity.</p>\n<p>Counterpart theory</p>\n<p>The counterpart theory suggests that individuals do not exist in multiple worlds but have counterparts in other possible worlds. These counterparts are similar but not identical to the individuals in the actual world. So, in the counterpart theory, there might be a &#8220;version&#8221; of you in another possible world, but it&#8217;s technically a different individual—a counterpart.</p>\n<p>Theory of worldbound Individuals</p>\n<p>The theory of worldbound individuals asserts that each individual exists in only one possible world. In other words, an individual in our world cannot be the same as an individual in another possible world, even if they are very similar.</p>\n<p>World-building</p>\n<p>Worldbuilding is the process of creating an imaginary world for books, film, videogames and other forms of media. It&#8217;s about constructing a detailed and immersive setting that feels real and believable, providing a backdrop for characters and events.</p>\n<p>Timekeepers and Shadow Definer</p>\n<p>The Delivery Dancer platform is part of the Timekeepers’ mission to enforce their idea of ‘Universal Time’ across possible worlds. Universal Time replaces the unique calendar systems of a world with the Timekeepers’ to expand their power over time and space.</p>\n<p>Their power is also enforced by the Shadow Definer. Travelling between worlds, the Shadow Definer tracks down beings who aren’t achieving their productivity goals – like Ernst Mo. Controlling productivity is another way the Timekeepers rule time.</p>\n<p>The Shadow Definer is named after a gnomon, the triangular part of a sundial, which have been used to measure time since 1200 BCE. The Shadow Definer costume is inspired by The Matrix films.</p>\n<p>Dancers’ Power</p>\n<p>Dancers’ Power is a multiverse resistance movement. In Kim’s speculative Seoul, Dancers&#8217; Power tries to improve the treatment of Delivery Dancer drivers. Its members can travel to other possible worlds where they resist the Timekeepers and work to preserve each world’s unique time and calendar. In DD0° Receiver, they communicate with Ernst Mo through an unauthorised app, “Guest Stars”, which diverts, deceives and disrupts the GPS that powers Delivery Dancer.</p>\n<p>“Guest Stars” was inspired by an unofficial app developed by drivers on the Indonesian platform Gojek. It also references an era before GPS when people would use starts to navigate and tell time.</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Delivery Dancer&#8217;s Sphere: 0° Receiver</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Korea, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic Of, 2024</p>", "description": "<p>South Korean artist Ayoung Kim blends cinematic storytelling, videogame technology and science fiction in her mind-bending new work, Deliver Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver.

Drawing on influences that range from Blade Runner (1992)’s techno-futurist cityscapes to an 18th-century Indian astronomical observatory, Kim twists sci-fi tropes into a speculative story rich with otherworldly doubles, interdimensional journeys and colliding worlds.</p>\n<p>From a high-octane motorcycle chase through ancient ruins to a cat-and-mouse game down neon streets, an ordinary delivery driver must outrun her enemies and embrace her destiny to save time-keeping traditions across possible worlds. With a dynamic mix of live-action footage, app interfaces, CGI avatars and landscapes powered by game engines, Kim uses the tools of screen culture and our hyper-networked age to question time, productivity and the self.</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim’s deep research into geopolitics, mythology and technology forms the basis of her work. She establishes idiosyncratic connections between biopolitics and border control, the memory of stone and virtual memory, ancestral origins and imminent futures. These narratives take the forms of video, VR, sonic fiction, image, diagram and text, and are presented as exhibitions, performances, theatrical projects and publications.</p>\n<p>Through the creation of engaging characters and stories, Kim explores her theoretical interest in the intersections of time, space and knowledge systems.</p>\n<p>Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver continues the story of Ayoung Kim’s award-winning Delivery Dancer’s Sphere (2022). Made during the COVID-19 pandemic, the first work follows courier Ernst Mo and her doppelganger En Storm as they navigate a techno-futuristic Seoul under the eye of a tyrannical algorithm, expressed through a delivery app. Its mission is to control time through efficiency and productivity, reflecting how society pushes us towards self-optimisation and economic output.</p>\n<p>In Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver, Ernst Mo and En Storm escape the endless maze of package pick-ups and deliveries. No longer ordinary couriers, they transport time itself across deserts, cities and different dimensions. Traversing different calendar mechanics and astronomical technologies, they’re tangled in networks of space and time that contradict and collide.</p>\n<p>Through settings and dialogue, Kim evokes pre-colonial and non-Western knowledge systems, presenting an alternative to our increasingly fractured and accelerated life. By mixing ancient wisdom and navigation techniques with advanced technology and aesthetics, another possible world – and ways of moving through it – emerges.</p>\n<p>How it was made</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim began by writing a detailed script, which ran over 60 pages. The work was shot using a combination of traditional filmmaking, CGI and videogame techniques.</p>\n<p>Much of the footage was shot with actors on location, but the opening desert world, the kaleidoscopic zero-gravity space and other worlds were made in the videogame engine Unity. Kim also imported LiDAR scans of building interiors to Unity, allowing her to control camera angles in a way that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.</p>\n<p>To create the animated avatars, Kim used motion capture footage of dancers and martial arts choreographers. The project required a skilled crew, including costume designers, 3D modellers, choreographers, CGI animators and sound designers.</p>\n<p>Ideas of time and navigation</p>\n<p>The artwork opens on the vernal equinox, a twice-annual period when the sun is exactly above the equator. It’s the only time global positioning systems (GPS), which track Ernst Mo and En Storm’s position and productivity, can be disrupted. This astrological event allows the duo to strike against the algorithm as part of a multiverse resistance.</p>\n<p>The symmetrical stone structure seen at the beginning of the artwork is the Vrihat Samrat Yantra, an enormous sundial at the Jantar Mantar observatory in Jaipur, India. It represents an older way of keeping time, offering a counterpoint to digital interfaces like the Delivery Dancer app, which cheerfully gives Ernst Mo her delivery routes and directives.</p>\n<p>When Ernst Mo and En Storm fall from the cliff, their own app and travel device, ‘Guest Stars’, activates. You can hear chant-like whispers counting time in different calendar systems, including Buddhist, Celtic, Persian, Hebrew, Hijri (Islamic), Shaka Samvat (Hindu), Jawa (Indonesian), Japanese, Lunar (Korean), Taiwanese and Gregorian calendars, as the characters are transported to other possible worlds. Guest Stars’ was inspired by an unofficial app developed by drivers on the Indonesian platform Gojek. It also references an era before GPS when people would use stars to navigate and the sky to tell time.</p>\n<p>South Korean sci-fi</p>\n<p>While South Korea has a long history of science fiction literature, comics and cinema, its popularity exploded with the arrival of PCs in the 1990s. ‘Sci-fi clubs’ sprang up on the internet through chatrooms like Hi-Tel and the impact of online authors like Djuna, with fans able to connect and share stories. Contemporary films such as Space Sweepers (2021, Sung-hee Jo), Jung_E (2023, Yeon Sang-ho) and Bong Joon-ho’s Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013) are major hits both at home and internationally.</p>\n<p>Sci-fi screen references in Delivery Dancer’s Arc: 0° Receiver</p>\n<p>Ayoung Kim has a longstanding fascination with sci-fi. In her extensive notes, she outlines some of the influences on this work. She describes the villain’s outfit as “somewhat like Neo in The Matrix (1999)”, pays homage to Æon Flux (2005) in a struggle between Ernst Mo and En Storm, and notes, “Creatures resembling jellyfish storm the city like the Zergs from (competitive multiplayer game) StarCraft (1998)”.</p>\n<p>The doppelganger</p>\n<p>In sci-fi, a doppelganger is a character&#8217;s double, often a clone or parallel universe counterpart, exploring themes of identity, duality, and psychological conflict. Repetition of self by means of multiverse is one of the many nods to the sci-fi genre in this work.</p>\n<p>Possible worlds theory</p>\n<p>Possible worlds theory is a philosophical concept used to explore different ways reality might have been. For example, what if dinosaurs still existed? That scenario would be a possible world. Possible worlds theory helps us consider alternate realities that could exist if different choices were made or different events occurred.</p>\n<p>Transworld entities</p>\n<p>An individual in our world could have counterparts or even the same identity in other possible worlds. These counterparts or identities can have different properties or make different choices, but they are versions of the same entity. Ernst Mo is a transworld entity.</p>\n<p>Ernst Mo and En Storm</p>\n<p>“Who was it who said entities couldn’t divide?”</p>\n<p>Ernst Mo is a driver with the delivery platform Delivery Dancer. She navigates the different points of a futuristic Seoul as she receives constant calls from the Delivery Dancer app’s AI algorithm “Dancemaster”.</p>\n<p>When Ernst Mo encounters her double from another world her life changes. In the first chapter of Kim’s speculative narrative, Delivery Dancer’s Sphere, these two beings become entangled with one another. Each time they meet time slows, disrupting Ernst Mo’s delivery duties. En Storm is both an otherworldly mirror of Ernst Mo and an antagonist in the story.

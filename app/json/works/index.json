McCall was one of the first visual artists to experiment with spatial film and temporal sculpture, emerging in the mid 1970s with the &#8216;Solid Light&#8217; film series - works that used a 16mm projector to project cones of light through smoke or haze filled rooms. His work attracted renewed attention in the 1990s, when spatial installations once again became a popular and critical tendency in contemporary art. He now uses digital projection and complex graphic software systems to capture the most basic sensory element of the moving image: the projection of light.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Interactive media", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Movement in art", "Digital Art", "Experimental"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}, {"label": "Object Types", "display_values": ["Installation"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["computer, computer script, projector and  haze machine"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2524457, "name": "Anthony McCall", "creator_id": 75936, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "152025", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Edition no. 1/5", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [53978]}, {"id": 120510, "acmi_id": "P190513", "title": "Space architect Galina Balashova working", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "space-architect-galina-balashova-working", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "<p>Image reproduced from Philip Meuser&#8217;s publication &#8216;Galina Balashova: Architect Of The Soviet Space Programme&#8217;, DOM Publishers, 2015</p>", "headline_credit": "Soviet Union, c. 1986", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Object", "is_on_display": true, "last_on_display_place": "ACMI: Gallery 1", "last_on_display_date": "2024-08-14", "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": null, "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Space architect Galina Balashova working</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Soviet Union, c. 1986</p>", "description": "", "description_for_label": [], "credit_line_for_label": "<p>Image reproduced from Philip Meuser&#8217;s publication &#8216;Galina Balashova: Architect Of The Soviet Space Programme&#8217;, DOM Publishers, 2015</p>", "details": [{"label": "Curatorial section", "display_values": ["The Story of the Moving Image&nbsp;→ Moving Worlds&nbsp;→ MW-02.

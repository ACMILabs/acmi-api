I was a very quiet, shy, retiring girl, and my mum brought me along to join the ladies&#8217; committee. We both joined at the same time. And I&#8217;ve been on the committee ever since.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>The ladies&#8217; committee is the main fundraiser for the club. We do a lot of catering. Over the years, we&#8217;ve done lots of weddings, and we&#8217;ll do anything to raise money, any sort of function that we can run in this room.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>We raise about $26,000 to $28,000, depending on what functions we have through the years. And the club, you know, they just couldn&#8217;t survive without that money.</p>\n<p>We have tea every Thursday night in the football season. We usually start the pre-season. All the players come in. Committees, supporters&#8212; anybody&#8217;s welcome. And home games, we just run the canteens. And I start early, about quarter past 7:00, every Saturday, and the others come in about 8:00.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>JAN ENDERS:  I&#8217;ve had three sons play over the years. And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back. I said, well, just get me some boots and I&#8217;ll be right.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:04:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

There was the joy of seeing Blak faces, but an unease in knowing non-Indigenous voyeurs likely captured the footage. In the vast network of archives in this country’s institutions, photos and videos of First Peoples are filed away, with the people who have been recorded – often unknowingly – and their descendants unaware the recordings exist.</p>\n<p>Jazz reclaims these images, combining them with stills from film and TV, including &#8220;The Phantom Stockman&#8221; (1953), &#8220;Radiance&#8221; (1998) and&#8221; The Drover’s Wife&#8221; (2021), in this large-scale photographic essay. It celebrates First Peoples representation and the Aboriginal scholars who critique this colonial hoarding, giving new meaning to images that have been dislocated by archival practices.

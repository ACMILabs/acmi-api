The film is ever-changing, as a different combination of footage is randomly selected for each screening with 1,344 possible variations. <i>The Beehive</i> therefore continually morphs and evolves to reveal different interpretations of this violent historical act and its social context.

The black and white negative images are projected on to screens suspended in the ceiling of the gallery, appearing as spinning astral bodies – a sparkling universe of whirling figures. There is a clear connection here to the <i>Planet &amp; Stars Sequence</i> and to <i>Parallel Forces</i>. Are these bodies orbiting each other?

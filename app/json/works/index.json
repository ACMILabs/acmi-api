Audio track was mixed by DJ Visitor (Andrew Till).</p>\n<p>This work is part of the Cyberthon Archive, generously donated to ACMI by Adem Jaffers.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details":

Wallace was particularly keen on capturing both the Australian landscape and the people who enjoyed it. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke.</p>\n<p>This film shows a trip to Wilson’s Promontory, Victoria including the beach at Tidal River and a group of people hiking around the prom.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights

"brief_description": "<p>The Raymond Penington Home Movie Collection is a collection of 16mm colour and black-and-white films made between 1938 and 1965. Dr. Raymond Penington (born 1903) was a medical doctor from Melbourne, Victoria. He and his wife Edith lived in Papua New Guinea in the late 1920s before returning to Melbourne in 1931 and settling in Canterbury. They had three children, Margaret, Vivienne and Jocelyn. His home movies focus on family life in Melbourne and holidays in regional Victoria.</p>\n<p>This film shows Dr Raymond Penington’s girls in the late 1930s and brief scenes of other members of the family.</p>\n<p>While the film is focused around his three daughters the main theme throughout is the youngest daughter, Jocelyn Penington.</p>\n<p>The film is located mainly in two places, the back yard at home and the beach, though there is a brief scene in the snow.

The filmmakers will be in touch with the major collectorof McGowan&#8217;s work in Adelaide; and there may be an opportunity to acquire the best of it for ACMI collections</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1333848, "name": "Scott Murray", "creator_id": 8326, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1333847, "name": "Scott Murray", "creator_id": 8326, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1333846, "name": "Paul Kallina", "creator_id": 8325, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1333845, "name": "Julie Marlow", "creator_id": 8324, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "1376", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "23 MAR 2002-30 JUN 2002", "notes": "", "to_year": "23 MAR 2002-30 JUN 2002"}], "labels": [48021]}, {"id": 108413, "acmi_id": "B1002824", "title": "Of day of night", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "of-day-of-night", "creator_credit": "Megan Heyward", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2001", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2001-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>This experimental interactive CD-ROM explores the intersections of narrative, subjectivity and interactivity.

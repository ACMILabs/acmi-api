Known as &#8216;mobiles&#8217; the sculptures had moveable parts, were light and delicate in form, and often included a mechanical motor. By the late 1950s, Calder had begun making &#8216;stabiles&#8217;, which retained the sense of lightness and dynamism of his smaller works, but were formed on a monumental scale and stable on the ground. &#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; is emblematic of this period of his work.</p>\n<p>&#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; was a gift to MIT by Eugene and Margaret McDermott, who were arts patrons and benefactors to the institute. The sculpture was fabricated in France and shipped to MIT in parts; made up of five panels bolted together, the sculpture is 40 feet tall and comprised of 33 tons of painted steel.</p>\n<p>The film features Calder overseeing the installation of &#8216;La Grande Voile&#8217; in the courtyard. Footage of the artist wearing a hard hat is overlaid with footage of workers piecing the sculpture together. The film emphasises the interplay between the curved lines and angles of the steel sheets, and the balance between the monolithic weight and its delicate legs.</p>\n<p>The film is accompanied by a recording of Bing Crosby&#8217;s &#8216;Dinah&#8217;, which is then spliced together with &#8216;Little Sir Echo&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration",

The collection contains Eidlitz&#8217;s experiments with light, movement and technology in film.</p>\n<p>This film focuses on Gyorgy Kepes, an influential Hungarian-American artist with whom Frank Eidlitz studied in 1966. Kepes, a professor at MIT, founded the Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in 1967 to facilitate the intersection between art, science and technology.</p>\n<p>Kepes was author of the books &#8216;The Language of Vision&#8217; (1944), &#8216;The New Landscape in Art and Science&#8217; (1956) and the six-volume series of essays &#8216;Vision and Value&#8217; (1965-1966). In 1965 he organised the exhibition &#8216;Light as a Creative Medium&#8217; at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Harvard University, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>The film, though silent, features Kepes speaking at a seminar. It includes title cards towards the beginning, including one introducing Gyorgy Kepes and another showing a brochure for a symposium accompanying the exhibition in January 1966. It also includes close-ups of Kepes&#8217; influential books, including editions in a variety of languages.</p>\n<p>The film then shows snippets of a trip to Kepes&#8217; holiday house near Long Pond in Cape Cod, including scenes of the lake nearby and the interior of the house. The house was designed by Kepes&#8217; friend and colleague Marcel Breuer, the renowned modernist architect.</p>\n<p>The final section of the film includes footage of the painting &#8216;Sleeping Venus&#8217; (1508-1510) traditionally attributed to the Italian Renaissance painter Giorgione, which is crossfaded into a shot of a nude woman in the same reclining pose. The film ends with images of Kepes working in his studio, his paintings stacked against the walls. The footage focuses on details of these paintings and elements of the artist&#8217;s studio, such as paintbrushes and tubes of paint.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label":

The collection contains Eidlitz&#8217;s experiments with light, movement and technology in film.</p>\n<p>This short film features Frank Eidlitz&#8217;s early experiments with light, colour and motion.</p>\n<p>To create these visuals, Eidlitz covered a series of disks with pieces of reflective paper and fluorescent colours, which he then placed on an apparatus that spun the disks at a high speed. The motion could be varied and stopped at any time, allowing the artist to create varying designs and images.</p>\n<p>This film opens with footage of a woman&#8217;s silhouette dancing, overlaid with flashing geometric shapes in red and green. The film then focuses on the woman&#8217;s face and subsequently the silhouette of her legs, exploring movement, shadow and light.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:26:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Cinematography - Lighting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art and technology", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Kinetic art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Movement in art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Movement, Aesthetics of", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Photography - Lighting", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Shades and shadows", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Video art", "Experimental", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Body, Human", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Art and technology", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Kinetic energy", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Light", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Light - Speed", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Shades and shadows", "Short films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Silent"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1765501, "name": "Frank Eidlitz", "creator_id": 86387, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [{"id": 2636, "name": "ACMI External Digital Access Copy", "uri": "https://youtu.be/kEW81ygWEWk"}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File;

Divorcee Helen McFarquar (Kate Capshaw), first to read the letter begins a steamy romance with the much younger Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who helps out in the bookstore where she works. The awakening of dormant feelings questions her to re-assess her relationship to George (Tom Selleck), an old friend from the past who has always been in love with her but lacks the eloquence and poetry of the letter. As the letter changes hands to Helen&#8217;s friend and co worker (Ellen DeGeneres), the local policeman, it alters their lives and those around them indelibly, and as Helen&#8217;s distant mother arrives back to Loblolly from overseas she discovers they have more in common than she realised. Cast also includes Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan. Based upon the novel by Cathleen Schine.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:23:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Self-actualization (Psychology)", "Literature&nbsp;→ Letter-writing", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1994960, "name": "Peter Ho-sun Chan", "creator_id": 32463, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q716064", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994959, "name": "Kate Capshaw", "creator_id": 79440, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q40162", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994958, "name": "Midge Sanford", "creator_id": 77500, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994957, "name": "Sarah Pillsbury", "creator_id": 19456, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1994956, "name": "NBCUniversal", "creator_id": 29454, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1994955, "name": "Video Bookshelf", "creator_id": 73358, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48028", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [30245], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90754, "acmi_id": "313764", "title": "The Flight of dragons", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-flight-of-dragons", "creator_credit": "Jules Bass, Arthur Rankin Jnr and Rankin-Bass Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1982", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Journey back to a magical time when the skies were filled with dragons in this feature-length animated version of Peter Dickinson&#8217;s acclaimed book.

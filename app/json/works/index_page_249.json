The films were made on Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film depicts a trip to Andamooka Opal Field in South Australia. Andamooka was established following the discovery of opal there in 1930, and largely consisted of scattered miners&#8217; camps. The film includes footage of the mines, the miners, the dugouts and shacks that comprised the settlement, and close-ups of opals in display cases.</p>\n<p>This film was made on Standard 8mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:29:00 bus ride through the South Australian outback<br />\n00:02:19:00 handpainted sign reading &#8216;Welcome to Andamooka Opal Field&#8217;<br />\n00:03:01:00 mine shafts<br />\n00:03:15:00 group of people examining the opal field, including a young girl in a pink pinafore<br />\n00:04:51:00 a mine shaft with pulley system<br />\n00:05:20:00 man skipping down the hill<br />\n00:05:33:00 the Andamooka Post Office<br />\n00:06:33:00 shanty structures<br />\n00:07:00:00 Aboriginal children playing<br />\n00:08:30:00 a man being hoisted out of a mine shaft<br />\n00:09:41:00 two miners chatting<br />\n00:10:11:00 close-ups of opals in display cases<br />\n00:12:26:00 sunset over the opal fields</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:12:48:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - Social conditions", "Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians - South Australia", "Agriculture, Business, Commerce & Industry&nbsp;→ Andamooka (S.

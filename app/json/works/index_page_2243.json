Ophuls&#8217; achievement above all is to lend weight to the slight story by his mise en scene and the substitution of turn of the century Paris for the novels&#8217; 1938 setting, which allows him to invoke a rigid social code of honour specific to the period. This renders the unnamed Madame de - vulnerable, in a way that the men are not, because she disobeys the code for love.

The film is viewed from the perspective of Blacky/Gary, a quiet, sensitive, and questioning youth who is best friends with football team mate Dumby Red, a brilliant aboriginal footballer and idealist, apparently unaffected by the animosity of older cousin Perry towards the whites. The status quo changes after a farcical grand final presentation in which one of the goonyas (whites) is selected over arguably Best on Ground Dumby. The football field proves the town&#8217;s racial arena whereby gunyas (blacks) are tolerated for their superior football prowess - off field, the small minded community is a pressure cooker of racism and hostilities which explode after a tragic event. Blacky&#8217;s relationship to Dumby&#8217;s sister Clarence also proves a point of contention with his abusive, belligerent and racist father. A thoughtful and passionate film, &#8220;Australian rules&#8221; was criticised in some sectors for being racist, it is however as much about friendship, intolerance, and life in an isolated community as it is about racism.

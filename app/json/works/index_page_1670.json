The story twists and turns until it reaches its tumultuous climactic end. Featuring stunning costumes in brilliant colors and spectacular stage sets, and supported by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra and Chorus conducted by world-renowned Lorin Maazel, this adaptation of &#8220;Turandot&#8221; is quite a visual experience. The internationally acclaimed lead singers each put in a magnificent performance and are strongly supported by Waldemar Kmentt (Altoum, Emperor of China), John Paul Bogart (Timur, vanquished King of Tartary) and Katia Ricciarelli (Liu the slave girl). Sung in Italian with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:19:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Italian"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Foreign language films", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Operas - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Performing arts", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 915869, "name": "Rodney Greenberg", "creator_id": 21942, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915868, "name": "Harold Prince", "creator_id": 36465, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 915867, "name": "Osterreichischer Rundfunk-Fernsehen", "creator_id": 15352, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 915866, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS;

However as the days go by, Anna finds herself inextricably caught up with Dostoyvesky&#8217;s imagination and the story he is creating - a tale of a young couple at the Casino in the fictional German resort Roulettenburg where the young man&#8217;s gambling obsession has put him into debt. The intertwining of reality and fiction eventually leads to a strange erotic attraction between Dostoyevsky and Anna. In real life, Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina became Dostoyvesky&#8217;s second wife and it is her written reminiscences that have allowed a glimpse into Dostoyevsky&#8217;s creative life and the eventual making of this film. Screenplay by Katharine Ogden, Charles Cohen and Nick Dear. Cast also includes Polly Walker, Dominic West, John Wood, Johan Leysen, Angeline Ball, Luise Rainer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Biographical", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Erotica", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hungary", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Netherlands", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Historical films", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Literature&nbsp;→ Creative writing, Fiction", "Literature&nbsp;→ Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821-1881", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature", "Literature&nbsp;→ Russian literature - Film and video adaptations", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "People&nbsp;→ Dostoyevsky, Fyodor, 1821-1881", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2349743, "name": "Karoly Makk", "creator_id": 32177, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1046993", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2349735, "name": "Charles Cohen", "creator_id": 80159, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121091045", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2349740, "name": "Marc Vlessing", "creator_id": 80160, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121079072", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2349727, "name": "Gambler Productions", "creator_id": 34842, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121126172", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2349728, "name": "Hungry Eye Lowland", "creator_id": 34843, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121159734", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2349732, "name": "Objektiv Filmstudio Vallalat", "creator_id": 25130, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50688", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32656]}, {"id": 93151, "acmi_id": "316530", "title": "The Fury", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-fury", "creator_credit": "Brian De Palma, Frank Yablans and Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1978", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1978-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 43789, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q626851"}], "brief_description": "<p>Brian De Palma&#8217;s &#8220;The Fury&#8221; is a schizophrenic genre fusion of horror, action, political intrigue and supernatural thriller.

Potter&#8217;s film is divided into twelve lessons during which the two protagonists learn about each other, fight over who is leading who, start a love story, and eventually end up in Buenos Aires to learn from the tango masters. The film is shot mostly in black and white, except for some dream sequences in which Sally fantasizes about an ill-fated film project. Veron performs many modern dance numbers, including tap and ballroom dancing, as part of his tango repertoire.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:37:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture authorship", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Production and direction", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dance in motion pictures, television, etc.", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Tango (Dance)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997158, "name": "Sally Potter", "creator_id": 61866, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q268840", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997157, "name": "Christopher Sheppard", "creator_id": 61871, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q28784798", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997156, "name": "Neue Deutsche Filmgesellschaft", "creator_id": 28109, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997154, "name": "OKCK Films", "creator_id": 32061, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997155, "name": "PIE", "creator_id": 32062, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1997153, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50674", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32647]}, {"id": 93142, "acmi_id": "316520", "title": "The Claim", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-claim-dvd", "creator_credit": "Michael Winterbottom, Andrew Eaton and United Artists Corporation", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46295, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1170157"}], "brief_description": "<p>Directed by Michael Winterbottom (Butterfly kiss, Wonderland, 24 hour party people), &#8220;The Claim&#8221; is an adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel &#8220;The Mayor of Casterbridge&#8221;.

Jacques Baratier and Jean Valere have captured Paris nightlife in 1956 featuring its streets and inhabitants, cabarets, Chansonniers and other entertainments, its lights and edifices. As the night progresses, Parisians return to their homes and venues close as markets prepare to open. Excellent cinematography by Maurice Barry. A film without dialogue, incorporating songs in its soundtrack.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:22:45:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cities and towns - France", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ France - Social life and customs", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - France", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - France", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music-halls (Variety-theaters, cabarets, etc.)", "Places&nbsp;→ Cities and towns - France", "Places&nbsp;→ Paris (France)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - France"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 895377, "name": "Argos Films", "creator_id": 69972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 895378, "name": "Como Films", "creator_id": 71650, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 895379, "name": "Jacques Baratier", "creator_id": 75179, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2574674", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 895380, "name": "Jean Valere", "creator_id": 75180, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3174949", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "27038", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1956", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1956"}], "labels": [10854], "external_references": [{"id": 2926, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q16668990"}]}]}

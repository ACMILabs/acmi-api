The film is designed as an introduction to McLaren&#8217;s animated productions. An oscilloscope records what various sounds look like - the trembling strings of a guitar, the low tones of a tuba, the crow of a rooster and the human speaking voice. Norman McLaren then demonstrates on a moviola the sounds that emit from a soundtrack on which he has drawn dots, lines and triangles and we note how these sounds are synchronised with the artist&#8217;s hand-drawn animations. (6 mins.) Written by Don Peter. Photographed by Lorne C. Batchelor. Music by Louis Applebaum. (Award: Venice). The second part presents Norman McLaren&#8217;s experimental film &#8216;Dots&#8217; made in 1948 which demonstrates his innovative technique and illustrates what can be created by drawing directly onto the picture and soundtrack area of film stock.

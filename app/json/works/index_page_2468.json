Cast includes Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Cynthia Stevenson.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:14:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Black comedy", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Pedophilia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Suburbs", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Fathers and sons", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Pedophilia", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suburban life", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suburbs"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993776, "name": "Todd Solondz", "creator_id": 78647, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q504656", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993775, "name": "Christine Vachon", "creator_id": 51131, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q436847", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993774, "name": "Ted Hope", "creator_id": 77844, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q7693309", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993772, "name": "Good Machine International", "creator_id": 31434, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993773, "name": "Killer Films", "creator_id": 71715, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46635", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [29006]}, {"id": 89514, "acmi_id": "312318", "title": "Girl 6 = Girl six", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "girl-6-girl-six", "creator_credit": "Spike Lee, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks and Fox Searchlight Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1996", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1996-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 53017, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q2517431"}], "brief_description": "<p>Theresa Randle is an attractive and talented actress but her inability to find acting work leads her to get a job working as a sex-phone operator.

The venues cover the plush and gilt interior of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, the magnificent Teatro alla Scala, Milan and Arena di Verona, and the more intimate surroundings of Glyndebourne where Opera and picturesque English countryside make for a pleasant harmony. Sumptuous costumes, glimmering jewels, spectacular sets and spine tingling song all add up to an unforgettable experience. Dame Kiri relates some of the experiences she has encountered as an opera singer. Placido Domingo demonstrates his versatility when he conducts the orchestra in a performance of Die Fledermaus and also provides the occasion for some comic relief.

The doctor takes him on as a patient and through their therapy sessions Don Juan recounts his many romantic adventures and conquests. At first sceptical of the mans sanity, Dr. Mickler is gradually seduced by Don Juan&#8217;s outlandish tales of love, leading him to question the fictional nature of his stories and the man&#8217;s real identity.

It begins with the narrator&#8217;s train journey from London to Reading where Robinson has asked him to join a project he has been commissioned to research on &#8216;the problem of England&#8217;. The space of the title is the sprawl of England that Robinson and his companion traverse on a series of journeys. They visit industrial estates, ports and heritage sites examining English culture, its absences and decline, and the industrial economy. At the core of the film is the monologue where Robinson&#8217;s digressions and insights are juxtaposed over quotidian images of contemporary Britain.

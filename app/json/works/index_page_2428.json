Dialogue is pared down to a minimum; instead the camera observes its characters framed against the contrasting urban sprawl of Tokyo and the windswept coast of rural Japan. The meditative and richly poetic mise-en-scene explores the importance of environment, nature and landscape in defining a person&#8217;s relationship to the world. Recalling the films of Japan&#8217;s celebrated director Ozu, &#8220;Maborosi&#8221; is a deeply affecting and richly rewarding art film which reaffirms that cinema too can be a place for the creation of transcendental and spiritual works that assist in defining that complex, ambiguous phenomena which is the human condition.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:50:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "Japanese"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Landscape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Death", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Japan - Rural conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Grief", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Japan", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Death", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Grief", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Marriage", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Spirituality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Suicide", "Foreign language films", "Places&nbsp;→ Tokyo (Japan)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1995771, "name": "Hirokazu Koreeda", "creator_id": 79762, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q740758", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995770, "name": "Kore-eda", "creator_id": 79761, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995769, "name": "Naoe Gozu", "creator_id": 33482, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1995768, "name": "TV Man Union", "creator_id": 33454, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299109", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "49722", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [31782]}, {"id": 92291, "acmi_id": "315523", "title": "I Stand alone = Seul contre tous (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-stand-alone-seul-contre-tous-d", "creator_credit": "Gaspar Noe, Lucile Hadzihalilovic, Alliance Atlantis and Les Cinemas de la Zone", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1998", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 44223, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q631936"}], "brief_description": "<p>An unemployed butcher returns to his native Paris after having bashed his lover and forced her to miscarriage.

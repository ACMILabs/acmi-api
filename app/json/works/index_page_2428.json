Far from accomplishing his task, Zhao Gou is taken hostage and held to ransom, shattering the last hopes of amnesty toward China&#8217;s devastated population. A Shaolin Kung Fu warrior Li Ma, known commonly as the &#8220;Flying Magic Mouse&#8221; (&#8220;飞天神鼠&#8221;), leads the local rebellion against the Jin in an effort to rescue the kidnapped envoy Zhao Gou.

In order to avoid arousing the suspicions of the Jin, and to vouch safe the escape of Li Ma and the envoy, Mai Shan jumps onto the sword of Li Ma when he is ordered by the Jin to kill her.<br />\nWith Mai&#8217;s death and Li Ma&#8217;s dazzling exhibitions of martial prowess, the Jin are ecstatic that Li Ma has come over to their side, and drop their guard enough for Li Ma to smuggle Zhao Gou out of the stronghold.

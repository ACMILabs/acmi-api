The thief, Ismael (Karra Elejalde) is interrupted during a robbery when the woman of the house unexpectedly returns. Without any hesitation, Ismael proceeds to cold-bloodedly kill the woman and only as he makes his escape does he realise that the murder has been silently witnessed by the woman&#8217;s young daughter, Leire. Many years later Leire (Ana Alvarez) and Ismael&#8217;s paths cross. Terrified that he may be exposed by the truth, Ismael decides to kidnap Leire and hold her prisoner in his derelict squat, much to his girlfriend Maite&#8217;s (Lio) annoyance and frustration. Leire, however, having been traumatised by the witnessing of her mother&#8217;s murder, has grown up as a mute. As Ismael&#8217;s interest in Liere turns from fear to an almost obsessive attraction, Liere unwittingly finds herself becoming part of a complex and dangerous love triangle, which can only lead to a twisted and violent conclusion, particularly in light of Maite&#8217;s extreme jealousy towards Leire. A film of suspense and intrigue peppered with moments of dark humour and acted by a superb cast including Silvia Marso, Elena Irureta, Ramon Barea.

Arriving on her first morning, she greets the children pleasantly. Outside the classroom, Madame Wang meets Mr. Lin, a former schoolmate of hers who also teaches at the school. He reminds her that, despite her previous jobs, at this school she must be strict.<br />\nDespite Mr. Lin&#8217;s recommendations, Madame Wang teaches her students in an anti-disciplinary manner. She treats her students as equals, even playing a ball game with them during recess. While Mr. Lin berates his class for failing a math test, which has &#8220;brought down the honour of the school&#8221;,  Madame Wang teaches her class valuable life skills that will serve the students in the real world. Mr. Lin forces the failing students to create a study team to better their scores. Madame Wang, however, brings fun into study by encouraging the students to name their study teams.<br />\nTwo Americans, Miss Samina and Mr Brown, meet with the Secretary for Foreign Affairs to discuss how to encourage students to learn better.<br />\nThe students assemble in Lu Xun Park for a group meeting, but end up bickering childishly. The next day in class, Mr. Lin appears to be in a lot of pain. Madame Wang encourages the students to reform the group. Over lunch in the staff room, Mr. Lin asks Madame Wang to discourage the students from reforming their study groups. She refuses, stating that, on the contrary, she will motivate them continue. Although this upsets Mr. Lin, they agree to co-operate with each other.<br />\nThe students become increasingly mischievous, quarrelsome and unproductive. They oppose the amount of extra curricular activities required of them, admitting they are exhausted by the time they finish their homework. Madame Wang and Mr. Lin decide to take the students on a field trip, hoping to reinvigorate them. They appear excited by the prospect.<br />\nMadame Wang worries that she has accepted too much of a workload, and that she is neglecting her home life. When she returns home that evening, her husband, apparently a stay at home dad, tells her that she dedicates herself too much to her work. Her daughter, Lingling, meanwhile, has fallen ill. Although Lingling desperately needs her mother, Madame Wang takes her students on the field trip she promised. While her husband respects her dedication to the job, he misses her at home and does not appreciate having to do all the household chores. She must stop trying to revolutionise the education system all by herself. The teacher is afraid of the toll that her job is beginning to take on her home life. Madame Wang worries about the toll that her new job is beginning to take on her home life.<br />\nThe next day the class takes a field trip to the zoo. Unable to contain their excitement, the children engage in a range of social-skill-building activities such as orienteering and group work. When one of the students is injured, Mr. Lin blames Madame Wang for taking the students out of the classroom and trying to turn them into something more than the bookworms they should be.<br />\nWhen Madame Wang returns home late that night, her husband has locked himself and their daughter inside one of the bedrooms in an attempt to convince her to come home earlier. The act sends her into a deep depression.<br />\nLi Xiaochun, a male pupil, is berated by Mr. Lin for painting the sea red in one of his drawings instead of blue, &#8220;like it should be&#8221;. He blames Madame Wang giving the children creative freedom. Later that day, Madame Wang discovers that Mr. Lin is gravely ill with a stomach ulcer. Although his doctor has told him to rest, he continues to work, leading her to believe that he cares more about his students that he wishes to let on. Although he is strict, he is kind-hearted and loving. The school forces him to take time off. The children miss him.<br />\nMiss Samina and Mr Brown gather a number of local primary schools to challenge the students to an international intelligence test. The test involves 5 students, each holding a piece of string, in a race to pull 5 glass balloons out of a bottle with a narrow neck. The first pupil to pull their balloon out of the bottle wins. Naturally, however, the students all pull their strings at once, and the balloons remain stuck in the bottleneck. Li Xiaochun, Mr. Lin&#8217;s creative student, has an ingenious idea, which he whispers to the rest of the class. When Miss Samina blows the whistle, the group pulls the balls out effortlessly, one at a time in turn. They win the competition. Madame Wang and Mr. Lin admire them proudly. The group dedicates its award to their teachers. THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:<br />\nColoured Balloons explores the shifting gender dynamics of (then) contemporary China. While the lead female character works – and is her family&#8217;s main breadwinner – her husband stays at home and looks after the household and their daughter. The film, however, is subtly critical of this shift, demonstrating the consequences of a neglecting mother.

A new teacher in the School, Mr Gao visits the family to explain the decision to exclude him and the teacher and student develop a strong friendship. Jianjun and Mr Gao create a secret symbol, a circle with an exclaimation mark inside it and call it ‘a distress signal’ that they can use if needed. Mr Gao is an unconventional teacher, allowing students to write a composition about performing at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, at Jianjun’s request.</p>\n<p>The anticipation of the Asian Games is heightened throughout the month of September as the children continue to practice their Wushu and as lottery tickets are bought and sold. Jianjun and his friends purchase two tickets. Qinglai’s ticket is not a winner, whilst Jianjun peels open the ticket to find that he has won 50 yuan. Amid the hysteria of the children’s voices, he donates the money to the games and immediately runs away. The boys are followed by a journalist who later writes up the story for the Beijing evening paper. Unfortunately the details that she gathers mistakenly describe Qinglai as the winner and selfless hero and Jianjun is sidelined. The shameless Qinglai is celebrated at a School assembly and awarded a prize. After reading the newspaper article Qinglai’s family takes him out for a ‘Western style’ dinner. But the balance begins to fall in Jianjun’s favour as, after a series of misunderstandings, Qinglai’s family buys tickets to visit the grandfather in Taiwan with the plane set to depart on exactly the day of the opening ceremony. A space opens up on the Wushu team and a competiton is held. Gradually, all other competitors lose their balance, or can’t quite keep up with the rhythm and pace of the performance and Jianjun performs perfectly. He is admitted back into the Wushu group. The penultimate images of My September celebrate the birth of the baby. Sunlight falls onto the edges of his face as he is welcomed home. But the absolute ending features beautiful images of the children demonstrating their Wushu skills on mass in the middle of the stadium, with Jianjun filmed, heroically, from a low angle, an expanse of blue sky behind him. His dream of being called up for the team has been fulfilled.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651333, "name": "Yin Li", "creator_id": 82818, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2082279", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651336, "name": "Zhan Qiang", "creator_id": 82544, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315538", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651332, "name": "Ming Liu", "creator_id": 82817, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270848", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651331, "name": "China Children's Film Studio", "creator_id": 82816, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337007", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651335, "name": "Luo Chensheng", "creator_id": 82403, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222568", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651334, "name": "Xiaoou Du", "creator_id": 82819, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357429", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651341, "name": "Danping Shen", "creator_id": 82824, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299143", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651339, "name": "Guoli Zhang", "creator_id": 82822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651338, "name": "Meng Zhang", "creator_id": 82821, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035925", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651340, "name": "Zeru Tao", "creator_id": 82823, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651342, "name": "Zhang Yin", "creator_id": 82825, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315011", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651337, "name": "Weiguang Liu", "creator_id": 82820, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146475", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [55321]}, {"id": 115826, "acmi_id": "Z000090", "title": "The Magic flying mouse = Fei tian shen shu", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-magic-flying-mouse-fei-tian-shen-shu", "creator_credit": "Wang Wei, Qi Hai and Pearl River Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The tale is based around the historical period of decline of the illustrious Northern Song Dynasty (Chinese: 北宋, 960–1127), which saw China&#8217;s borders fall under the military might of the armies of the Jin.

Although it is too late to prevent the flooding, the Mayor promises to find a solution as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Tempers shorten as the residents try desperately to save their property.

Unfortunately, however, Liu Shan has cancer, and only has a week to live. The Mayor visits her in hospital, thanking her for her great work and promising her the best medical care in the world to help her recover. She is grateful to receive the recognition she deserves.</p>\n<p>At the opening ceremony for the Flyover, the workers are denied entry for being too sloppily dressed. Despite all their hard work, they are given no recognition. When the Mayor finds out, he visits the workers, insisting they all cut the ribbon together. Suring the ceremony, the Mayor reflects on the city&#8217;s great achievements but laments that the designer (Liu Shan) could not be there to see her finished product. THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>This film is incredibly unique. While it has a discernible plot and knowable characters, it plays out like a kind of advertisement, illustrating a newly modern Shanghai while praising the great achievements of the Chinese Government who made it happen. It paints a positive portrait of the Chinese Government as a body whose chief aim is the wellbeing of its people. The film suggests the Government is willing to pull up their sleeves and work alongside the masses.</p>\n<p>Shanghai&#8217;s modernity is made evident in the large number of establishing shots of the city, the added voiceover providing a highly propagandistic commentary on its beauty.</p>\n<p>The film is also imbued with a Communist touch. Subtly critical of capitalist ambition, it suggests that men should work for a cause and not just to be paid.<br />\n(2 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 28, 2012)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>A 1990 big city = Da Cheng shi</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Sun Sha and Changchun Film Studio</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1990</p>", "description": "<p>A slice of life portrait of Shanghai in 1990 that illustrates its many and varied people, and their daily struggles.

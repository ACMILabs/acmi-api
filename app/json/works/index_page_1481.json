Monkey hears his master is in trouble and infiltrates the witch&#8217;s cave in a clever disguise to defeat the forces of evil.</p>\n<p>The tale of  &#8220;Journey to the West&#8221; is long and has seen many representations in both literature and film. However this film is the classic tradition of animation representing the Monkey King which were developed early in China&#8217;s film history. The film is adapted particularly young audiences, but is often considered a viewing pleasure regardless of age.

The difficulty of children’s culture is depicted by some of the cruelty and ridicule that Jianjun endures. He is described by his peers as having difficulty articulating his thoughts, literally talking to people. His nickname, Grand Folly An, is just one of many humiliations that he must survive. He is blamed for stealing Song’s knickerbockers from the clothesline, when the idea was proposed by Qinglai who imagines her her kicking upwards during tomorrow’s exercises. The pivotal indignity, however, is that he is eliminated from the school’s Wushu demonstration planned for the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. A new teacher in the School, Mr Gao visits the family to explain the decision to exclude him and the teacher and student develop a strong friendship. Jianjun and Mr Gao create a secret symbol, a circle with an exclaimation mark inside it and call it ‘a distress signal’ that they can use if needed. Mr Gao is an unconventional teacher, allowing students to write a composition about performing at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, at Jianjun’s request.</p>\n<p>The anticipation of the Asian Games is heightened throughout the month of September as the children continue to practice their Wushu and as lottery tickets are bought and sold. Jianjun and his friends purchase two tickets. Qinglai’s ticket is not a winner, whilst Jianjun peels open the ticket to find that he has won 50 yuan. Amid the hysteria of the children’s voices, he donates the money to the games and immediately runs away. The boys are followed by a journalist who later writes up the story for the Beijing evening paper. Unfortunately the details that she gathers mistakenly describe Qinglai as the winner and selfless hero and Jianjun is sidelined. The shameless Qinglai is celebrated at a School assembly and awarded a prize. After reading the newspaper article Qinglai’s family takes him out for a ‘Western style’ dinner. But the balance begins to fall in Jianjun’s favour as, after a series of misunderstandings, Qinglai’s family buys tickets to visit the grandfather in Taiwan with the plane set to depart on exactly the day of the opening ceremony. A space opens up on the Wushu team and a competiton is held. Gradually, all other competitors lose their balance, or can’t quite keep up with the rhythm and pace of the performance and Jianjun performs perfectly. He is admitted back into the Wushu group. The penultimate images of My September celebrate the birth of the baby. Sunlight falls onto the edges of his face as he is welcomed home. But the absolute ending features beautiful images of the children demonstrating their Wushu skills on mass in the middle of the stadium, with Jianjun filmed, heroically, from a low angle, an expanse of blue sky behind him. His dream of being called up for the team has been fulfilled.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Chinese", "English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Martial arts films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - China", "Foreign language films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Martial arts films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2651333, "name": "Yin Li", "creator_id": 82818, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2082279", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651336, "name": "Zhan Qiang", "creator_id": 82544, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315538", "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651332, "name": "Ming Liu", "creator_id": 82817, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121270848", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651331, "name": "China Children's Film Studio", "creator_id": 82816, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337007", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651335, "name": "Luo Chensheng", "creator_id": 82403, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121222568", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2651334, "name": "Xiaoou Du", "creator_id": 82819, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121357429", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2651341, "name": "Danping Shen", "creator_id": 82824, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121299143", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651339, "name": "Guoli Zhang", "creator_id": 82822, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651338, "name": "Meng Zhang", "creator_id": 82821, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121035925", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651340, "name": "Zeru Tao", "creator_id": 82823, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651342, "name": "Zhang Yin", "creator_id": 82825, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315011", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2651337, "name": "Weiguang Liu", "creator_id": 82820, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146475", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 4, "name": "China", "slug": "china"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [55321]}, {"id": 115826, "acmi_id": "Z000090", "title": "The Magic flying mouse = Fei tian shen shu", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-magic-flying-mouse-fei-tian-shen-shu", "creator_credit": "Wang Wei, Qi Hai and Pearl River Film Studio", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "China, 1990", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1990-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The tale is based around the historical period of decline of the illustrious Northern Song Dynasty (Chinese: 北宋, 960–1127), which saw China&#8217;s borders fall under the military might of the armies of the Jin.

The remaining ministers, however, remain stuck in severe traffic, causing them to be late to the meeting. The men complain about the daily morning congestion in Shanghai. The meeting at the mayor&#8217;s office commences. They watch a video showing the daily public transport and congestion issues of life in Shanghai. They discuss the amount of time citizens waste year after year commuting back and forth from work. Elderly residents are shown living in inconvenient high-rise apartments to avoid the risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jinghua fixes a wheelchair for his invalid aunty in the extreme heat while his mother looks after his young son. Aunt Chen is wheeled through the residential laneway where she lives on the wheelchair.

An open-minded and caring man, he looks after the masses.</p>\n<p>A violent thunderstorm hits and the vulnerable housing areas are completely flooded. While residents try frantically to stop the water, the council meets to discuss how to halt the flooding. They discover that the flooding has occurred because the area&#8217;s drainage system has not been repaired for 34 years. Furious, the mayor promises he will lead an investigation to discover why the system has been neglected. Although it is too late to prevent the flooding, the Mayor promises to find a solution as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Tempers shorten as the residents try desperately to save their property. Several days pass, but the water refuses to subside. The council begins to panic. The Mayor fires Liu Shan, a female minister, believing her to be too young to effectively perform her role.</p>\n<p>Secretary Gao, an older member of the council, asks his daughter Gao Jie about her relationship with Mayor Zhang Yimin.

Residents whose houses were destroyed by the flood are given new housing by the council.

When the Mayor visits the complex, however, he discovers that selfish council members and their families have begun to move into the apartments, although they were intended for those whose houses were damaged by the flood. Disgusted, he throws them out. Meanwhile, the residents prepare for the move. Thoroughly excited, they secretly curse the municipal cadres for being selfish.</p>\n<p>The site workers protest their long working hours. They were promised more pay for more work, but did not receive it. Their supervisor is enraged, calling them selfish, working only for a bonus and not for the cause, like men used to in the past.</p>\n<p>The council discusses the construction of the freeway flyover. They praise the constructions design as innovative, thinking it similar to a lotus flower. The men are shocked to discover the designer is none other than Liu Shan. Unfortunately, however, Liu Shan has cancer, and only has a week to live. The Mayor visits her in hospital, thanking her for her great work and promising her the best medical care in the world to help her recover. She is grateful to receive the recognition she deserves.</p>\n<p>At the opening ceremony for the Flyover, the workers are denied entry for being too sloppily dressed. Despite all their hard work, they are given no recognition. When the Mayor finds out, he visits the workers, insisting they all cut the ribbon together. Suring the ceremony, the Mayor reflects on the city&#8217;s great achievements but laments that the designer (Liu Shan) could not be there to see her finished product. THE END.</p>\n<p>Cultural History of the Film:</p>\n<p>This film is incredibly unique. While it has a discernible plot and knowable characters, it plays out like a kind of advertisement, illustrating a newly modern Shanghai while praising the great achievements of the Chinese Government who made it happen. It paints a positive portrait of the Chinese Government as a body whose chief aim is the wellbeing of its people. The film suggests the Government is willing to pull up their sleeves and work alongside the masses.</p>\n<p>Shanghai&#8217;s modernity is made evident in the large number of establishing shots of the city, the added voiceover providing a highly propagandistic commentary on its beauty.</p>\n<p>The film is also imbued with a Communist touch.

Told mainly in flashback, the film begins with Lola as the main attraction in a circus where the audience pay to ask her questions about her nefarious past. Ophuls trademark roving camera and opulent set design are serviced well by the cinemascope frame, while the bold use of colour imbues the film with a vibrant dreamlike quality. However it&#8217;s the fallen Lola, her life reduced to a grand sideshow spectacle that carries the most resonance, a potent metaphor for a filmmaker whose main body of work was one grand tribute after another to passionate women ruined by love.

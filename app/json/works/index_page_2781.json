This documentary however focuses on James Dean the man, rather than his image. It is an illuminating look at the actor&#8217;s life seen through the eyes of friends, family and work colleagues. The testimonials are frank and thought provoking, and there is rare footage of TV commercials and telemovies that Dean had featured in.

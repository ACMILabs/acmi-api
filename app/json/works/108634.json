A cross between the world&#8217;s smallest cinema and largest photobooth with a companion Boothsite that can take the portraits of Booth visitors generated by the encounter and admit them into a growing, online, interactive community of Booth visitors.<br />\nIt is a coin-operated vending machine that vends cinema itself and, like the black and white photobooth, provides its visitors with a take away souvenir record of their encounter in the form of a photographic portrait. It includes an evolving soundscape that shifts as day turns to night, enlivened by lighting that plays over and under the 120 mother of pearl discs in the Booth&#8217;s shell.</p>",

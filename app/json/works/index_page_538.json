In the final episode of this series, &#8220;Future of Trees&#8221;, Dick considers the modern usage of trees by looking at the versatility of Willows and their prudent use as opposed to the exploitation of the Redwoods in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["03:44:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Agriculture - Environmental aspects", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Botany", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Botany - Ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Conservation of natural resources", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environmental education", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Environmental protection - Citizen participation", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Forest ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Garden ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Island ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Landscape gardening", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Mountain ecology", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Natural history", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Plant conservation", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Plant-water relationships", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Tree felling", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Tree planting", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Trees", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Wood-carving", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Great Britain", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Instructional", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2466061, "name": "Acacia Productions", "creator_id": 34188, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50034", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [32045]}, {"id": 73093, "acmi_id": "322838", "title": "Sperm cell development in the grasshopper", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "sperm-cell-development-in-the-grasshopper", "creator_credit": "Kurt Michel", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1935", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1935-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>This film is chiefly interesting as an example of the use of film in the service of science, in this case, microcinematography.

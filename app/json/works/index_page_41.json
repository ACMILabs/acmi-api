The film contains three distinct sections: the first focusing on the principles for lifting heavy objects; the second showing different methods for lifting patients in the hospital; and the third showing methods for manoeuvring heavy loads such as shovelling material and pushing a trolley.</p>\n<p>The first section includes animated sections showing the anatomy of the spine and the different types of back injury, including slipped disks, muscle and ligament strain. It then outlines the steps for lifting a heavy load, focusing on a truck driver loading various objects onto the tray of his vehicle.</p>\n<p>The second section is directed at hospital staff, as an instructional video for lifting patients correctly.

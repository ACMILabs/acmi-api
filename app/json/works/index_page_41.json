Football Clubs were driven to merge into the Orbost Snowy Rovers. This is a story of small town trauma and redemption.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Peter Jenkins, Edna Towns, Rita Baker, Gary Squires, and Glen Davie. Archival video and still images reproduced courtesy of Orbost Snowy Rovers Football Club and &#8220;The Snowy River Mail&#8221;.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[INTERPOSING VOICES] PETER JENKINS:  I think from background&#8212; well, the Snowy Rovers have always been very much a working-class team. A lot of the guys worked out in the bush, worked in the mills, you know, that line of work, physical hard, physical work, sort of went and played at the Snowy Rovers, whereas the bank people, the accountants and schoolteachers, all tended to come to the Orbost footy club. And it was pretty full-on rivalry.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>[WHISTLE BLOWS]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS:  Friday nights, I think you would have found that Rovers went up to the top hotel and the Orbost boys went down to the bottom hotel. You probably went to one butcher if he was a member of the Rovers, or a member of the Orbost, say, you went to him.</p>\n<p>But it was really one eyed football, wasn&#8217;t it? But then once football was over, we were all friends again, because we all live in the same town, after all, don&#8217;t we? And we all have to live here.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>RITA BAKER: Saturdays, your friends became your enemies.</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: Yes.</p>\n<p>RITA BAKER: And the barracking at the football, Orbost used to be down one end, and the Rovers would be at the other end of the ground, and never the twain should meet. Otherwise it was on.</p>\n<p>[HORNS HONKING]</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: They started to talk about amalgamation. Some agreed. Some didn&#8217;t. At first, I was against it, because you don&#8217;t like giving up your main team. But eventually we had to, because we knew if we didn&#8217;t join, we wouldn&#8217;t have a team.</p>\n<p>Mainly because young ones were going away for employment, going to college, university, and getting jobs. There was no jobs here. Everything was closing down in the town. So that&#8217;s why we sort of had to join up .</p>\n<p>PETER JENKINS: Prior to the merger, the only times both clubs had full numbers was when we were playing each other. We would go away and play advanced, and kids would end up playing thirds. Under-17s and them would play reserves. And there&#8217;d be reserves players played reserves, and then played seniors, because you really struggled. And you know, it was becoming quite embarrassing.</p>\n<p>EDNA TOWNS: A little bit like a religion. You know, you change your religion, more or less, when you&#8217;re closing down one club and going to something different. And that&#8217;s how it felt. And probably Rita felt the same. You know, you&#8217;re losing all those years that you were with one club.</p>\n<p>It was hard at first. It was hard for me to go down into the Orbost sheds.

the aftermath.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Swifts Creek Football Club, ABC Gippsland (Photography Gerard Callinan) and Gordon Bock.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>My first game in 1936 we had to go to Benambra and apparently there were very, very hard feelings between Swifts Creek and Benambra. It came over from the Grand Final the year before, which Swifts Creek won. I came here in September ’35 and they’re still celebrating their win against Benambra and apparently Benambra weren’t happy about it. So, I thought next year, first game next year was out at Benambra and it was sort of an evening up job…</p>\n<p>Got to nearly half time an’ developed into a general brawl. I was playing on the wing and I was lucky, my opponent he wasn’t too keen to go in and neither was I, so we looked on. And I thought “By Jesus, they play fair dinkum over ‘ere”. I think there were over ten blokes rubbed out and I think the umpire was alto rubbed out and scrubbed. He happened to be a local bloke here, an’ he’s a great mate of mine but I’d say is the worst umpire I ever seen in my life. He completely lost control of the game altogether. One bloke got rubbed out for life, he was reported for kicking the umpire, somebody kicked the umpire and quite candidly I think he needed kicking meself.

And I get on well with the ladies, so I&#8217;ll turn up and help. We never miss the footy. We like away games because we can watch. Home games, I have most to do with the lolly stall and keeping the drinks in the fridge and backing up in the kitchen. We sometimes see the last quarter. Don&#8217;t see much else.</p>\n<p>[SEWING MACHINE WHIRRING]</p>\n<p>I do all the sewing, and if there&#8217;s any repairs, I take them home, bring them back Saturday morning. Our thirds and reserves won last year, and we&#8217;ve always let them have their jumpers. So you order your jumpers very early and you don&#8217;t know what players you&#8217;re going to have in sizes. So I&#8217;ve probably sewed on 100 numbers prior to the start of the season.</p>\n<p>ROE HARRAP:  I started off going with a guy who played here, ended up marrying him, and now my children are playing here. So yeah, it really is a family affair.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>Women are at backbone s of the football club here. I believe that women play a huge role in country football. And particularly here, if he didn&#8217;t have the women behind the club, they wouldn&#8217;t be where they are now.</p>\n<p>[PLATES CLATTERING]</p>\n<p>VAL DOMINELLI:  Oh, I love the club, and I love all the people. We&#8217;re all good friends. Actually, last week we were very short in the seconds. I got named as an emergency on the bench.</p>\n<p>[LAUGHTER]</p>\n<p>But this way, I think I got more players back.

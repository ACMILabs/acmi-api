In &#8220;Alphaville&#8221; the hero, played by Eddie Constantine with an embittered edge, evoking the ghost of Philipe Marlowe, has a mission to eliminate an eminent professor, the inventor of Alpha 60, a superior computer that governs society. The professor&#8217;s daughter, Natasha, played with an alluringly demure sensuality by Anna Karina, is the detective&#8217;s guide and also his love interest as he negotiates the bizarre, totalitarian state. Godard&#8217;s narrative is littered with numerous references, in particular, Aldous Huxley&#8217;s &#8220;Brave New World&#8221; and George Orwell&#8217;s &#8220;1984&#8221;. Godard uses the modernist 1960 Paris aesthetic to great effect, succeeding in presenting the city as a glimmering, ominous prison, where absurd and inhumane policies intermingle. Several memorable sequences include a firing squad - a cultural performance, accompanied by elegant water ballet sequences - that is witnessed by an admiring audience. An unusual addition to the canon of French New Wave cinema. Glorious black and white cinematography by Raoul Coutard. In French with English subtitles.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Detective and mystery films", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Totalitarianism", "Fantasy & Science Fiction", "Fantasy & Science Fiction&nbsp;→ Science fiction films", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "History&nbsp;→ Technology and civilization", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Dystopias", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Computers", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Future life", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Technology and civilization"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/alphaville", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1977147, "name": "Jean-Luc Godard", "creator_id": 69995, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q53001", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977146, "name": "Andre Michelin", "creator_id": 36670, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977145, "name": "Pathe Films", "creator_id": 36669, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1977144, "name": "Athos Film", "creator_id": 30676, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52612", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1965", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1965"}], "labels": [34114], "external_references": []}, {"id": 94607, "acmi_id": "318564", "title": "Dead or alive 2: Birds [DVD] (D)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dead-or-alive-2-birds-dvd-d", "creator_credit": "Takashi Miike, Makoto Okada, Yoshihiro Masuda, Excellent Film, Toei Video and Daiei Motion Picture Company", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Japan, 2000", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>This film is an unusual sequel to &#8220;Dead or Alive&#8221;; unusual in that is has the same two lead actors but virtually nothing else in common with the original in terms of plot.

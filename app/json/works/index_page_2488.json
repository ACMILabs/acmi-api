The goal, as for the exhibition, was to stage a kind of confrontation between different ways of looking at history and its products. In addition to their works, which encompass a wide range of media, the CDs contain a large number of advertising images and photographs of the products in use, as well as excerpts from over 60 post-war documentaries that shed light on the industrial and social context that informed the design and reception of the objects. Quicktime objects and panoramas provide a close up of the items in collection.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 846696, "name": "Futurniture", "creator_id": 6739, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 846697, "name": "Torbjorn Lenskog", "creator_id": 6740, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 846699, "name": "Johanna Ekstrom", "creator_id": 6742, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 846701, "name": "Annika Eriksson", "creator_id": 6743, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 846698, "name": "Steven Bachelder", "creator_id": 73291, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846700, "name": "Annika Eriksson", "creator_id": 6743, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846702, "name": "Hadrian Pigott", "creator_id": 73292, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846703, "name": "Jane Simpson", "creator_id": 73293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846704, "name": "Johan Rosenquist", "creator_id": 73294, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846705, "name": "Niko Rohlcke", "creator_id": 73295, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846706, "name": "Magnus Carlson", "creator_id": 73296, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846707, "name": "Olle Carlsson", "creator_id": 73297, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846708, "name": "Fredrik Brattlov", "creator_id": 73298, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846709, "name": "Jacob Senneby", "creator_id": 73299, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846710, "name": "Anna Lenskog", "creator_id": 73300, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846711, "name": "Andreas Murray", "creator_id": 73301, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "designer", "role_id": 495, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 846712, "name": "Gaye Naismith", "creator_id": 73302, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "research manager", "role_id": 456, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Mixed; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "372", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 43, "name": "Sweden", "slug": "sweden"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [47639], "external_references": []}, {"id": 117608, "acmi_id": "509939", "title": "Retailing institutions and changing environments", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "retailing-institutions-and-changing-environments", "creator_credit": "", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1965", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1965-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Interviewee: Delbert J.

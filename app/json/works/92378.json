Klezmer musicians are born, not made, and this rich cultural tradition which originated in pre-World War II Poland and almost disappeared during the second World War because of the Holocaust and the Jewish migration out of Europe, has gone through a revival in America, particularly in New York. Leopold Kozlowski is one of the last remaining original klezmer musicians trained in the prewar tradition and through this documentary film, we journey with Leopold into his sometimes painful and tragic past to discover the inspiring and vibrant Jewish culture which he is so desperately trying to keep alive in Poland. Born in a small village near Lvov (Poland) called Przemyslany (now in the Ukraine) into a family of accomplished klezmorim - Leopold&#8217;s father was one of twelve brothers, all of whom were musicians - Leopold makes the return to his home and where his family were killed by the Gestapo. Here he visits his father&#8217;s grave, but also finds himself reunited with a friend he has not seen for fifty years. Leopold Kozlowski spent most of the war in concentration camps where his music became his inspiration for survival. This is a moving and delightful story, narrated by Yale Strom and featuring several pieces of klezmer music, performed by Leopold Kozlowski and others, including performers from the Polish State Theater and the Yiddish State theater. Includes some black and white footage, stills and archival film footage. In Polish, Yiddish, Russian and English with English subtitles.

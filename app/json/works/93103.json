Liam (Anthony Borrows), is a seven year old boy, whose parents, older sister and brother, live in conditions that could best be described as poor but happy. Liam&#8217;s father (Ian Hart) works on the Liverpool docks, a job he holds with great pride. Liam is a mostly silent child, pathologically shy with a terrible stutter. With his First Holy Communion looming, Liam faces his religious fears as he is constantly reminded of the fires of hell awaiting sinners. Meanwhile Teresa, Liam&#8217;s sister, has been employed by a wealthy Jewish family as a maid and faces a moral dilemma as she becomes embroiled in the extra-marital affairs of her boss. When Liam&#8217;s father loses work, his world is thrown into chaos, and looking for direction Dad is drawn to fascism. Con, Liam&#8217;s brother, threatens Dad&#8217;s role as breadwinner as he is employed and keeping the family afloat financially. Liam&#8217;s mother gallantly tries to hold the family unit together in the face of ensuing violence and division.

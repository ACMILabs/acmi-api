Humbert&#8217;s obsession for Lolita takes them both to some dark sexual and psychological places. Following his wife&#8217;s timely death Humbert seizes the opportunity to take Lolita on a cross-country journey - one that tracks the sexual progression of the relationship between step-father and daughter. Having majored in erotic cinema in the past (Nine and a half weeks, Fatal attraction, Indecent proposal, Unfaithful) Adrian Lyne is well placed to deliver the sexual fantasies of Humbert to the big screen. Jeremy Irons is a nervous and manipulative Humbert, suffering guilt for his sexual fantasies even as he exploits Lolita in order to realise them. Dominique Swain is well cast as Lolita - the young nubile nymphette, only faintly aware of the intensity of her sexual power over the hapless Humbert.

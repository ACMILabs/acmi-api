A culturally diverse group of seven high school students meets with members of the Odd Squad. The students talk to the police, then meet young people who are in recovery, and others still struggling with drug addiction. In the process, their views on drugs and the people who use them undergo important shifts. The students become more understanding and empathetic, and they reveal their own drug experiences.

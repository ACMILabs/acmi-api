Marie (Caroline Ducey), a young primary school teacher, is deeply disturbed by her narcissistic male model boyfriend&#8217;s behavior, who refuses to show her any kind of physical affection, much less make love to her. In an attempt to find a balance between the physical and emotional aspects of love, Marie embarks on a succession of brief encounters of the purely carnal kind with Paolo (played by Italian porn star Rocco Stiffredi), the ultimate latin lover, and Robert (Francois Berleand), an older man, who initiates her to S&amp;M games.

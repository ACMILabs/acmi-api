Then Chantelle, a no-nonsense nurse from Chicago, arrives. Chantelle couldn&#8217;t be more different than May-Alice and it seems she too will be given her marching orders. Then, unexpectedly, differences are put aside, secrets emerge, old friends drift into their lives and each finds an unlikely romance as they give themselves up to the forces of fate and friendship. Brilliant performances by the cast make this film a rewarding and worthwhile experience.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:15:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Physically handicapped", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/passion-fish", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 951800, "name": "Atchafalaya Films Inc", "creator_id": 25873, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951801, "name": "Sarah Green", "creator_id": 25874, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951802, "name": "Maggie Renzi", "creator_id": 23690, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 951803, "name": "John Sayles", "creator_id": 23691, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q2141212", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 951799, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39679", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [23240], "external_references": [{"id": 1263, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q431772"}, {"id": 5106, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "41768"}]}, {"id": 75996, "acmi_id": "013706", "title": "Passion (TEFC)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "passion-tefc", "creator_credit": "Ernst Lubitsch", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1919", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1919-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>The rise and fall of a shopgirl (Pola Negri in her screen debut) who became the mistress of Louis XV in her ruthless pursuit of wealth and influence, was a landmark in German cinema, and a runaway box office success internationally.

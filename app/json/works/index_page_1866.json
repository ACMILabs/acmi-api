To help Dostoyevsky achieve this deadline, Anna (Jodhi May), an impoverished student desperate for money to help support her parents, is hired as his stenographer. But Anna finds to her dismay that this writer is not an easy person to work with. He is belligerent, cantankerous and condescending with no respect or sensitivity towards Anna&#8217;s feelings. However as the days go by, Anna finds herself inextricably caught up with Dostoyvesky&#8217;s imagination and the story he is creating - a tale of a young couple at the Casino in the fictional German resort Roulettenburg where the young man&#8217;s gambling obsession has put him into debt. The intertwining of reality and fiction eventually leads to a strange erotic attraction between Dostoyevsky and Anna.

The film describes some of the planning and construction of the 500KV line - designed to carry power from the future generating stations of the Latrobe Valley to the local centre in Melbourne. Shows rolling out and cutting of the power cabling, installation of equipment at Hazelwood Plant, preparation and countdown for energizing in June, 1970. Photography by Jim Hayes. &#8220;Along the power lines&#8221; (1962): dramatised account of the work of the mobile repair units of the SEC. Shows film of the irrigation reservoir at Eildon and pipelines at Kiewa, power lines crossing the Murray River Valley joining New South Wales with Victoria and the various parts involved in the process of electricity production from brown coal. Footage of the power plants and lines shows inside the control centre near Melbourne, with the technicians at work monitoring the load on supply.

The Mohawk Indians from Kahnawake are famous for erecting the steel frames of skyscrapers and it is a tradition, which goes back generations. Some truly death-defining footage is shown of the steelworkers up on top of buildings skillfully shifting metal beams into position. The Indians community life is also shown in Kahnawake as well as some stunning historical photographs of Indians working on the Quebec Bridge in 1907 which ended in disaster. A song ballad by Bruce Mackay called Mountains of Iron and Steel is effectively mixed through the film.

Dangerous games: Excitement, money, greed, living on the edge, addictive, power and control are just some of the words used by the interviewees in this program. Gambling it seems has no limit to a person&#8217;s behaviour and just how far they are willing to go - some even to the point of death. Mark &#8220;Chopper&#8221; Read talks of his &#8220;rush&#8221; when he plays Russian Roulette, others get their excitement from betting on &#8220;dares&#8221; and playing weird games for money. There are so many ways to gamble - at the casinos, on the horses, playing the pokies and since gambling was legalised in Nevada in 1931, availability and those who are playing at the casinos has increased dramatically. This episode provides a historical background of gambling in America and the UK, focusing on the 1960s, the mafia involvement both in Las Vegas and London, and the change in attitude by society towards the &#8220;gambler&#8221;, particularly the &#8220;high rollers&#8221;. Features personal narratives and commentary from a wide array of gamblers, ex-gamblers, and those who work or are involved in the industry, including members of the Mob and associates of the Kray brothers. Fascinating up-front viewing, with tales of violence, murder, corruption, manipulation, fixing, winners, losers, and the whole &#8220;sexy&#8221; glam lifestyle associated with gambling. Contains archival footage including some b&amp;w scenes. Presented by John Inverdale.

It covers the establishment of the National Film Board in 1939; the war years; Canada&#8217;s first Oscar; and John Grierson&#8217;s sudden demise as Canada&#8217;s driving force in the industry. We witness the struggles of the private film producers, the development of the film industry in Quebec, and the emergence of the documentary. Above all, the film asks whether the alternating fortunes of the Canadian film industry, in the face of an overwhelming American presence, reflect the attitudes of the Canadian people towards themselves and their culture.

But how close to reality is this self-image of Argentinians? To answer this question, Jack Pizzey investigates the macho gaucho tradition, the tango, the influence of Italian and British immigrants, the personality cult of Juan and Evita Peron, the hideous torture and death squads of the 70&#8217;s and the debacle of the Falklands War.

In his novels, poetry, films and performance he has created an oppositional and profane aesthetic which continues to inspire contemporary artists and writers who refuse to - or cannot - work within the mainstream. This video features footage of Burroughs reading his poetry, excerpts from films by Gus van Sant, Antony Balch and Klaus Maeck, as well as a long interview where the writer explains his ideas on artistic inspiration; his belief that language is constituted as a virus; his use of &#8220;cut-up&#8221; and &#8220;fold- in&#8221; to represent contemporary experience of space and time; and the value of dreams for inspiration. Abrupt, unapologetic and disturbing this documentary reveals Burroughs as possessed of a profound intelligence, and as having the genius to translate his questioning and doubt into innovative and powerful art.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:55:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Literature&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "Literature&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Beat generation", "People&nbsp;→ Burroughs, William S., 1914-"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 779114, "name": "Maeck", "creator_id": 24732, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 779115, "name": "VAP", "creator_id": 24733, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 779116, "name": "Klaus Maeck", "creator_id": 77178, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 779113, "name": "Visionary Communications", "creator_id": 77085, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38380", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 18, "name": "Germany", "slug": "germany"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1986", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1986"}], "labels": [21976], "external_references": []}, {"id": 95311, "acmi_id": "319378", "title": "William Primrose: a violist's legacy", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "william-primrose-a-violists-legacy", "creator_credit": "KBYU-TV, Brigham Young University and Mark D Collier", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1979", "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1979-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>A biographical documentary on Scottish born classical musician, William Primrose, who first studied the violin but very soon changed to the viola and became one of the world&#8217;s leading viola players, renowned as a soloist and chamber musician.

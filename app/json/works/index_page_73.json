His heavily pregnant wife (Marisa Tomei) is facing urgent deadlines of her own. Henry&#8217;s boss, the managing editor (Glenn Close) is also reaching a crisis in her life and her senior (Robert Duvall) has just discovered he is an extremely sick man. To top it all, the paper is in pursuit of a hot story that could expose a major scandal and free two innocent boys charged with murder if they can beat the deadline. With the clock ticking, the tension mounts and somewhere amidst the chaos are moments that could change these people&#8217;s lives forever. Directed by Ron Howard and also starring Randy Quaid, this film is an inside look at the ruthless and sometimes savage newspaper business.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/the-paper", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 952808, "name": "Imagine Entertainment (US)", "creator_id": 26570, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952809, "name": "Brian Grazer", "creator_id": 67509, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952810, "name": "Frederick Zollo", "creator_id": 26572, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 952811, "name": "Ron Howard", "creator_id": 67518, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 952807, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40581", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [24113], "external_references": [{"id": 911, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1747211"}, {"id": 6131, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "12280"}]}, {"id": 95428, "acmi_id": "319566", "title": "The Pajama game", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-pajama-game", "creator_credit": "Warner Bros Pictures, George Abbott and Stanley Donen", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>A musical comedy about a pajama factory worker and her co-workers fight to get a 7.1/2 cents pay raise that is being fought by their employers.

The viewer moves in amongst and interacts with these images, their shadow visible over the image as they lean to look into each box. The figures within, dancers filmed from the Bangarra Dance Company, contort and rotate in the limits of the space, pulling inwards and pushing outwards, visually and spatially engaging in the historical and contemporary forces which construct and confine the Aboriginal body. In interaction with these images the use of a surround sound composite creates an aural journey that evokes pulsing electrical currents in a storage space, interrupted sporadically by the sound of tearing packing tape and a strong bass sound from below each box which creates a sensorial engagement with the movement in the images within.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Aboriginal Australia&nbsp;→ Aboriginal Australians", "Digital Art", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "Mixed media", "Performance"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["video, projections and cardboard"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1841169, "name": "Jonathan Jones", "creator_id": 81908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1841171, "name": "Warwick Thornton", "creator_id": 72838, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1841170, "name": "David Page", "creator_id": 81909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1841168, "name": "Jonathan Jones", "creator_id": 81908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "visual artist", "role_id": 493, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1841167, "name": "Darren Dale", "creator_id": 71501, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "film maker", "role_id": 459, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2721", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "'behind the mountains' is a commission for the ACMI and NGV exhibition 2004", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [53673], "external_references": []}]}

Large scale mechanised farms began to take over smaller farms, forcing small and tenant farmers who lost their land to migrate to the cities, where they swelled the ranks of the urban unemployed. This documentary is a look at &#8216;agri-business&#8217;, a term to describe the multi-national corporations that are attempting to create a world agricultural system in which everything they produce is for customers in the already wealthy countries.

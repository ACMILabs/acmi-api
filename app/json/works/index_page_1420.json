We see Sydney Harbour and images of the Whitsundays along the way. The highlight of this film is the footage of Bali in 1939. We see Balinese people in a traditional canoe, juking or cadik, paddle alongside the ship as it arrives in Bali. Once on land, there are images of temples, rice terraces, farmers, and a Balinese market with traders plying their trade. There are local people buying food from the stallholders and busying themselves around the market and socialising.

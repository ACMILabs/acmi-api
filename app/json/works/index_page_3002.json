Bejart created harmony between the traditional Japanese theatrical form and European ballet through the incorporation of Kabuki gestures, movement techniques and props in the ballet&#8217;s choreography.

Episode 1. Hunt or be hunted: Begins in prehistoric Africa 1.7 million years ago with Homo ergaster and fast-forwards a million years to Homo erectus through to the Cro-Magnons. Discusses the evolutionary process and the importance of adapting to climatic and environmental changes, of developing skills to master the art of survival and of how the discovery of fire-making played such an important role in the evolution story. Episode 2. Mastering the beasts: Follows the Cro-Magnons to America revealing their tenacity in surviving harsh elements, extreme hunger and the company of woolly mammoths. Also focuses on the Paleo-Indians of North America as two small bands come together for a ritual buffalo kill.

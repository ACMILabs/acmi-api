Ruan (Maggie Cheung) is already an established star at age 20 when her world starts to collapse. First married to an immature, pleasure seeking play boy, she obtains a costly divorce in order to set-up house with Tang Chi Shan (Tony Leung Ka-fai), a producer at Lienhua who is also a married man. Tired of playing melodramatic characters, Ruan accepts a role in film directed by an up and coming director titled &#8216;New Woman&#8217;. The film is a vicious attack of the Chinese press whose tabloid style is pushing a woman to destruction. The press retaliates so violently that massive cuts are ordered to appease the anger of the opinion makers. This is the time Ruan&#8217;s ex-husband re-appears and threatens to expose her as an adulteress. Ruan&#8217;s star starts to spiral down. The film blends fact and fiction, documentary and narrative. Rare footage of the real Ruan&#8217;s performances are mixed with Cheung&#8217;s re-creations of Ruan&#8217;s lost films.

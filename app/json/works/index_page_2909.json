Ruan (Maggie Cheung) is already an established star at age 20 when her world starts to collapse. First married to an immature, pleasure seeking play boy, she obtains a costly divorce in order to set-up house with Tang Chi Shan (Tony Leung Ka-fai), a producer at Lienhua who is also a married man. Tired of playing melodramatic characters, Ruan accepts a role in film directed by an up and coming director titled &#8216;New Woman&#8217;. The film is a vicious attack of the Chinese press whose tabloid style is pushing a woman to destruction. The press retaliates so violently that massive cuts are ordered to appease the anger of the opinion makers. This is the time Ruan&#8217;s ex-husband re-appears and threatens to expose her as an adulteress. Ruan&#8217;s star starts to spiral down. The film blends fact and fiction, documentary and narrative.

This work traces his life story from Kansas City to the New York jazz scene of the 1950s, tracing the short, somewhat tragic journey of a lauded and revered, if commercially ignored, musician. As well as providing key performances of signature tunes - Ballade, Yardbird Suite, Just friends, Koko, Confirmation, Au Privave and Kim Bloomdido - this work also comprises his only surviving TV performance, and interviews with Bird&#8217;s contemporaries. Contains wonderful vintage footage of Bird performing, plus tunes performed by Thelonious Monk, Louis Armstrong and Count Basie.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:59:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["Exempt"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Race discrimination", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ African American musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Bands (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Blues (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Improvisation (Music)", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz - History", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Jazz musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - 20th century", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - History and criticism", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Music - United States", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Musicians, American", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Composers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Parker, Charlie, 1920-1955", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Music - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2134085, "name": "Multiprises", "creator_id": 23416, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121223480", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134090, "name": "Pioneer Artists", "creator_id": 37287, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121144091", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134087, "name": "Sony Video Software Company", "creator_id": 37286, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121298901", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2134082, "name": "Toby Byron", "creator_id": 23415, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034900", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2134079, "name": "The AV Channel", "creator_id": 71973, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53174", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [34618]}, {"id": 93450, "acmi_id": "316892", "title": "Cecil B.

Filmed over a one-year period, Janis Lundman and Adrienne Mitchell formed quite a remarkable bond with the girls, allowing the filmmakers to present an up-close and intimate insight into each of their lives. Meet Lina, Russian born, migrated to Canada with her family when she was 5 years old, inwardly rebellious and striving to be thought of as an adult by her family - her main aim in life is to find a boyfriend; Erin is from a middle-class family, attends private school, and wants to be a model but struggles with problems of body-image; Helen of Korean-born parents who are devout Christians and hold strict family values, is an honors student caught between two cultures; Astra, a runaway teenager, is an enigma - perceptive and articulate who considers herself a problem child, hates living by the rules and enjoys living on the edge, hanging out with druggies and ex-crims; Rhonda, brash, black and ambitious skips classes but will do anything to achieve her ambition to be an actress.

The case being handled is a horse ring-in trial and the star witness, an 8 year-old boy. Steve Hennessey is still missing and Peter Faithful offers to do a deal with Kenny Hardy (being held for the armed bank robbery) in exchange for information leading to Steve&#8217;s whereabouts. &#8220;A Familiar utterance&#8221; (50 mins) (directed by Michael Carson). The irony of it all - Michael Kidd, the Hennessey&#8217;s barrister, is asked to defend two police (formerly of the Drug Squad) who have been charged with assaulting a bouncer in a night club. Rob Griffin, following a tip off from Prosecutor Clyde Martin, links up with Peter Faithful in tracking down a brief of a 10 year old unsolved murder of Patrick Clancy, best mate of Mal Hennessey. Contains some scenes in b&amp;w.

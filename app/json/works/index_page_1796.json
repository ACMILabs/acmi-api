But when her seemingly endless stream of promotions demand more and more of her time, Ding is confronted with a torrent of confusing feelings.

But she won&#8217;t budge. She has no time for him, and he supposedly needs to work hard to please her. He gets angry, they quarrel, and he leaves.<br />\nBy the time Miss Zhou has been made Bureau Head of the district&#8217;s post office, the once confident and cool Ding Dasen has degenertated into a whining sulky ball of frustration who preoccupies himself with formulating new schemes to make Zhou Qin jealous, or to find quick fixes to make himself more successful than her. As a result, he is easily taken in by the conman Cui Hailong, CEO of the &#8220;Space Exploitation Company&#8221; to launder money for him. When Cui is not conducting official business entertaining potential investors, he is boiling leather in the back room to sell as medicine.

Here we can also see how Ding&#8217;s upbringing according to these strict gender roles has left him totally incapable of taking care of himself. Mum meets butcher girl who is the complete opposite to Zhou. Ding&#8217;s mum wants to introduce the local butcher to Ding as a more practical alternative life partner. In a more traditional setup the two mums introduce the two and leave them to hit it off. Butcher girl Zhang immediately starts talking about money, as if discussing love could be substituted for a business negotiation. Ding is romantic and doesn&#8217;t appreciate the girl&#8217;s world view, who spends every waking hour scrambling for power and status.<br />\nDing&#8217;s older sister doesn&#8217;t like this new girl either, and seeks out Zhou at the post office. Zhou explains to her why she is always so busy; that she is vested with the heavy responsibilities of mediating not only working practice, but also worker relations: Health, marriage, deaths and quarrels all fall under her jurisdiction. Eventually all is resolved, and both Ding and Zhou are able to compromise to live happily together.<br />\nCultural History of the Film:<br />\nThe film provides a variety of approaches to the issues relating to shifting gender roles in a rapidly changing society full of opportunity. Amidst all this change, it is also acknowledged that there are many who seek to exploit these changing interpretations and evolving markets.

Cui is shown to be a man who no longer follows even the most basic moral principles.<br />\nWith the economic and philosophical reforms of the Chinese system, many people such as Cui, who most likely suffered in their youth during periods of want and famine, were not educated or cared for, and as a result lack the common moral foundation of their peers.

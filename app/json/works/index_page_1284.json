Each piece is shot with different personas, and filmed in the first and final take&#8217;.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:23:58:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["unclassified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Digital Art", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;â†’ Short films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Single channel moving image, colour and audio"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1038978, "name": "Phyllis Baldino", "creator_id": 6282, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 13356, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser002.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "still #1 from The Unknown Series", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13357, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalunkser003.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "still #2 from The Unknown Series", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 640, "height": 480, "access_level": "View anywhere"}, {"id": 13358, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif.1200x1200_q85.gif", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif.480x480_q85.gif", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif.960x960_q85.gif", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif.1920x1920_q85.gif", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/baldino.gif.3840x3840_q85.gif", "caption": "still #3 from The Unknown Series", "credit_line": "", "alt_text": "", "width": 140, "height": 110, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "67", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994-1996", "notes": "", "to_year": "1994-1996"}], "labels": [47397]}, {"id": 107903, "acmi_id": "66", "title": "Nano-cadabra", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "nano-cadabra", "creator_credit": "Phyllis Baldino", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1998", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/phybalnancad001.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "record_type": "work", "type": "Digital art", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "Single channel moving image, colour and audio", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1998-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Baldino takes the theory of &#8216;Nano-technology&#8217; as her jumping-off point to explore the connections between science, magic and wonder.

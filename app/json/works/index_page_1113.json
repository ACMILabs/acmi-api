After many years in prison a dying woman&#8217;s confession finally clears Lee of the murder. Although supposedly based on fact it seems likely that the silent film versions were based on a play performed in Australia in 1912. The success of the first film version (now lost) made in the same year led the distributors Haldane and Sherry to produce a new version in 1921 expanding the story to include scenes from Lee&#8217;s happy childhood. Piety and intensity of emotion are emphasised and the film is at times crudely sentimental. Despite negative reviews the remake was again very successful with the public.

This work centres in part on the personal relationship between Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas - two women, who with their circle of literary friends, revelled in the artistic life of the city and the expanding opportunities for women. Several bookshops owned by women became a part of the rich cultural life of Paris, in particular Shakespeare and Co., run by Sylvia Beach. Beach pioneered modernist writing and championed a literary career for struggling artists such as Hemmingway and James Joyce. Contemporaries of the period discuss the milieu of the times in fascinating interviews, intercut with archival footage, home movies and stills.

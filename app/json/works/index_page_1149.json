This non-profit volunteer based association aims to preserve Victoria&#8217;s steam powered rail heritage and keep examples of them running for public tours to many destinations on Victoria&#8217;s Rail Network. In addition to preserving the days of steam-powered trains, the group also has sections that are dedicated to preserving Diesel and Electric rolling stock as well. During the interview, we see examples of the work undertaken on the carriages and associated equipment.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:13:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["ACMI classified"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ Railroad trains", "Documentary", "History&nbsp;→ Australia - History", "Places&nbsp;→ Melbourne (Vic.)", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1425899, "name": "Northern Access TV", "creator_id": 8909, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1425898, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1425897, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1425895, "name": "Michael Costello", "creator_id": 8907, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1425896, "name": "David McLauchlan", "creator_id": 8908, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2307", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1998", "notes": "", "to_year": "1998"}], "labels": [48454]}, {"id": 114125, "acmi_id": "B1005483", "title": "Kimberley country", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "kimberley-country", "creator_credit": "Lucinda Gamble", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2000", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2000-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Kimberley country music has its own unique style and is promoted each year through the Derby Country Music Festival where musicians from as far as Halls Creek, Fitzroy Crossing, Port Hedland and the desert area of the Kimberleys gather together and compete in the Festival Talent Quest.

The resurrection of the genre came when the Hammer Studios in England revamped the story of Dracula in colour with a new leading man, Christopher Lee, in Terence Fisher&#8217;s Horror of Dracula (1958). This effectively spawned a barrage of films with vampire content, some of which actively sought to cash in on the popularity of the blaxploitation and kung-fu genres, resulting in films such as Blacula (1972) and Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires (1974). The leading men who portrayed Dracula on-screen, most notably, Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, are also discussed in detail.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion pictures - Excerpts", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Documentary", "Feature films", "Horror", "Horror&nbsp;→ Vampire films", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Magic, Occult & Supernatural&nbsp;→ Vampires", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 805817, "name": "Ted Newsome", "creator_id": 26802, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "47781", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 179, "name": "Unknown", "slug": "unknown"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1990", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1990"}], "labels": [30027], "external_references": []}, {"id": 90993, "acmi_id": "314058", "title": "Dracula", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "dracula", "creator_credit": "Universal Studios, Carl Laemmle Jnr and Tod Browning", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1931", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1931-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Possibly the most enduring vampire film of all, Tod Browning&#8217;s Dracula (1931) owes much to the performance of its male lead, Bela Lugosi, and the expressionistic cinematography of Karl Freund, who had previously worked with F.W.

Originally released in 1976, the album entered the U.S Billboard album charts at number one and held the position for 14 weeks. Success also heralded Motown Records&#8217; reinvestment in Wonder, resigning him to the label in a lucrative deal. The album was successful in the United Kingdom, reaching number two, remaining in the charts for over a year, and was a worldwide best seller. This outstanding success in 1976 culminated in the announcement that Stevie Wonder was the recipient of Album of the Year at the Grammys, as well as being named Producer of the Year and Best Male Vocal Performer.

At press conferences throughout his career Ali proved that he often cut an amusing, charismatic and inspirational figure.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:28:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Armed Forces, Military, War & Weapons&nbsp;→ Vietnam War, 1961-1975 - Protest movements", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Athletes", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxers - Biography", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Boxing", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Foreman, George", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Sports - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Ali, Muhammad, 1942-", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Boxers - Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Foreman, George"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [], "creators_other": [{"id": 2084755, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51642", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2002", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2002"}], "labels": [33359]}]}

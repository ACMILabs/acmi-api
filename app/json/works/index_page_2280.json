Danny&#8217;s choice is not between abstract notions of good and evil, but between choosing loyalty and community or justice and isolation. Lumet&#8217;s long-standing experience in filming in New York City results in a film in which the inner-city itself - decaying, dark and violent - becomes a character in the film. &#8220;Prince of the city&#8221;, though based on real life events, is one of Lumet&#8217;s most personally felt films and the care and commitment is evident from all the technical aspects to the casting of bit parts: at times it approaches documentary realism. The film won the prize as best film at the Venice Film Festival in 1981.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:47:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Biographical", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police corruption", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "People&nbsp;→ Biographical films", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1815726, "name": "Burtt Harris", "creator_id": 80429, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883328, "name": "Orion Pictures Corporation", "creator_id": 9553, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 883330, "name": "Sidney Lumet", "creator_id": 72312, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q51559", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51345", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1981", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1981"}], "labels": [33200], "external_references": []}, {"id": 71819, "acmi_id": "008689", "title": "Prince of palms", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "prince-of-palms", "creator_credit": "Malayan Film Unit and A Peter Amavasi", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Malaysia, 1956", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1956-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>An account of Malaya&#8217;s third largest industry.

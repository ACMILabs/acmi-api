The Taliban, with their extreme Islamic fundamentalism, turned Kabul back to the dark ages with their strict laws, public executions, ethnic cleansing and making women into non-existent beings by ordering them to stay at home or cover themselves in the burqua denying them access to schools or any form of education.

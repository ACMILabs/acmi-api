Broadhurst was brutally murdered on 15 October 1977 at her Paddington premises; and the killer has never been identified. Broadhurst was renowned for her flamboyant clothes, antique jewellery and coiffed, hennaed hair. &#8220;Unfolding Florence&#8221; explores her life in a vibrant and unconventional style, with more than a touch of humour and irreverence; a fitting approach to this unusual woman&#8217;s story. Cast includes Judi Farr (as Florence) and Felicity Price (as the young Florence).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Designers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Interior design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Textile design", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interior design", "People&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1865203, "name": "Nicholas Beauman", "creator_id": 81377, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865202, "name": "Katherine Thomson", "creator_id": 81376, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3194044", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865201, "name": "Gillian Armstrong", "creator_id": 214, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865200, "name": "Charles Hannah", "creator_id": 81375, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865199, "name": "Sue Clothier", "creator_id": 30348, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865198, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865197, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865196, "name": "Becker Entertainment", "creator_id": 81374, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1865195, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1865207, "name": "Felicity Price", "creator_id": 81381, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865206, "name": "Judi Farr", "creator_id": 81380, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865205, "name": "Paul Grabowsky", "creator_id": 81379, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865204, "name": "John Radel", "creator_id": 81378, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 1865194, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53730", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [35090], "external_references": [{"id": 2098, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q7884372"}]}, {"id": 94855, "acmi_id": "318884", "title": "Japanese Story", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "japanese-story", "creator_credit": "Jill Bilcock, Alison Tilson, Sue Brooks, Sue Maslin, Film Victoria, ScreenWest, Showtime Australia, Film Finance Corporation Australia and Gecko Films", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2003", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2003-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Australian geologist Sandy (Toni Collette) lands the unwanted task of showing a Japanese businessman Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima) around the mines and deserts of the Pilbara, hoping to sell his company the geology software she has been co-developing.

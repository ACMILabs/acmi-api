Jabez Gadsden in 1879. The company pioneered tinplate printing in Australia, and produced the first printed can the country had seen. By 1936 the company had twelve factories spread throughout Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n<p>The company’s success allowed two generations of Gadsden family men – Stanley Gadsden and his son Ronald – to pursue their interest in amateur filmmaking (a relatively expensive hobby for the time). The two cameramen captured the family’s children, homes, many of its major events and holidays on film.</p>\n<p>A collection of the films made by these Gadsden family photographers has been donated to ACMI by Chris Gadsden (Ronald’s son). The films comprise a fascinating assortment of imagery that provides a window into bygone days and customs.</p>\n<p>This film is a wonderful composite of several different sequences in different periods of time, including the 1934 floods in Melbourne, tennis and gardens in the 1930s, beach scenes in the 1950s and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.</p>\n<p>This film was originally made using 16mm film.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 very dramatic flooding around Melbourne, which is likely to be 1934 when major flooding from torrential rains affected large areas of the city.<br />\n00:00:02:00 people looking out over a flooded road and possibly submerged bridge toward urban buildings on the the hillsides on the other side of the floodwaters. We may assume a trip to town has been stopped by the floods as the group are dressed for an outing.

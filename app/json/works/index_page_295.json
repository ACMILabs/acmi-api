The attacker escapes making the writer the key witness and potentially, the next victim. Loosely based on a novel by Brian Edgar Wallace, Argento&#8217;s first feature helped established the Italian filmmakers reputation as the master of the Gaillo genre (Giallo meaning yellow, the colour of the cheap and lurid horror/thriller paperback novels sold in Italy). &#8216;The bird with the crystal plumage&#8217;s&#8216; stylish and violent set pieces (enhanced by Vitorrio Storaro&#8217;s fluid cinematography and Ennio Morricone&#8217;s unnerving score) had Argento dubbed in his home country as the Italian Hitchcock. The comparisons don&#8217;t end there however, as both directors also share a taste for sly black humour which Argento displays through the array of oddball characters that populate the film, including a demented artist who eats cats and a pimp with a neurotic streak. Cast also includes Suzy Kendall, Enrico Maria Salerno, Eva Renzi, Reggie Nalder and Mario Adorf.

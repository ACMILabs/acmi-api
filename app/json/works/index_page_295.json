She lives with her mother in a trailer in the middle of an anonymous European city; in previous generations she would have been a member of a working class community which would have at least tempered some of the alienation and hardship associated with poverty. But in the globalised free market at the end of the century, Rosetta has to fend for herself and her survival depends much more on selfishness than it does on comradeship: the competition of the market effects every minutiae of her life. This shattering film is uncompromising in its depiction of the &#8220;new&#8221; urban poor, refusing to allow sentimentality or romance to compromise the ambiguities and complexities of its central character. Infused with a sparse aesthetic - natural sound, no musical soundtrack, handheld camera - the film dispassionately follows Rosetta as she attempts to find any avenue she can to get a job, to make a pittance, to survive. The young actress Emilie Dequenne had not acted for the camera before, and her startlingly effective performance won her the Palme d&#8217;Or at Cannes. By eschewing safe choices, by reaffirming the political and aesthetic commitments of realist and humanist filmmaking, and by presenting the culture of the underclass in economic terms not as a &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; (as Hollywood is prone to do), the Dardenne brothers have made the pivotal film about contemporary class relations. Winner of the Palme d&#8217;Or in 1999, &#8220;Rosetta&#8221; created such a controversy that the Belgium government was forced to change industrial relations legislation that penalised young workers (such as Rosetta). That fact alone speaks volumes about the integrity and power of this film. In French with English subtitles.

At first disconsolate, the boy is cheered up by African-American handyman Uncle Remus (James Baskett), who tells him many delightful fables concerning the clever trickster Br&#8217;er Rabbit, whose adventures are illustrated in cartoon form. Based on the popular &#8216;Uncle Remus&#8217; stories of Joel Chandler Harris and blending live action with cell animation, &#8216;Song of the South&#8217; is an American classic, both loved for its popular songs and seamless technique, and reviled for its condescending depiction of African-Americans. Also starring Hattie MacDaniel.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:34:17:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Animation", "Animation&nbsp;→ Animated films - United States", "Childrens Films", "Childrens Films&nbsp;→ Children's films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ African Americans in motion pictures", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Children's literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Storytelling"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1993629, "name": "Harve Foster", "creator_id": 79110, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993628, "name": "Wilfred Jackson", "creator_id": 72154, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993627, "name": "Walt Disney", "creator_id": 68785, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993626, "name": "Perce Pearce", "creator_id": 76400, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1993625, "name": "Walt Disney Pictures", "creator_id": 66972, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1993630, "name": "Gregg Toland", "creator_id": 75679, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "cinematographer", "role_id": 32, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "46397", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1946", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1946"}], "labels": [28840], "external_references": [{"id": 23934, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1345920"}]}, {"id": 89347, "acmi_id": "312077", "title": "Lucie Aubrac [Widescreen]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "lucie-aubrac-widescreen", "creator_credit": "Claude Berri, Pierre Grunstein and Renn Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1997", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1997-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>Loosely based on Lucie Aubrac&#8217;s account of her time in the French Resistance - &#8216;Outwitting the Gestapo&#8217;, Claude Berri&#8217;s film is an attempt at recreating the style of classic war films, in which a love story unfolds against a backdrop of action and danger.

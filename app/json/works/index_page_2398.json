Delightful, light-hearted romantic comedy based on the characters created by Aurania Rouverol. Cast also includes Sara Haden, Lina Romay and Dorothy Ford.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:33:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - United States", "Comedy", "Comedy&nbsp;→ Romantic comedy", "Drama", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Relationships", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 965691, "name": "Willis Goldbeck", "creator_id": 34706, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965690, "name": "Robert Sisk", "creator_id": 81303, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 965689, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 965688, "name": "Arts Centre Melbourne", "creator_id": 79926, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 20608, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/hdnXmbdUngE5N7wKidLm8sgGiqX.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Love laughs at Andy Hardy (Willis Goldbeck) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1000, "height": 1500, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53389", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1946", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1946"}], "labels": [34830]}]}

It is a re-adaptation from a novel of the same name published in1981, in which the Director and screenwriter try to expose the life of peasant farmers during a time of transition from the old, Communistic China, to a &#8216;new&#8217; China which breaks from the discreet eye of the Communist government.  The film reflects the hardships, demeaning experiences and environments of peasantry farmers, as well as general society views at the time.

After graduating from High school, the young male protagonist Gao Jialin had the hopes of working as a teacher in a primary school in the city.  However, his dream was shattered when the opportunity was directly given to the son of a cadre.  Gao was forced to return to the countryside to earn a living with his parents as lowly peasant farmers and this abrupt fall down the social ladder plagued him every day.  He was constantly in denial about his peasantry life until an illiterate, country girl Liu Qiaozhen attempts to open his eyes to see the beauty of the country folks and their country life.

However, although Gao finds that little positive changes have occurred, he still couldn&#8217;t abandon the thought of working in the city because his interest is still deeply rooted in writing literature. When Gao&#8217;s uncle changes his job and becomes the Regional Labour Secretary, without much thought, Gao grasps at the opportunity to break away from his lowly country life.  Subsequently, Gao&#8217;s old classmate and secret admirer Huang Yaping tries to help Gao secure a job as a journalist in the city.</p>\n<p>Liu was in depths of despair when Gao left for the city to work but they promised each other that they will remain faithful to one another.  However, Gao is tempted by the glitter and gold of living in the city and ultimately breaks up with Liu—choosing to develop his career over love.  Liu was left heartbroken and was soon married off to a man who had a crush on her from another village.</p>\n<p>Gao learns about Liu&#8217;s fate but was convinced by Huang, who despite already having a boyfriend, that he can have a brighter future in her company because she is educated and is brought up in a family of higher social class. As Gao starts to think that his dream is within reach; believing that he can lead a new and better life away from the country, Life tells him otherwise.  His life plummets immediately when the mother of Huang&#8217;s ex-boyfriend reports him to high authorities about the improper procedures Gao used to obtain his job position in the city.

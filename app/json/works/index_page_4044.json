Every street is an expressway and underpasses eliminate the use of intersections. It is a capital city where government buildings dominate, so this allows a unity in futurist architecture throughout, which looks like a giant set for a science fiction film. Important footage of the city is shown during its development stages. Lucio Costa won the competition for Brasilia&#8217;s master plan and Oscar Niemeyer designed the major government building. America&#8217;s first planned city of Philadelphia is also profiled along with the controversial plans of redevelopment, which will see the city into the future. Plans made by architects and designers of futurist cities are also shown towards the end of the program. This program was presented on the Tomorrow series by CBS News.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:57:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Cities and towns", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Philadelphia (Pa.)", "Communications, Infrastructure, & Transport&nbsp;→ City planning", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Architecture", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Community development, Urban", "History&nbsp;→ Historic buildings", "History&nbsp;→ History", "Places&nbsp;→ Philadelphia (Pa.)", "Television", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs", "Television&nbsp;→ Television programs&nbsp;→ Television programs - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 848546, "name": "CBS Television", "creator_id": 13114, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121315085", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "20989", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1960", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1960"}], "labels": [4888]}, {"id": 65392, "acmi_id": "320170", "title": "Big Ben", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "big-ben", "creator_credit": "British Movietone News and Central Office of Information", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1959", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1959-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>The centenary of Big Ben and the history behind the famous chime.

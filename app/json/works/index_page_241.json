"brief_description": "<p>William (Billy) Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>In this film, filmmaker Billy travels by ship to Fiji, then Honolulu, Hawaii and on to Canada. The film gives an indication of what it was like to travel by ship around the Pacific in the 1960s. Featured in the film is the passenger ship &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; which was built in Scotland for P&amp;O Cruises (original name, &#8216;The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company&#8217;) in 1953, for trips between Britain and Australia. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s &#8216;Arcadia&#8217; became a cruise liner on the trans-Pacific routes including the West Coast of America.

"brief_description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia’. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film is about a trip around North Queensland to locations such as Townsville and National Parks. Wallace films the wonderful brolga water birds of the title but also captures the dramatic Wallaman Falls in Girringun Park, which is Australia&#8217;s highest permanent single drop waterfall, and the Little Crystal Creek Bridge on Mount Spec Rd in Paluma Range National Park. The bridge and Mt Spec Road are of particular interest as both are listed heritage sites on the Queensland Heritage Register and were constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s using mostly unskilled labour and with the application of &#8216;Unemployment Relief Scheme&#8217; funds. Mt Spec Road remains substantially intact throughout the 18km of its length and demonstrates an extensive and now uncommon use of concrete arch culverts, dry stone walling and stone-paved gutters.

"<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s. As well as Australian urban settings and some world travels, Wallace’s films focus on the many hiking and camping destinations that he visited.</p>\n<p>Often carrying the credit, ‘A Walkabout Film’, Wallace’s movies indicate that he was part of a nature study and walking group called ‘The Walkabouters Club of Victoria Inc’. The ‘Walkabouters’ formed in 1968 as a result of a Council of Adult Education (CAE), Outback Study Tour to Central Australia. Some of the attendees decided to start the Club in order to continue educative walks particularly around Victoria. The Club encouraged their resident artists and photographers to capture their activities.</p>\n<p>The collection of Wallace’s films was donated to ACMI by his widow Gwenda Clarke and is shot on various formats, predominantly Standard 8mm and Super 8mm film.</p>\n<p>This film captures a &#8216;Walkabouters&#8217; trip to the Werribee National Park in Victoria. As well as the landscape, wildflowers and insects that Wallace always likes to film, there are scenes of the campsite, pitching tents and preparing food on open fires as well as gas campstoves. A visit to Blackwood Pottery is also included where Wallace shows the mesmerising process of pottery being made by hand at a pottery wheel.</p>\n<p>Originally made on Super 8mm film. The film has a soundtrack of music and Wallace&#8217;s narration but the quality is not good. The sound drops out early in the film for several seconds and is a little hard to understand at times.</p>\n<p>Selected highlights list:<br />\n00:00:02:00 titles &#8216;The Walkabouters&#8217;, &#8216;Werribee Gorge Nov 1972&#8217;<br />\n00:01:13:00 putting up camping tents<br />\n00:01:37:00 taking a break at a picnic table near a campfire, possibly drinking wine from wine flagons<br />\n00:01;53:00 cooking sausages on a barbeque iron plate over the open flames, sitting in 1970s style folding chairs<br />\n00:02:02:00 an old utility style truck with participants packed in the back as other participants set off walking<br />\n00:02:38:00 assisting each other as hikers are traversing a rocky creek and bending under the barbed wire of a farm fence while others hold wire up<br />\n00:03:51:00 using cameras and binoculars while listening to a guide or club member talking about the Gorge, followed by precarious crossing over water by using an old fallen tree<br />\n00:04:50:00 views around the landscape<br />\n00:06:05:00 hikers rest among the trees<br />\n00:08:10:00 views around the landscape and from a higher vantage point down to the river and tents<br />\n00:09:16:00 getting rock samples<br />\n00:09:50:00 views of the Werribee River and the rocky steep banks<br />\n00:10:15:00 views along the river, rocky outcrops and trickling waterfalls<br />\n00:11:09:00 preparing a meal back at base camp<br />\n00:12:12:00 eggs and bacon cooking on the open fire and a view of the tents<br />\n00:12:49:00 clambering over a farm gate<br />\n00:12:58:00 horses and cows<br />\n00:14:12:00 a colourful bug on a leaf<br />\n00:15:12:00 soaking tired feet in the creek<br />\n00:18:40:00 sign for &#8216;Blackwood Pottery&#8217; followed by the pottery studio<br />\n00:19:15:00 views around the studio and potters at their wheels<br />\n00:20:15:00 the pottery kiln<br />\n00:21:31:00 an old cement camp fireplace barbeque with billies boiling and meat cooking<br />\n00:21:49:00 serving the billy tea at a park picnic table<br />\n00:22:08:00 eating the barbequed chops in bread, sleeping under a tree and photographing the scenery<br />\n00:23:53:00 close-ups of wildflowers<br />\n00:25:17:00 outdoor eating back at the tents<br />\n00:25:26:00 canoeing down the river<br />\n00:26:09:00 title &#8216;The End&#8217;</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>[Wallace Clarke Home Movies: Reel 28]</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wallace Clarke</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>Australia, 1972</p>", "description": "<p>Wallace Clarke was an amateur filmmaker who was particularly keen on capturing the Australian landscape from the 1960s to the 1990s.

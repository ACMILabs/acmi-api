We used to get dressed in the Spargo hotel. Had to wade across through the creek, which you can see down the bottom there, get our feet nice and wet. If you were up there playing fullback or full-forward, and the ball was down this end, you could not see which side had the ball.</p>\n<p>There was a big hump in the middle of the ground, and the only way you could fathom it out was which direction the ball was travelling. And on one wing, we used to have to wade through ferns to get the ball.</p>\n<p>There was rabbits all around the area at those times, and it was often when we were crossing the creek, there&#8217;d be rabbits running around everywhere. [LAUGHS] And well, as you can see, the ground has not changed.</p>\n<p>[SHEEP BLEATING]</p>\n<p>There were a lot of grounds that were in pretty ordinary condition in those days.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>I remember on the Chewton football ground in the Castlemaine league, that electric light was running through the ground about the center half forward position. And often the ball would hit that, and if you were standing on the wire, you were surprised when you found yourself you had the ball.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>DON DUUS: I don&#8217;t know whether the Chewton fullback knew he could hit the lines, but he hit them very, very regular. And of course, the opposing teams wouldn&#8217;t have a clue what was going on. And of course, if the umpire told us that we could play on if the power lines were hit, we used to play on and kick goals, much to the annoyance of the opposing team.</p>\n<p>[MEN SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>The Harcourt was pretty bad. It had a big creek running down one side of it. And many a player&#8217;s disappeared down the creek. Kyneton was a little bit difficult.

But the biggest trouble there was the snow. We played on Woodend, I think it was, at one stage on about 6 inches of snow.</p>\n<p>And I remember one of the players, real tough, hard player, come out.

I&#8217;ve been involved in the three premierships that we have won and involved again at the moment. Balranald&#8217;s a town of 1,400 people. Virtually impossible to keep the young people here.

I have contributed large sums of money. But we&#8217;ve certainly done our homework. We&#8217;ve gone around metro Melbourne and Mildura and hand-picked the players that we reckoned wood do the job.</p>\n<p>[PLAYERS SHOUTING]</p>\n<p>MERV NEAGLE:  I think after the &#8216;94 Premiership, this club won 14 games in 10 years. You know, I mean, and you get sick of it. You don&#8217;t want to go along and the players get sick of it. The all the supporters get sick of it.</p>\n<p>So when all of a sudden, they decided, OK let&#8217;s have another crack at it, it&#8217;s just like a breath of fresh air, isn&#8217;t it? OK, we&#8217;ve got a good side. We&#8217;re going to win. Let&#8217;s go to the footy.</p>\n<p>And the whole town on a Saturday when the team plays away&#8212; like we went to Tooleybuc on Saturday. You could have fired a gun up the Main Street of this town and you wouldn&#8217;t have hit anyone. There&#8217;s just a different hype around the place when your football side&#8217;s winning.

We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick. Couple of my teammates were rushing in, saying, if you kick this, we can still win.</p>\n<p>And right here&#8212; you know, the people were rushing onto the ground now. At this stage, everyone&#8217;s everywhere. It&#8217;s just&#8212; you sort of had to break through people to get to where you were going.</p>\n<p>And the umpire&#8217;s going up to the 50-meter line. And of course, they&#8217;re all celebrating. So there&#8217;s only&#8212; I think there might have been one player or two players out of their side realized what was going on.</p>\n<p>And he&#8217;d made it to the goal line, basically. And there was no one on the mark, because no one was interested in what was going on. [CHUCKLES] So right through here&#8212; I never stopped once. I got to here.

And from then on, it was just full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>[MOTOR RUNNING]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: I see our biggest challenge as being fundraising, because we have a pretty clear idea of what we are going to get from a go at the Canteen and the bar. And that&#8217;s enough to cover our expenses. But it&#8217;s not enough to do anything with new buildings. It&#8217;s not enough to repair our fairly basic amenities. We can&#8217;t send players on trips and things like that. We cannot afford to pay our player&#8217;s memberships. We have to ask them to pay, that sort of thing. I&#8217;ve really got to watch all the costs.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>DERRY MONAGHAN: They certainly all pick [INAUDIBLE] stumps. And not for a while they haven&#8217;t, but we did that at [INAUDIBLE] just to try and get a couple of extra players each year. And the local boys here cut wood to source money for the football trip.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>The main source of income is the Vic Grain Bunkers. We have the contract to empty them the [INAUDIBLE] Bunkers. And when we get enough trucks, we can make a lot of money. And that&#8217;s how we source the money to run the club. Now it&#8217;s one in, all in, and from me, down to the players.</p>\n<p>[CHATTER]</p>\n<p>KATE COMMINS: Really, the things that keep small country towns going are your pub, your football team, and your primary school. Well, all of those things are kind of in part of our football club. And I think that most people are prepared to come and be part of it, put in that extra bit, do those few extra jobs. Or we might well lose it.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>MAN: Everyone on our committee are very successful businessmen in the town in their own right. And they all got kids playing. And that&#8217;s where this all stems from. And I think nearly every country footy club would be the same.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:03:05:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

An’ they’re renowned for carrying things in their mouth and that’s their biggest ambition to carry things around, and ah, she started to go to the football with Arthur and she decided she’d become a working member too, and um, she used to… because we lived quite close to the football ground she knew when there was football on and she was always very excited until he made a move and um, she would carry the flags over too the ground an’ when the captains and what-have-you went out to the centre to throw the coin up she would go, as soon as the coin had been thrown and the winning Captain pointed she would just automatically pick up the flags and race down to that end.</p>\n<p>She got tripped over a few times but she would generally just sit in front of the car and just wait and wait and wait and then at half time she would head off and they’d both go and have a drink some where and she’d repeat the project and just carry the flags back to the other end that’s about there was to it, but she was very keen on that little job. But she became, like, quite an icon, everyone knew her. She died and so that was the end of her.</p>\n<p>She is buried in the football ground, or under a pine tree in the football ground, not in the middle of the ground, but she is buried under a pine tree. You don’t really see much of dogs doing the right thing at the football, they’re usually knocking off pies or doing something else or chasing footballers, annoying them. She didn’t do that sort of stuff, she was quite a lady.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:02:41:00"]}, {"label": "Subject categories",

Rivalry comes to the forefront for both players and communities.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Rob Rodini, Shane Robertson, Luke Adams. Television news excerpt reproduced with kind permission of WIN TV, Ballarat.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>It’s all right; the time has finally arrived for Hepburn and Daylesford to go head to head. With both sides once again back in the same footy league, locals can’t wait for the big clash.</p>\n<p>Oh well, they don’t have a lot going for them down there in Hepburn. They’re always a poor man’s version of Daylesford but we should be right….Come on there&#8230;</p>\n<p>Been around the Club, I suppose, from when I was…I don’t know…from when they could carry me to the ground. I’ve been connected with Hepburn ever since, and I don’t know, the rivalry was there before my time, it was always…I think every town that is close has the rivalry in the footy sides. When they put the sewage line down through Hepburn, well there were people in Daylesford said “Oh great, we been waiting years to shit on Hepburn”. Well I suppose if you want to call that rivalry.</p>\n<p>I think it’s always been there. Even when I was at Daylesford I must admit that I poached some Hepburn players, Hepburn Football Club’s poached Daylesford players. That tends to set a bit of rivalry off the field in a sense that while there having a beer together they’re actually sledging each other, an it’s got to a stage where the rivalry’s rebuilt but in a stronger situation because of ,uh, playing in the same league and the closeness of the towns.</p>\n<p>The only thing that probably eats at me a little bit about Hepburn is I don’t think they give our footy club enough respect, you know.

Football League Grand Final is commemorated with a peculiar and truly unique trophy.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Chris Brown.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>CHRIS BROWN:  Given that we&#8217;re the Mallee Football League, the perfect thing to make any trophies out of would have to be the Mallee stump. The local postmaster, who was a woodturner in his spare time, decided to commemorate the 1975 Grand Final with a trophy that was truly unique.</p>\n<p>He got a good Mallee stump, and he had to try and find one that was well-dried and wouldn&#8217;t crack too much as it dried out. It took him a heck of a long time to turn it. And then he made the lines down for the seams in the football, put the laces on, and then had a little plaque of every player, trainers, coaches, president secretary, and the whole lot, just to commemorate what happened in 1975.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>1975 was just an amazing year. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you go. And I went coaching and won a number of other premierships, but your first is always something special. And with your own mates and with your own club, especially to go from a club that was pretty well down and took a lot of beatings, to be able to get up and win a premiership was just always the best feeling. It always has been. And yeah, always will be.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>Because we didn&#8217;t have any social club rooms at the time to store any of our memorabilia, everything was stored at the pub. And as different publicans come and go, some don&#8217;t like the memorabilia that apparently collects dust, and so he decided he&#8217;d clean the place out. And I went past one day and he was heading out to the tip with all of this football memorabilia in the back of his Ute.</p>\n<p>And so I quickly went in and grabbed the lot.

So I think I&#8217;d written my first footy report in 1947, so I&#8212; I had to count back, but I think that might be 60 years come next year.</p>\n<p>It never becomes boring because my wife and I go to a different game every week. Shirley gets out of the car in the freezing cold to take action shots of footballers, and I sit in the warmth, taking notes. And up to date, she hasn&#8217;t complained too much. So we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>\n<p>What we try to do is to cover it based on word and pictures and not to leave anybody out, if we can possibly help it. All the details, right down to the best players in the under-13 netballs and whatever.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>SHANE O&#8217;SHEA:  Robin needed a bit of a hand, so he said, do you want to cover a game? I started off in the reserves, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he had me in the seniors. It&#8217;s the closest I&#8217;ve ever got to senior football, I must admit. But it&#8217;s sort of grown from there. I&#8217;m at a game each Saturday, taking photos and just doing a report on that game.</p>\n<p>[TYPING]</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re recording the history of the leagues and associations as it happens. And it&#8217;s vital that we keep presenting that and recording that and covering their achievements and promoting the sports as long as we can.</p>\n<p>ROBIN LETTS: We&#8217;ve found that, particularly at times like this, when we&#8217;ve had practically a 10-year drought and things have been so tough, that football and its allied sports are so important that they would be the only activity in our lives that, particularly at finals times, has the ability to virtually lift up the population of one town and shift it to another, and then bring it home again. And there&#8217;s nothing else in our lives quite like that.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s the conversation, going up the street every week.

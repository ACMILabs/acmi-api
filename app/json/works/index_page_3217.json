His video installations - total environments that envelop the viewer in image and sound - employ state-of-the-art technologies and are distinguished by their precision and direct simplicity.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:28:04:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Festivals - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - Australia", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Art, Modern - 21st century", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Artists - United States", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Multimedia (Art)", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Religious films", "Experimental", "Experimental&nbsp;→ Experimental films - United States", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 840862, "name": "ACMI", "creator_id": 6272, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 840866, "name": "David Meagher", "creator_id": 10916, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840865, "name": "David Meagher", "creator_id": 10916, "role": "sound", "role_id": 952, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840864, "name": "Jason White", "creator_id": 73899, "role": "camera operator", "role_id": 931, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 840863, "name": "Kim Montgomery", "creator_id": 8660, "role": "executive producer", "role_id": 916, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVCAM; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVCAM; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "154957", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "06 OCT 2010", "notes": "", "to_year": "06 OCT 2010"}], "labels": [56551]}, {"id": 117058, "acmi_id": "B2002169", "title": "Fire Woman and Tristan's Ascension: Bill Viola installation and interviews", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "fire-woman-and-tristans-ascension-bill-viola-installation-and-interviews", "creator_credit": "ACMI", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 04 OCT 2010", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": null, "brief_description": "<p>This film captures the installation of the large projection screen and associated audio visual equipment needed to showcase Bill Viola’s works, &#8216;Fire Woman&#8217; &amp; &#8216;Tristan’s Ascension&#8217;.

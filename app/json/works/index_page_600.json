Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a cause of much celebration - and an occasion for much pageantry - in Victoria. Elizabeth was the first reigning monarch to visit Australia, and the young and popular royal couple attracted intense interest wherever they visited on their extensive Australian tour.</p>\n<p>This silent, pre-release footage - much of which eventually comprised sections of the official Victorian film release - follows the visiting couple on their journey throughout the state; including numerous regional centres as well as major sites and events in Melbourne. It shows not only the &#8220;official&#8221; portrait of this historic royal visit, but also dwells on the reactions of the Victorian people; crowds of whom waited by roadsides and railways, on city streets and in small country towns, for a glimpse of the monarch.</p>\n<p>As well as focusing on the history of the 1954 royal visit, the footage thus also gives us a unique and invaluable look back in time at some of the buildings, streetscapes, vehicles, cameras, fashions and crowd behaviours of the mid-1950s in Victoria.</p>\n<p>Reel 1 of this extraordinary collection corresponds to the first 11 minutes of the official State Film Centre release (see ACMI Collection Title [315392]) &#8220;The Visit to Victoria of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh&#8221;. It shows some of the preparations for the visit, the arrival by plane of the royal couple at Essendon Airport and their first progress through Melbourne to State Parliament and Government House. We see the Queen opening State Parliament, visiting the MCG to meet with Australian armed servicemen and women, attending a special race meeting at Flemington Racecourse and a Davis Cup game at Kooyong Tennis Centre. The Queen and Duke also go to St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, and the reel closes with the official dedication of the forecourt and eternal flame at Melbourne&#8217;s Shrine of Remembrance.</p>\n<p>Detailed Description Reel 1:</p>\n<p>Opens with Titles:<br />\n1) &#8220;The State Film Centre Presents&#8221;<br />\n2) &#8220;The Visit to Victoria of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh&#8221;<br />\n3) &#8220;Filmed with the co-operation of State Government Departments, Cine Service Pty.

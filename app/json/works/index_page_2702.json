The film was then hailed as one of Gremillon&#8217;s finest work.</p>\n<p>Credits: Producer, Raoul Ploquin, Albert Valentin ; director, Jean Gremillon ; writers, Marcel Achard, Charles Spaak ; photography, Werner Krien ; music, Roland Manuel.<br />\nCast: Raimu, Madeleine Renaud, Pierre Blanchar, Marcelle Geniat, Andrex, Viviane Romance, Marcel Maupi.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:40:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["French"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1804958, "name": "Albert Valentin", "creator_id": 83137, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1804957, "name": "Raoul Ploquin", "creator_id": 28527, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q241242", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 890736, "name": "Jean Gremillon", "creator_id": 74414, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1685560", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "16mm film; Limited Access Print (Section 2)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "146810", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1938", "notes": "", "to_year": "1938"}], "labels": [55579], "external_references": [{"id": 1572, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q3205531"}]}, {"id": 116268, "acmi_id": "X000472", "title": "L'etoile du Nord = the North Star", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "letoile-du-nord-the-north-star", "creator_credit": "WDR La Sept Cinema and Pierre Granier-Deferre", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1982", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1982-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "brief_description": "<p>After years of aimlessly wandering around Northern Africa, Edouard Binet is sailing back to Europe.

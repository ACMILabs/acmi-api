Broadhurst was brutally murdered on 15 October 1977 at her Paddington premises; and the killer has never been identified. Broadhurst was renowned for her flamboyant clothes, antique jewellery and coiffed, hennaed hair. &#8220;Unfolding Florence&#8221; explores her life in a vibrant and unconventional style, with more than a touch of humour and irreverence; a fitting approach to this unusual woman&#8217;s story. Cast includes Judi Farr (as Florence) and Felicity Price (as the young Florence).</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classifications", "display_values": ["Mediatheque - all ages (ACMI classified)", "PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Designers", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Interior design", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Textile design", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Australia", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Interior design", "People&nbsp;→ Broadhurst, Florence, 1899-1977"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White and Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2476119, "name": "Gillian Armstrong", "creator_id": 214, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q438911", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476121, "name": "Nicholas Beauman", "creator_id": 87191, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476118, "name": "Charles Hannah", "creator_id": 81375, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121034559", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476117, "name": "Sue Clothier", "creator_id": 30348, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476114, "name": "Becker Entertainment", "creator_id": 81374, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4878657", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476113, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476115, "name": "New South Wales Film and Television Office", "creator_id": 7906, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476116, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2476120, "name": "Katherine Thomson", "creator_id": 81376, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q3194044", "role": "writer", "role_id": 939, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2476125, "name": "Felicity Price", "creator_id": 81381, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q66459215", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2476124, "name": "Judi Farr", "creator_id": 81380, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q6302810", "role": "cast", "role_id": 33, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2476122, "name": "John Radel", "creator_id": 81378, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director of photography", "role_id": 925, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2476112, "name": "Film Australia", "creator_id": 68514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 2476123, "name": "Paul Grabowsky", "creator_id": 81379, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1379286", "role": "music", "role_id": 949, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "53730", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2006", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "2006"}], "labels": [35090]}, {"id": 88137, "acmi_id": "310592", "title": "Gods and monsters", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "gods-and-monsters", "creator_credit": "Bill Condon, Gregg Fienberg, Mark R.

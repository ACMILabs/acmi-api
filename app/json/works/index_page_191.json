Fearless Leader plans to buy up as much cable television time as possible for their program RBTV (really bad television) and feed mindless drivel to the masses, turn them into zombies, and provide malleable intellects to support his plans for being president. FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) brings the moose and the squirrel back into the real world and takes a road trip with her cartoon heroes in pursuit of Fearless Leader. An impressive blend of animation and live action, the cast also includes Randy Quaid and features cameos by John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. Pitched at both adults and children, there are sight gags and corny puns as well as plenty of irony for those that can notice.

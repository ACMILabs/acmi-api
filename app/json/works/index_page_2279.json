Liam (Martin Compston) wants a new life for his mother when she gets out of prison and foils plans by her boyfriend to smuggle drugs inside during a visit with he and his grandfather. After a severe beating by the boyfriend and being kicked out of home by his grandfather, Liam takes refuge at his sister Chantelle&#8217;s house (Annmarie Fulton). Liam and his best mate Pinball (William Ruane) try and raise some cash to buy a caravan for his mother on her release but the boys get involved with drug trafficking and gangsters, resulting in a series of events that are also their undoing.

Doyle&#8217;s collision of nature and culture invest everyday occurrences and familiar spaces with an otherworldly aura.</p>\n<p>Doyle filmed across the United States in New York, Florida and Nevada, but The Light ultimately describes a non-place.  Journeying from the countryside to urban construction grounds and the illumination of New York, light becomes a powerful metaphor for humanity&#8217;s struggle, through technology and determination,<br />\n to &#8216;pierce the night and see through the darkness&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Beginning with the most simple of structures, a glowing street lamp, The Light gracefully charts a procession of increasingly complex illuminations.  The film slowly builds toward the memorial light columns of the World Trade Center, which are shown not in direct conjunction with 9/11 but as the formal and abstracted transcendence of pure light.</p>\n<p>(SW 30.03.05)</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:10:18:00"]}, {"label": "Subject category", "display_values": ["Digital Art"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Audio Format/Stereo"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2637454, "name": "Brian Doyle", "creator_id": 10701, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [NTSC]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [NTSC]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Mini DV; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "11710", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2003", "notes": "", "to_year": "2003"}], "labels": [49232]}, {"id": 109737, "acmi_id": "B2000072", "title": "Albe's Alphabet", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "albes-alphabet", "creator_credit": "Lauren Barker", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2004", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2004-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A fun educational piece for children delivering the alphabet in various forms of 2 D animation.

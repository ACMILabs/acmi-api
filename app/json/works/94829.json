This beautifully photographed film is a penetrating study of the lunacy of war and the decay of the aristocratic class in Europe. The first feature by Ridley Scott, its ravishing imagery recalls the classicism of pictorial art of the period: the characters are framed in backgrounds that suggest Constable and Watteau. As the two men&#8217;s bitter feud enters its second decade, the images owe much to Turner and Delacroix. The rigid codes of pre-Napoleanic France are swept away by the romantic tide of revolution.

The latter, chanted to a mesmerizing musical score by Tibor Szemzo, form a haunting aural counterpoint to the richly textured images of this intimate and eloquent documentary.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Hungary"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1765621, "name": "Peter Forgacs", "creator_id": 6357, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MOV file ProRes4444; Digital Preservation Master - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "MPEG-4 Digital File; ACMI Digital Access Copy - overscan", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "695", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 25, "name": "Hungary", "slug": "hungary"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1996", "notes": "", "to_year": "1996"}], "labels": [47825], "external_references": []}, {"id": 67808, "acmi_id": "320665", "title": "Free fall", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "free-fall", "creator_credit": "ONF | NFB, Tom Daly, Colin Low and Arthur Lipsett", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Canada, 1964", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1964-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>Made of film trimmings assembled by Arthur Lipsett, this experimental film conveys a flow of intense psychological impressions representing a new form of filmed perception.

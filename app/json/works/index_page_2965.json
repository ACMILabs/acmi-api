Later on the conventions of the genre were cleverly re-invented for a nineties audience by director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson in Scream, which pays direct homage to Halloween. John Carpenter opens his film with an unnerving point of view shot of the young psychotic Michael Myers brutally stabbing his teenage sister to death on Halloween night. Flash forward to Halloween 15 years later and Michael has escaped the mental institution he has been locked up in. Meanwhile shy, virginal teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her girlfriends are preparing for Halloween, unaware of the menace that lurks in their quiet suburban community.

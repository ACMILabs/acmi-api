Woody Allen plays Isaac Davis, a comedy writer whose wife (Meryl Streep) has left him for another woman. Isaac is intending to write a book about his romantic entanglements but his work is constantly interrupted by the demands of two ex-wives, his guilt over his relationship with a precocious 17 year old schoolgirl (Mariel Hemingway) and his affair with his best-friend&#8217;s mistress (Diane Keaton). Managing to be biting and romantic, elegant and satirically funny, &#8220;Manhattan&#8221; defined the social mores of the educated urban bourgeoisie at the tail end of the &#8220;Me Generation&#8221;. Filmed in luscious black and white by Gordon Willis and featuring some of George Gershwin&#8217;s finest music, &#8220;Manhattan&#8221; is a celebration of the vitality and sheer magic of the city of New York. Though this bittersweet fable may poke fun at the pretentiousness and self-righteousness of New Yorkers, Allen&#8217;s teasing of people&#8217;s foibles never reverts to mere caricature. This version features the film&#8217;s original theatrical trailer.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:32:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Adultery", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Literature&nbsp;→ Writing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Gershwin, Ira, 1896-", "People&nbsp;→ Gershwin, Ira, 1896-", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Black and White"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 959249, "name": "Woody Allen", "creator_id": 46827, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 959248, "name": "Charles H.

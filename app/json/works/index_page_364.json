Henry Mancini&#8217;s theme tune and the cartooned figure of the Pink Panther himself add acclaim to this hilarious film.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:53:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Comedy", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1811988, "name": "Martin Jurow", "creator_id": 25161, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788233, "name": "Mirisch Corporation", "creator_id": 22759, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788234, "name": "Blake Edwards Productions", "creator_id": 25160, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 788236, "name": "Blake Edwards", "creator_id": 77081, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q56093", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 788232, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41054", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1963", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1963"}], "labels": [24565]}, {"id": 85074, "acmi_id": "306440", "title": "Paint your wagon", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "paint-your-wagon", "creator_credit": "Joshua Logan, Alan Jay Lerner and Paramount Pictures", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1971", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1971-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood star in this famous film version of the the stage musical.

John Waters style is firmly stamped on this film as he recreates a nostalgia for an era.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:25:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ United States - Social life and customs", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Musicals"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/cry-baby", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2148969, "name": "John Waters", "creator_id": 85738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2148968, "name": "Rachel Talalay", "creator_id": 55447, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q508224", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2148966, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2148962, "name": "Imagine Entertainment (US)", "creator_id": 26570, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2148959, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "41049", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [24560]}]}

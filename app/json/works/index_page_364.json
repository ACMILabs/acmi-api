A geographic presentation gives us not only a tapestry of the best fishing areas, but also a beautifully cinematic vision of the magnificent Southern Coastline. The Murray Valley, Coorong, Eyre and York Peninsulas, and the Spencer and Flinders Gulfs are explored, and sophisticated graphics give both an insight into the best season to fish and the species to be caught in those areas. A summary of the tourist facilities and other attractions is also presented, which makes this program the ideal guide to the coastal and freshwater recreational areas of South Australia.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:45:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Travel", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Educational & Instructional", "Educational & Instructional&nbsp;→ Educational films", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Fishing", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia", "Travelogue"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2411271, "name": "Robert Browne", "creator_id": 22441, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2411270, "name": "Keylite Productions", "creator_id": 22440, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "37007", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1989", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1989"}], "labels": [20649]}, {"id": 76291, "acmi_id": "323472", "title": "I was there", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "i-was-there", "creator_credit": "Kristian Ryhammer, Teamfilm AS and Central Film O", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Norway, 1970", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1970-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>A survey of the modern integrated transport system in Norway - a rail ticket entitles you to travel by train, boat or bus and you may break your journey when and where you like.

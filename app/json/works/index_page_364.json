The collection was donated to ACMI by Michaelis&#8217;s daughter, Sally Cohen, and her husband Sheldon Cohen. The films show life in Melbourne including the 1956 Olympic Games, a fishing trip to Bermagui in NSW, and holidays in Indonesia.</p>\n<p>This is a home movie from the Michaelis family of early Melbourne. &#8216;Australian Scenes&#8217; is the title on screen and starts with a lovely view from the Yarra looking back to the city skyline. The river bank is packed as an exciting rowing regatta takes place. A great shot facing south from the top of Swanston Street and then the Shrine of Remembrance. We see a passing parade of Australian Army personnel in their slouch hats. A crowd on the steps of the Old Treasury Building. &#8216;Flemington, Cup Day, 1940&#8217; is next with crowds of men in hats and wide shots of the running of the race and winners circle. A tennis match is played in front of a sold-out crowd in the &#8216;1946 Davis Cup Challenge&#8217; at Kooyong&#8217;s tennis courts. A very scenic &#8216;Picnic at Warrandyte&#8217; reflects a relaxing day out with the family in the country. There is footage of Australian native animals at what is possibly Healesville Sanctuary.  &#8216;Bayside Scenes&#8217; shows families enjoying the cooling waters of Port Phillip Bay. &#8216;Autumn at Macedon&#8217; is a brief scene of trees in autumn colours.

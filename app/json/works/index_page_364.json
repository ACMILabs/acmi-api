Forester&#8217;s Napoleonic era naval hero, Captain Horatio Hornblower is made larger than life by an excellent performance from Gregory Peck. This is an epic film with plenty of broadside action and cannon fire as Hornblower&#8217;s man-o-war takes on the French and Caribbean pirateers. Hornblower&#8217;s sterness is eventually softened by true love in the guise of Lady Barbara Wellesley (Wellington&#8217;s sister), played by Virginia Mayo.

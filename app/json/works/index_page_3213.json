The resulting film focuses our attention on both the small intimacies and larger tragedies of the family which are implied but not directly expressed in the original sequences. A couple dancing is slowed down to the point of intense romantic reverie; a woman ages before our eyes, leaving the family via divorce, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p>The men of the family, Zoltan, his father and two brothers are captured in freeze-frame portraits, as we learn of their various fates during and after the second world war. Oversize portraits of Lenin and Stalin are carried through the streets; a fascinating dialogue between private and public history.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:00:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English", "Hungarian"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Amateur & Student Films", "Amateur & Student Films&nbsp;→ Amateur films", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family", "Foreign language films"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 728808, "name": "Peter Forgacs", "creator_id": 6357, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 728810, "name": "Tibor Szemzö", "creator_id": 73087, "role": "composer", "role_id": 538, "is_primary": false}, {"id": 728809, "name": "Marta Revesz", "creator_id": 73086, "role": "editor", "role_id": 918, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "images": [], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "Digital Betacam [PAL]; Sub-master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "VHS [PAL]; Reference - timecoded", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "694", "production_places": [{"id": 25, "name": "Hungary", "slug": "hungary"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1988", "notes": "", "to_year": "1988"}], "labels": [47824]}, {"id": 67424, "acmi_id": "003590", "title": "Father and daughter", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "father-and-daughter", "creator_credit": "Lucy Liu Brown, Corinne Hart, Karl Holtsnider, Franciscan Communications and Teleketics", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1975", "thumbnail": null, "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1975-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>When Dr. Cortum, a devout Catholic and a medical doctor, discovered that his 18 year old daughter Michelle was experimenting with drugs he asked her to leave home rather than give a bad example to their younger children.

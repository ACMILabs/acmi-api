Harvey Keitel stars as the out of control police lieutenant, turning in a mesmerizing performance that can only be described as feral. Co-written by Ferrara with Zoe Lund (who starred in Ferrara&#8217;s 1981 perverse revenge film &#8220;Ms. 45&#8221; and who also makes a brief appearance in &#8220;Bad lieutenant&#8221;), the film explores familiar terrain for the director, mainly debasement and redemption. Ferrara, not one to shy away from the darker aspects of human nature, follows his law enforcing protagonist as he gambles, steals, takes drugs and in one of the most uncomfortable scenes, sexually coerces two teenage girls. When a young nun is brutally raped on the alter of a local church, the &#8216;bad&#8217; Lieutenant is called into the investigation. The horrific circumstances of the crime forces the corrupt Lieutenant to examine his own life, sending him into a spiral of despair and ultimately a chance at personal salvation. Cast includes: Paul Calderone, Victor Argo, Frankie Thorn, Paul Hipp, Victoria Bastel, Robin Burrows.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:30:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Police films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Police corruption", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Rape", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Gambling"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 963114, "name": "Abel Ferrara", "creator_id": 29983, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963113, "name": "Edward Pressman", "creator_id": 23171, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963112, "name": "Mary Kane", "creator_id": 31359, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 963111, "name": "Bad Lt Productions", "creator_id": 35769, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51578", "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1992", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1992"}], "labels": [33336]}, {"id": 111120, "acmi_id": "B2001093", "title": "Bad Habits", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "bad-habits", "creator_credit": "Rozlyn Clayton-Vincent, Justin Davies, Jason Ramp and AFTRS", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2006", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "2006-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Bill has to make a compromise when forced to choose between his wife and his best mate.

Governor of G Ward is Helen Stewart (Simone Lahbib), a boss with a conscience unafraid of standing up for the rights of the prisoners. The core group of women comprise of: Shell (Debra Stephenson), a lifer and the toughest woman on the ward, Denny (Alicia Eyo), Shell&#8217;s faithful sidekick and occasional lover, Nikki (Mandana Jones) a thinking lesbian who isn&#8217;t afraid to speak her mind and has unresolved sexual tension with the Governor, and the Julies, 2 women called Julie fond of finishing one another&#8217;s sentences. An engrossing mix of violence inflicted by women towards women and the inadequacies of the prison system, it also attempts to capture the vagary of relationships and emotions experienced by women who share confined quarters and are without civil liberties. Devised by Maureen Chadwick, Eileen Gallagher and Ann McManus, this award winning series is now in its 5th season. Season two saw the arrival of Karen Betts (Claire King) and Barbara Hunt (Isabelle Amyes), and more high profile stories for Yvonne Atkins, Crystal and Zandra.

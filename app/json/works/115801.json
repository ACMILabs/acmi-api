Huang Tianba is a kung fu master and a sworn brother of three forest outlaws. The newly-appointed governor of Yangzhou caught Huang&#8217;s big brother and executed him. Huang plotted an assassination of the local governor after he failed to rescue his big brother. A girl went to assassinate the local governor with her father on the same night as Huang, and mistakenly took Huang as the governor&#8217;s body guard. By the time they knew the identity of each other, the two were surrounded by a large troop. Huang helped the girl escape but was caught by the troop.

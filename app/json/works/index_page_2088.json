In order to win the hand of a beautiful woman, Sayo, he must impress her father, a teacher in jujitsu. The finest master of jujitsu, the implacable Higaki, also seeks the hand of Sayo and vows to kill Sanshiro in a midnight fight on a windswept mountainside. Made during World War II, &#8216;Judo Saga&#8217; lacked the propagandist angle found in many Japanese films of that era, and the film was heavily censored with 1,856 feet of film removed.

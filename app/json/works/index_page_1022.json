And really, it looks like it&#8217;s a cycle of about every 10 years that someone decides, well, it&#8217;s time that we had another go, so. I&#8217;ve been involved in the three premierships that we have won and involved again at the moment. Balranald&#8217;s a town of 1,400 people. Virtually impossible to keep the young people here.

The &#8220;Swampies&#8221; recognise their football club as the heart of their community.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Alan Thorpe, Laurie Edwards, Des Edwards, and Lindenow South Football Club.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>I was fifteen when I started playing for Lindenow South an’ have played with both teams…played for Lindenow, played with Lindenow South an’ it seemed a shame that the people in the towns dislike each other so much, as far as the Football goes. But it stems back to years and years ago, Lindenow were the rich an’ the mighty sort of thing an’ they decided they wanted to amalgamate with our Club an’ we didn’t want to an’ they’ve been tryin’ now for about twenty odd years, tryin’ to get us together but never the twain should meet, sort of thing.</p>\n<p>They’ve tried everything…they tried there a few years back they put a dummy President and Sec’etary in an’ took our coach an’ several of our players. But there’s one thing they couldn’t take an’ never will take from the “Swampies” an’ that’s the Swamp Hawks spirit. They’ll never get it.</p>\n<p>I don’t know whether there’s really that much rivalry, I guess we perhaps don’t like ‘em much. It’s been just the way it is, like…even my grandma, she used to follow the footy, she actually died at the footy, like she took a bit of heart attack, she was barracking for her grandson playing and she was real keen, very keen. We had some good supporters over the years and especially some of the ladies with their bloody umbrellas, their pointy umbrellas…good weapons.</p>\n<p>It’s the hub of the town.

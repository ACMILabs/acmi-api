Clair chose to use sound only when needed, preferring to tell the story through his visuals as much as through his dialogue. The result is a striking film, boasting beautiful photography and sets, as well as a moving story. The art direction by Lazare Meerson fixed an iconography of Paris - a sweet version of the darker &#8216;Poetic Realism&#8217;, full of street singers, irate concierges and neighbours, and pretty &#8216;midinettes&#8217;. This iconography is often re-used in the form of a nostalgic homage in recent efforts such as &#8216;Delicatessen&#8217;. Reference: Ginette Vincendeau. The Companion to French cinema.

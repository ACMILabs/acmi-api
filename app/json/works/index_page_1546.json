Despite their eccentricities, Morris refrains from judging or mocking each character and instead is even-handed and respectful. As they discuss their obsession, each reflects on philosophical matters that range from evolution, the Other, survival to life and death. Morris reveals how these obsessions reflect not only their personalities and values but also elemental emotions and thoughts: fear and survival for the lion tamer; nature and its human manipulation for the topiary; the Other and the act of confronting something completely foreign for the mole-rat specialist; and the interface between machine and man, technology and life for the robot scientist. Morris interweaves early cinema footage with present-day material in a dreamlike, musical manner that emphasises the connections between each individual&#8217;s obsessions. Ultimately, what these individuals obsessions come to represent is less an eccentricity or weirdness and much more an act of attempting to come to a genuine understanding of the world, society and human life.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:22:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Rats", "Animals & Wildlife&nbsp;→ Wild animals", "Climate, Environment, Natural Resources & Disasters&nbsp;→ Gardening", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Portraits", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - United States", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Individuality", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Obsessive-compulsive neurosis", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Garden structures", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Robots", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science", "Mathematics, Science & Technology&nbsp;→ Science - Experiments", "People&nbsp;→ Portraits"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/fast-cheap-and-out-of-control", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1997673, "name": "Errol Morris", "creator_id": 4115, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q977546", "role": "producer/director", "role_id": 31, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1997672, "name": "Fourth Floor Pictures", "creator_id": 35129, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50964", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1997", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1997"}], "labels": [32911], "external_references": []}, {"id": 93402, "acmi_id": "316830", "title": "Way down east [DVD]", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "way-down-east-dvd", "creator_credit": "D.W.

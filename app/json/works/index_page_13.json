The sailors would pay local Yolngu people in return for permission to harvest the trepang and a culture of interchange and trade was born between these two communities.</p>\n<p>In 1994, Darwin artist Andrish Saint-Clare began working with the Yolngu people from Elcho Island and with Macassan performers from Sulawesi to embark on a memory-retrieval process which could lead to the staging of stories of this important period in history. The final work, &#8216;Trepang&#8217;, evolved into a cross-cultural, indigenous opera that was performed on Elcho Island and Sulawesi and then again for a wider audience in Darwin.</p>\n<p>At the Australian centre for the Moving Image, the video artwork Trepang has its genesis both in this early period of cultural contact and collision, and in these recent theatrical performances.</p>\n<p>In consultation with Saint-Clare, ACMI has created a small screen-and-mirror assemblage in which a storm of images - echoes of knowledge, trouble and memory - and reflections all buffet together as if the past is rumbling in from just over the horizon.

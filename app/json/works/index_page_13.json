In 1985, it was voted number 1 in Sinclair User’s ‘Top 50 Spectrum Software Classics’.</p>\n<p>To create the game Beam’s director Alfred Milgrom advertised on the bulletin board at Melbourne University hiring students Veronika Megler and Philip Mitchell. Originally tasked with making the “best adventure game ever’.  Milgrom secured a licence to use J.R.R Tolkien’s popular book the <i>The Hobbit</i> by using Melbourne House’s book publishing relationships, and promising that a copy of the book was to be included with the game. The inclusion of the book with the game was also valuable to the player, as knowledge of the story was needed to solve the challenges that  Megler had designed.</p>\n<p><i>The Hobbit</i> was remarkable for both its sophisticated parser and creation of a world that appeared open – were time passed, objects had physics and characters autonomy.</p>\n<p>The games interface, Philip Mitchell’s parser Inglish allowed for full sentences with adjectives, where previously most adventure games only allowed for simpler verb-noun combinations. The program was complex enough to intuitively understand pronouns, adverbs, punctuation and prepositions. This allowed players to interact with the games in a way never before possible. Commands could be strung together not just to control the actions of the player character but with the inclusion of “SAY” directive could be issued to non player characters .</p>\n<p>In designing the game world Megler wanted to create a place that felt more alive. Objects in the game are given a size and weight ratio which affects your ability to interact with them. You could place one object inside or on top of another. If your character was sitting on an object and that object was thrown, then your character would go with it. Another point of difference with this game and any previous text-based adventure game was that events happened in real time. If you walked away from the computer things would happen with out you. As you played each non-player character and monster had a turn when you did,  meaning that many unforeseen events could occur, Elrond might kill the Warg making your journey less  troublesome. Gandalf might get himself killed making that game more challenging. The set of characters actions were  in part randomised but also affected by the actions of the player so attacking them was not a good idea. As was learnt by many players who  became impatient with Thorin and his constant singing. At this time the expression “Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.” entered the popular culture of gamers.</p>\n<p>Players found <i>The Hobbit</i> constantly appealing because non-player characters existed independently. They were able to roam freely through the game-world and would not necessarily do the same thing twice. This and the games text driven physics enabled the game to be repeated and played in different ways. Due to the openness of its world, “The Hobbit” was an early game to support ‘emergent gameplay’.</p>\n<p><i>The Hobbit</i> was a challenging game to play requiring trail and error  to progress and solve puzzles. Letters requesting assistance were sent to popular magazines who devoted columns to advising players. One player David Elkan wrote an entire guide to playing the game which he sent to Melbourne House who published it as book ” A guide to playing <i>The Hobbit</i> (1984).</p>\n<p>References: ACMI Alfred Milgrom interview, 28 April 2006: Interview text provided by Alfred Milgrom 1st March 2013. , Maher, J, “The Hobbit”, The Digital Antiquarian, http://www.filfre.net/2012/11/the-hobbit/; Newman J, Simons, I (2007) 100 Videogames, BFI Screen Guides, BFI Publishing, London</p>\n<p>This version of <i>The Hobbit</i> is for the BBC Model B.

Originally tasked with making the “best adventure game ever’.  Milgrom secured a licence to use J.R.R Tolkien’s popular book the <i>The Hobbit</i> by using Melbourne House’s book publishing relationships, and promising that a copy of the book was to be included with the game. The inclusion of the book with the game was also valuable to the player, as knowledge of the story was needed to solve the challenges that  Megler had designed.</p>\n<p><i>The Hobbit</i> was remarkable for both its sophisticated parser and creation of a world that appeared open – were time passed, objects had physics and characters autonomy.</p>\n<p>The games interface, Philip Mitchell’s parser Inglish allowed for full sentences with adjectives, where previously most adventure games only allowed for simpler verb-noun combinations. The program was complex enough to intuitively understand pronouns, adverbs, punctuation and prepositions. This allowed players to interact with the games in a way never before possible. Commands could be strung together not just to control the actions of the player character but with the inclusion of “SAY” directive could be issued to non player characters .</p>\n<p>In designing the game world Megler wanted to create a place that felt more alive. Objects in the game are given a size and weight ratio which affects your ability to interact with them. You could place one object inside or on top of another. If your character was sitting on an object and that object was thrown, then your character would go with it. Another point of difference with this game and any previous text-based adventure game was that events happened in real time. If you walked away from the computer things would happen with out you. As you played each non-player character and monster had a turn when you did,  meaning that many unforeseen events could occur, Elrond might kill the Warg making your journey less  troublesome. Gandalf might get himself killed making that game more challenging. The set of characters actions were  in part randomised but also affected by the actions of the player so attacking them was not a good idea. As was learnt by many players who  became impatient with Thorin and his constant singing. At this time the expression “Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold.” entered the popular culture of gamers.</p>\n<p>Players found <i>The Hobbit</i> constantly appealing because non-player characters existed independently. They were able to roam freely through the game-world and would not necessarily do the same thing twice. This and the games text driven physics enabled the game to be repeated and played in different ways. Due to the openness of its world, “The Hobbit” was an early game to support ‘emergent gameplay’.</p>\n<p><i>The Hobbit</i> was a challenging game to play requiring trail and error  to progress and solve puzzles. Letters requesting assistance were sent to popular magazines who devoted columns to advising players. One player David Elkan wrote an entire guide to playing the game which he sent to Melbourne House who published it as book ” A guide to playing <i>The Hobbit</i> (1984).</p>\n<p>References: ACMI Alfred Milgrom interview, 28 April 2006: Interview text provided by Alfred Milgrom 1st March 2013. , Maher, J, “The Hobbit”, The Digital Antiquarian, http://www.filfre.net/2012/11/the-hobbit/; Newman J, Simons, I (2007) 100 Videogames, BFI Screen Guides, BFI Publishing, London</p>\n<p>This version of <i>The Hobbit</i> is for the BBC Model B.

And in the famous &#8216;54 Grand Final, I was the center half forward. The next year, we made the Grand Final and lost to Greta after 43 minutes elapsed in the last quarter. That sounds unbelievable, but it&#8217;s a fact.</p>\n<p>[CLOCK TICKING]</p>\n<p>KEVIN MAYHEW:  At three-quarter time, we held a fairly comfortable lead. However, something happened in the timekeeper&#8217;s box. And something that even to this day, we&#8217;re not too sure, whether it was a Bermuda triangle or a vortex that come over the timekeeper&#8217;s box at Tarrawingee, we can&#8217;t say.</p>\n<p>But as the game unfolded in the final quarter, Chiltern maintained their lead. And as legend would have it, at the end of full time, the Swans were actually in front on the scoreboard. The siren didn&#8217;t sound at the end of full time. It actually went into overtime. And at the end of time on, Chiltern were still in front on the scoreboard.</p>\n<p>[CLOCK TICKING]</p>\n<p>DON STEPHENSON: My immediate oponent, Ernie Ford, said to me around that time, he said, well, you&#8217;ve done us to a bloody frazzle Don, so good on you. And we just kept going, and I laughed, and I said, oh, it&#8217;s going to go any second. But it just failed to go.</p>\n<p>After 35 minutes, cars were leaving the ground in droves and we were four goals in front. And I blame ourselves, up to a point. I think we sort of relaxed, thinking the game was won.</p>\n<p>And one bloke by the name of Gordon Byron drove into Wangaratta, through he&#8217;d switch on the wireless and see what the final score was.

the Picola Football League and his unlikely role in bringing home the Premiership for Waaia.</p>\n<p>Archival video courtesy of Adrian Bennett. Thank you to Waaia Football Club and Tom Greenaway.</p>\n<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>MICK CLEELAND:  Well, that&#8217;s the situation. We were five points down. We had a boundary throw-in over here. Ball gets thrown in, gets knocked down, gets tapped back towards me.</p>\n<p>Miraculously enough, I&#8217;d been paid a free kick for too high. I&#8217;m not sure that the free kick was there. To this day, we still haven&#8217;t worked out what happened there. A Blighty player, after he hears the whistle for the free kick, slams the ball on the ground, 50 meters.</p>\n<p>[SIREN BLARES]</p>\n<p>Siren goes. Everything erupts. Opposition, Blighty, come tearing out of here. They think they&#8217;ve won the game. The scores were 15-18 to 18-5 at that stage, so they had every right to think they were&#8212; with 18 goals on the board that they&#8217;d won the game.</p>\n<p>[CROWD CHEERING]</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve still got the ball in me hand. Umpire comes over and says, you can take your kick.

They communicate through movement and telepathic frequencies, having evolved beyond language. As they prepare for birth, their internal thoughts are projected through the soundscape, carrying us from moonlight to daybreak, over and over. Swimming through bass-heavy tides, this work seeks to transport you not forward or backward, but to expand you into the present moment, where past, present, and future are intertwined as one.</p>\n<p>“We rot and become god again. Impregnated with possibility, I birth new dawns. Open. Fecund. Cycles. Spiral up, up, up with me. I see you. I see you in the ocean; I see you in the lava. Stay open. Stay tender every chance you get. Split your heart wide open and let it expand with me.

Static and inarticulate frequencies, or white noise, layer the visuals in place of the characters&#8217; speech and screams and create an aural sense of distortion and displacement for the viewer in the use of surround sound.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Language", "display_values": ["No spoken word"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["G"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Digital Art", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Desire", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Gender identity", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Interpersonal conflict", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Love", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Sex", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Voyeurism", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Voyeurism", "Mixed media", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Popular culture", "Performance"]}, {"label": "Materials", "display_values": ["Multi channel moving image"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1788725, "name": "Monika Tichacek", "creator_id": 9278, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "creator", "role_id": 968, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "Mini DV; Master", "identifier": "", "description": ""}, {"name": "DVD [PAL]; Exhibition Copy", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "2728", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2004", "notes": "", "to_year": "2004"}], "labels": [53676], "external_references": []}, {"id": 120322, "acmi_id": "B2004673", "title": "Wildcats and Pipedreams", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "wildcats-and-pipedreams", "creator_credit": "Kestrel Film & Television, John Richardson and David Greig", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1985", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1985-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "brief_description": "<p>Wildcats and Pipedreams follows the crew of an oil drilling rig in the Timor Sea.

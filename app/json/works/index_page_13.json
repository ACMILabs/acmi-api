Kunoth-Monks discusses her education at St Mary&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hostel, Alice Springs, and on being discovered by Charles and Elsa Chauvel as the lead in &#8220;Jedda&#8221;. She talks about working on the film, and her family&#8217;s response to it, in particular the sexual references. A greater passion was to help people, and Rosalie joined the Community of the Holy Name in Melbourne and was a nun for ten years, also gaining training during this period in childcare. Working as an Aboriginal liaison officer in Victoria after leaving the sisterhood, Kunoth-Monks also established the first Aboriginal Family Group home, in addition to marrying during this period.

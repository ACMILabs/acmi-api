Filled with enigmatic glimpses, gestures and images seeming to come from half-remembered dreams, memories and snatches of conversations, this archive contains hints for unearthing the many secrets of contemporary metropolitan life.<br />\nIn the mid 1990s Cohen encountered a series of advertisements for a New York City &#8216;Phone Confession Line&#8217;.To call in and confess was free; to listen cost money. Cohen acquired recordings of these taped confessions of murderous thoughts, desire and treachery, and used them to form the audio heartbeat of his video installation &#8216;Black Hole Radio&#8217;. Accompanied by ghostly Super 8 images filmed by the artist during his nocturnal wanderings, the installation reveals the anonymous lives and restless spirits that haunt the phonelines, televisions and sleepless nights of the city.<br />\nFor this version of the installation, ACMI has worked with the artist to create a small confessional cell where images shimmer like paranoid hallucinations while disturbing whispers hang in mid-air, semi-publicly. The elusive images that linger on the edge of visual perception provide the evidence of Cohen&#8217;s investigation into the small confessed &#8216;crimes&#8217;: loving the wrong man, harbouring hatred or greed. Visitors leave &#8216;Black Hole Radio&#8217; feeling the way they do when a shameful memory wakes them in the dead of night.

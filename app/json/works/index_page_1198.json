At her beguiling best, Deborah Kerr plays a prim English lady whose husband has vanished into the jungle while searching for the legendary mines of King Solomon. Stewart Granger&#8217;s portrayal of Allan Quartermain, &#8220;white hunter&#8221; and reluctant leader of the danger fraught expedition, is one of the finest roles of his swashbuckling career. &#8220;King Solomon&#8217;s Mines&#8221; offers a colourful palette of action, danger, suspense, drama and romance. Particularly exciting are the extraordinary animal stampedes captured by Robert Sutees&#8217; Oscar winning cinematography.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Action & Adventure", "Action & Adventure&nbsp;→ Swashbucklers", "Adaptations", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "History&nbsp;→ Swashbucklers", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations", "Literature&nbsp;→ Literature"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/king-solomons-mines", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1986643, "name": "Andrew Marton", "creator_id": 25045, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q506183", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986642, "name": "Compton Bennett", "creator_id": 25044, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q466415", "role": "co-director", "role_id": 959, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986641, "name": "Sam Zimbalist", "creator_id": 76868, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1362717", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986639, "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "creator_id": 66514, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1986640, "name": "United Artists Corporation", "creator_id": 20365, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q219400", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1986638, "name": "Victorian Council for Children's Films and Television", "creator_id": 72735, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "38819", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1950", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1950"}], "labels": [22406]}, {"id": 115683, "acmi_id": "F000030", "title": "Letyat zhuravli = The Cranes are flying", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "letyat-zhuravli-the-cranes-are-flying", "creator_credit": "Mikhail Kalatozov and Mosfilm", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Soviet Union, 1958", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1958-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [{"id": 52899, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q714524"}], "brief_description": "<p>An anti-war love story set during the early years of World War II, &#8216;The Cranes Are Flying&#8217; is a romantic drama about love, loss and recovery from catastrophe.

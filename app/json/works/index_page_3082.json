This original version of &#8220;The Raven&#8221;, through its use of black and white cinematography, brings out the evil and horror in Poe&#8217;s classic tale - shadowy silhouettes, dark stormy nights, howling winds, flashes of lightning, hidden dungeons, torture chambers - all the necessary ingredients, plus the superb, if somewhat melodramatic, acting by the cast, particularly Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Cast also includes Lester Matthews, Inez Courtney, Spencer Charters, Ian Wolfe, Maidel Turner.

Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton are excellent as two young lovers working out their shared dependency on each other and on heroin, and they are well supported by a supporting cast that includes Holly Hunter, Denis Leary and Dennis Hopper. Though the material is harsh and confronting, &#8220;Jesus&#8217; Son&#8221; also emerges as a deeply optimistic and humane drama. This is an excellent example of a film work that remains true to the mood and emotional intensity of its original source text, but which also creatively re-imagines and develops the story for another medium.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:43:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Road movies", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Drug abuse", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Heroin habit", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Love", "Literature&nbsp;→ American literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/jesus-son", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1996684, "name": "Alison MacLean", "creator_id": 7932, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q4727134", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996682, "name": "David Urrutial", "creator_id": 79986, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036713", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996680, "name": "Elizabeth Cutherell", "creator_id": 79985, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121036365", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996681, "name": "Lydia Dean Pilcher", "creator_id": 29543, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q16734532", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996683, "name": "Margot Bridger", "creator_id": 79987, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q121337385", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996677, "name": "Alliance Atlantis", "creator_id": 30788, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q10748653", "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996678, "name": "Blue Sky Studios", "creator_id": 34323, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1996679, "name": "Evenstar", "creator_id": 34324, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1996676, "name": "Shock Records", "creator_id": 79920, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50301", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1999", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1999"}], "labels": [32283]}, {"id": 92784, "acmi_id": "316113", "title": "Look back in anger", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "look-back-in-anger", "creator_credit": "Tony Richardson, Harry Saltzman and Woodfall Film Productions", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1948", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1948-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 46302, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1610858"}], "brief_description": "<p>Attacking the issues of established values, &#8220;Look back in anger&#8221; is an explosive sex-charged film based on the play written by John Osborne that managed to shock the world in its day.

"brief_description": "<p>William (Billy) Darbyshire (1903–1979) was a film enthusiast and traveller who emigrated with his parents from England to Australia in 1911. It may have been this early trip that influenced a young Billy to travel the world later in life and film his travels as he went.</p>\n<p>First travelling to Africa for work and to various destinations whilst in service during WWII, Billy would continue to travel after the war throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, the Pacific and North America. It was in this period, during the 1960s, that he purchased an 8mm movie camera which resulted in a collection of films that capture his travels, taking in the sites of the world from Asia to Europe and Africa to the Americas.</p>\n<p>The films were originally made using Standard 8mm film. The quality of the film can be a little challenging as it is jumpy, damaged and scratched at times.</p>\n<p>This film contains scenes of Billy’s travels on the steamship Southern Cross, in 1960 which travelled between Australia and Europe. It is a little difficult to locate exactly where Billy visits but we can definitely see scenes of England, the Netherlands and Greece. The SS Southern Cross was a modern passenger ship built in 1955 to an innovative design which catered specifically for the tourist trade, starting a trend of ‘aft-engined’ ships, leaving more space for passengers and their needs.

He soon realises to stay in this new world with high-powered corporate espionage player Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) he must break a few rules. Gekko represents one of three father figures for Fox, the other two being his real father and his boss at the broking firm, all of whom give him constant advice. However, Fox&#8217;s overwhelming desire for gold cufflinks and brick-like cellular phones steer him down the path of corruption and greed and he soon realises the price of the pursuit of overnight success. Director Oliver Stone captures the hectic hum of the commerce world and encapsulates the greed that is synonymous with the rise of capitalism in the 1980s. Michael Douglas received an Oscar for Best Actor at the 1987 Academy Awards for his role as Gekko.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:01:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "English", "English", "English", "Hebrew", "Hungarian", "Icelandic", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Swedish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Academy awards (Motion pictures)", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ambition", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Avarice", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Commerce", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Finance", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Stock exchanges", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/wall-street", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 962668, "name": "Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation", "creator_id": 12599, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962669, "name": "Edward Pressman", "creator_id": 23171, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 962670, "name": "Oliver Stone", "creator_id": 53327, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 962667, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51212", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1987", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1987"}], "labels": [33098], "external_references": [{"id": 999, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q332348"}, {"id": 6571, "source": {"name": "TMDB-Movie", "slug": "tmdb-movie"}, "source_identifier": "10673"}]}]}

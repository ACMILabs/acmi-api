Nelly is struggling with their financial situation, juggling several odd jobs to make ends meet. One day she meets by chance at a restaurant, Mr Arnaud. He is an elderly, retired judge, reasonably well off and estranged from his wife and children. Arnaud, a complete stranger, offers to pay her debts, no strings attached, and Nelly reluctantly agrees. Intrigued by Nelly, Arnaud employs her to help him record his memoirs. Nelly is depicted as a somewhat aloof woman searching for a connection to those around her. Mr Arnaud is a man near the end of his life, financially secure but dwelling on past regrets, both personal and professional.

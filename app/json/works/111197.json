Phu’s low and sleek Nissan Turbo has everything that can open and shut – all digital of course, with every ‘after market’ improvement possible. Electric blue LEDs glow, exotic dials flicker, buttons and knobs are there for the pressing and tweaking: it’s a bit like having a low-flying spaceship in a suburban shed.

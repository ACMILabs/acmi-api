Using mockumentary footage and interviews, &#8220;The Rutles&#8221; documents the pre-fab four&#8217;s journey right through to their messy break up and post-Rutle lives. Idle plays a series of characters including Rutle Dirk and a hapless BBC type interviewer who narrates the film. &#8220;The Rutles&#8221; mocks the BBC, documentary filmmakers, and The Beatles&#8217; films and music. Features excerpts from The Rutles films - Yellow Submarine Sandwich, Tragical History Tour, OUCH!, and A Hard Day&#8217;s Rut.

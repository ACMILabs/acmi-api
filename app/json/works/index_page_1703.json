Convinced by an eloquent heretic that all Adventists are to burn in hell the following Saturday, Elkin fears that his true love for the pastors&#8217; daughter will never be consummated - but the world doesn&#8217;t end. Arriving in Sydney in 1962 to attend University, Elkin encounters the world&#8217;s end for a second time while besieging the wealthy and beautiful Jennie O&#8217;Brien (Miranda Otto) with his misguided affection. Believing that with the Cuba Missile Crisis the end of world is truly nigh, the paranoid Elkin persuades Jennie to flee Sydney for the safety of the nearby mountains. However, the much longed for apocalypse is once again postponed and he returns to face the wrath of Jennie&#8217;s father.

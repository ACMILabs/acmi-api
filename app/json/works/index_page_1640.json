Set around the working class neighbourhoods of New York City, the film is an engaging comedy about the fears and difficulties involved in learning to trust another person. Terrence McNally wrote the script which is based on his acclaimed play, &#8220;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&#8221;. One of the great joys of this film are the uniformly excellent performances. The cast includes Kate Nelligan as Frankie&#8217;s fellow waitress; Nathan Lane as her generous spirited gay flat-mate; and the under-rated Hector Helizondo as Nick, the owner of the Greek restaurant in which Frankie and Johnny work.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["MA"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1987740, "name": "Garry Marshall", "creator_id": 72136, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987739, "name": "Garry Marshall", "creator_id": 72136, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987738, "name": "Nick Abdo", "creator_id": 77507, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1987737, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "creator_id": 11230, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 1987736, "name": "Vidz Of Oz", "creator_id": 72738, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "39833", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1991", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1991"}], "labels": [23388], "external_references": []}, {"id": 83892, "acmi_id": "305164", "title": "The Last picture show", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-last-picture-show", "creator_credit": "Peter Bogdanovich, Stephen J.

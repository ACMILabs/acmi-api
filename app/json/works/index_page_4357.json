This is great collection about an iconic artist at work that is accompanied by fascinating commentaries, a glossy booklet and an extensive interview with the artists.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p>Since the early 1960s Christo and Jean-Claude&#8217;s large-scale temporary works of art have worked to change our perceptions of the relationship between art and society - so writes famed documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles, a close friend of the Christos&#8217; who has, over the decades, studied their numerous struggles to see their art realised. In these five documentaries Christo and his wife&#8217;s work habits are laid bare including their ambitions and conflicts with bureaucrats which constitute a significant portion of their work. Works include: &#8220;Christos Valley Curtain&#8221; Academy Award nominated film that celebrates the hanging of a huge orange curtain between two Colorado mountains. &#8220;Running Fence&#8221; An engrossing document of the efforts to build a 24 and 1/2 mile long, 18 foot high fence of white fabric across the hills of Northern California. &#8220;Islands&#8221; Christo and Jean-Claude fight to surround eleven islands in Miami&#8217;s Biscayne Bay with 6.5 million square feet of bright pink fabric. &#8220;Christo in Paris&#8221; The wrapping of the Pont Neuf in Paris and a portrait of the artists lasting love affair. &#8220;Umbrellas&#8221; Thousands of umbrellas are simultaneously opened in rice-farming valley in Japan and across a cluster of cattle ranches in southern California.

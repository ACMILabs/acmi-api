Sam&#8217;s successful running of the Tangiers is soon jeopardised by Nicky&#8217;s hotheaded thuggery and the explosive behaviour of his coke-addicted wife Ginger (Sharon Stone). &#8220;Casino&#8221; is Martin Scorsese&#8217;s tribute to a Las Vegas now gone. The film is marked with Scorsese&#8217;s usual visual flair and kinetic style, with a deadpan voiceover narration from Sam and occasionally Nicky. Sharon Stone gives a knockout performance as the unstable Ginger.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["02:58:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["Czech", "Danish", "Dutch", "English", "English", "English", "German", "Italian", "Norwegian", "Polish", "Portuguese", "Spanish"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["R (18+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Motion picture trailers", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Italian Americans", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Mafia - United States", "Crime, Espionage, Justice, Police & Prisons&nbsp;→ Organized crime - United States", "Drama", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Cocaine", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Hobbies, Recreation & Sport&nbsp;→ Gambling", "Places&nbsp;→ Las Vegas (Nev.)"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/casino", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2131348, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "creator_id": 3485, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q41148", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2131347, "name": "Barbara de Fina", "creator_id": 23666, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2131346, "name": "Universal Pictures", "creator_id": 67048, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2131345, "name": "Universal Music Publishing", "creator_id": 78799, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "DVD; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51639", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [33356], "external_references": []}]}

In season four, Max (Sadie Sink) is saved from villain Vecna’s spell by her friends playing Bush’s “Running Up That Hill”. Not only did the scene shoot the song into Billboard’s top 10 for the first time in 37 years, it’s been adopted by internet users who’ve wondered what song would save them. One Twitter account tried answer that question by remixing contemporary songs into the scene, showing how online ingenuity can bridge the cultural past and present while allowing viewers to participate in moving image making.</p>\n<p>Social media users across the internet have also used special effects programs to show themselves levitating, or running out of the Upside Down from Vecna, often to their favourite songs, which they&#8217;ve edited into the visuals. This has allowed the scene to spawn numerous meme templates. </p>\n<p>The personal element of the narrative - that your favourite song can save you from evil - and the nostalgia of the series lends itself to users contributing their own songs (and associated emotions) to the visuals, creating a personal but collective, shareable experience. </p>\n<p>Another prominent meme created from <i>Stranger Things 4</i> relies on sound. Before claiming his victims, Vecna makes them hallucinate a ticking grandfather clock (among other things) and its ominous chime (used to great effect in horror movies forever) has become an eerie indicator that he&#8217;s coming for you. Naturally, TikTokers have appropriated the sound for comedic effect. <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stranger-things-grandfather-clock\">Know Your Meme traces the first use of it to user @marcusbtv</a>, who hears it in a skit about gaming, removes one headphone and says &#8220;Nope&#8230;.. not getting me&#8221;, before going back to playing. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s now been repurposed and reused across the internet, with users often engaging with an invisible clock (they&#8217;re hallucinating) or even Big Ben.</p>", "description_for_label": ["<p><i>Stranger Things</i> has introduced Zoomers to another 80s icon: pop star Kate Bush.

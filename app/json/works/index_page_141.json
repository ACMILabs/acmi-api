Chronically alcoholic for years, she is brought out of her stupor with the news of her husband&#8217;s suicide and revelations about the state of his business. Vincent has left seven diamonds of dubious provenance for Marianne. This is enough for Marianne to decide to sober up, revive her shattered career as a diamond expert and try to sell the gems.

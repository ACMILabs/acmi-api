Various eccentrics people the Montmarte district, where Amelie is a waitress; identifying their needs, and those of her neighbours, Amelie sets into motion elaborate plans to (anonymously) relieve their ailments. Amelie&#8217;s schemes are both ingenious and creative but she neglects her own desires, in particular her burgeoning romantic feelings for Nino, a patron at her cafe. &#8220;Amelie&#8221; utilises computer-generated images to reflect the emotional essence of the protagonists&#8217; state and presents a fantastical Montmarte that is awash in glorious colour, markedly absent of graffiti or unsavoury elements. Unlike the previous features of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, City of lost children), the film&#8217;s mise-en-scene works at conveying a light-hearted whimsy about the life of its heroine and her environs, determinedly steering away from the dark side.

Isabelle (Isabelle Huppert) is an ex-nun awaiting an expected mission from God while making a living writing stories for pornographic magazines. She meets the kind and confused Thomas (Martin Donovan), who is suffering from amnesia and wandering the streets of New York in search of clues to his past, a past of viciousness and exploitation that only the appearance of his traumatized porn queen ex-wife, Sophia (Elina Lowensohn), begins to unravel. Intertwined with suspenseful thriller qualities and the subtlety of an unlikely romance, this film quietly spirals into a poignant tale of the pursuit of the reality of identity through memory and engagement with the past which leads sensitively to the inevitable tragedy of the final showdown.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:41:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["M (15+)"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Pornography", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Comedy", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - United States", "Food, Health, Lifestyle, Medicine, Psychology & Safety&nbsp;→ Amnesia", "Places&nbsp;→ New York (N.Y.)", "Romance"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/amateur", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2087924, "name": "Hal Hartley", "creator_id": 10205, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q446294", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2087921, "name": "Hal Hartley", "creator_id": 10205, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q446294", "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2087917, "name": "Ted Hope", "creator_id": 77844, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "co-producer", "role_id": 915, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2087913, "name": "True Fiction Pictures", "creator_id": 27087, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2087911, "name": "Zenith Entertainment", "creator_id": 32671, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2087908, "name": "UGC Images", "creator_id": 25649, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "48410", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 2, "name": "United States", "slug": "united-states"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1994", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1994"}], "labels": [30569], "external_references": []}]}

In Part three, &#8220;From wild woods to town gardens&#8221;, Dick and the woodland expert Oliver Rackham discuss the concept of the wild wood as opposed to the plantation, and go in search of rare species of native trees. Dick then compares the wild wood to the town garden, examining why people often overlook native trees in urban spaces. With Simon Hodge from the Forestry Commission, he scrutinises examples of good and bad tree planting, and offers general advice to people wishing to plant trees.

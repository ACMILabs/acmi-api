Sister Thomas, (Anna Massey) is a major contributor to the atmosphere of intellectual, sexual and emotional repression at the convent school, where no signs of affection are tolerated. Excellently acted and constructed, this film exposes some of the myths and rituals which make up our perceptions of convent schools. The cast also includes Katrin Carlidge and Oona Kirsh.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:27:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Convents and nunneries - Great Britain", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - Great Britain"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 953094, "name": "Barbara Rennie", "creator_id": 26682, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953093, "name": "Dee Dee Glass", "creator_id": 26681, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 953092, "name": "Reality Productions", "creator_id": 26680, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "video_links": [], "media_note": null, "images": [{"id": 18017, "image_file": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg", "image_file_thumbnail": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "image_file_xs": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg.480x480_q85.jpg", "image_file_s": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg.960x960_q85.jpg", "image_file_m": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg.1920x1920_q85.jpg", "image_file_l": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/8HMpDK7WvSXzOZKUleicGeAeDwi.jpg.3840x3840_q85.jpg", "caption": "Sacred hearts (Barbara Rennie) still", "credit_line": "Image via TMDb", "alt_text": "", "width": 1200, "height": 1600, "access_level": "View anywhere"}], "videos": [], "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "40747", "production_places": [{"id": 10, "name": "United Kingdom", "slug": "united-kingdom"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1984", "notes": "Produced", "to_year": "1984"}], "labels": [24275]}]}

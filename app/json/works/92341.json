In &#8220;The Firm&#8221; we see the nastier violent side of soccer and soccer gangs. Bex Bissek (Gary Oldman) is a respectable estate agent during the week who loves his wife and son but when the weekend arrives, he loves nothing better than to get together with his &#8220;firm&#8221; and give someone a good kicking. His &#8220;firm&#8221; is a gang of football supporters known as the Inter-City Crew, of which Bex is the leader.

Their main adrenalin hit is violence, with a good dose of alcohol, and Stuttgart is where the action will take place - a chance to take on the Germans, or anyone else who gets in their way. Knives, sledgehammers and baseball bats are their weapons. Extremely graphic and containing some disturbing images, &#8220;The Firm&#8221; caused huge controversy when it was aired in 1989.

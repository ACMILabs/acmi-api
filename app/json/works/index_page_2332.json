Shortly after September 11 2001, Syrian born Rana Kabbani, returned to the Middle East to find out how Muslims have come to view the United States. Her journey took her to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Iran. She wanted to know why there was so much hatred towards America. Was it religious - Muslims against Christians - or were there other reasons for this apparent hatred? And yet for all the hatred and anger towards America, many Arabs expressed sympathy for the American people and made it clear that they did not condone terrorism or what occurred on September 11. The United States however is accused of interference and domination, hypocrisy and double standards, exploiting the Middle East for its oil and using their land for its military bases - 27,000 American military personnel are currently based in the desert of Egypt. This documentary presents a Muslim perspective from the street Arabs to the intelligentsia and includes interviews with Egyptian filmmaker Khaled Youssef (&#8220;The Storm&#8221;), Iraqui musician Naseer Shamma, Palestinian journalist Atef Helwa, Sheik Nahyan one of the ruling elite in the United Arab Emirates, various academics and and a group of American Christian students on a study tour of the Middle East. Also discusses America&#8217;s close relationship with Israel, its past occupations, bombings and economic exploitations which have affected many countries around the world, but particularly the Islamic countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Palestine. A most interesting insight into the hearts and minds of a people often portrayed in a damming way by the politicians and media of the West. Contains archival and some b&amp;w footage.

Whilst the reign of Napoleon III collapsed, a disgruntled group of commoners decided to take charge, creating their own commune within Paris, thus forming a separatist government that adhered to a type of Marxist ethos. In Watkins&#8217; treatment of the event, he effectively critiques modern media as well as commenting upon the illusive and subjective nature of history. Over 200 mostly non-professional actors re-enact the era, slipping in and out of character, discussing their views on the events they are representing. Two rival 19th century TV stations report on the insurrection; one is directed from within the commune and the other is a CNN type of organisation presenting a sensationalist view. Frightened Parisians are interviewed and argue constantly about the validity of the issues, including the rights of women, education issues, the role of the Church and freedom of the press, as the battle for Paris rages. Watkins&#8217; film is a fascinating view of a little known historical period as well as an evocative and thought-provoking meditation upon our media saturated lives and the power of television. Watkins challenges the constraints of documentary filmmaking dictated by networks and liberates his six-hour story from such limitations.

At one and a half times the size of the United States, it has a population of only 800 people. Three quarters of the world&#8217;s fresh water envelops it in a layer of ice so thick it conceals mountain ranges as vast as the Alps. With temperatures below 70 degrees C. and winds of 120mph, Antarctica is the coldest, loneliest place on Earth. However, it is also a place of majestic beauty which can support astonishingly rich and varied forms of wildlife.

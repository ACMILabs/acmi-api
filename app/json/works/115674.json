Over the course of the film the three sisters and the family maid, Anna, examine their past, lamenting dark and tumultuous moments. Maria is a self-centred, vain, exquisite beauty, with a shallow perspective; Karin, bitter and frigid has a history of self-mutilation and contemplates suicide; Agnes, in immense pain, is comforted by Anna the fatalistic family retainer. Bergman artfully explores the inner life of the women, detailing the history of their connectedness yet isolation from each other. With flashbacks and minimal dialogue Bergman lays out the emotional landscape of this family&#8217;s fragile bonds that strain under the imminent death of one. Clocks are a repeated motif for the passage of time, and a reminder of the women&#8217;s mortality; sound and colour play an important part in the narrative with red (wine, walls, curtains) representing the soul&#8217;s interior.

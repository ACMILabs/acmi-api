A departure from Yimou&#8217;s earlier visually sumptuous, period dramas &#8216;Raise the Red Lantern&#8217; and &#8216;Ju Dou&#8217;, this film adopts a plainer visual style and a satrical tone in observations of contemporary Chinese life and its critique of an overblown and hopelessly ineffective government bureacracy. Based on the novel &#8216;The Wan Family&#8217;s Lawsuit&#8217; by Chen Yuan Bin. Cast includes Gong Li and Lei Que Sheng.

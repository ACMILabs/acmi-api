A ground breaking production for its unique combination of seemingly disparate performance cultures, &#8220;Chushingura&#8221; was the result of detailed research into the history of Kabuki theatre and dance and consultation with contemporary practitioners of the form. In footage of rehearsals and in interviews with Bejart and the Tokyo Ballet dancers, this process is discussed along with the themes that Bejart was exploring in the preparation for and final production of the ballet, complimented by mirrored sequences depicting a Kabuki performance of the popular tale and Bejart&#8217;s ballet. This documentary was also the Grand Prix Winner of the International Emmy Awards in 1986.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:51:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Crafts & Visual Arts&nbsp;→ Performance art", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballet companies", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Ballets - Film and video adaptations", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Choreography", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancers - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Dancing - Japan", "Music & Performing Arts&nbsp;→ Kabuki", "Performance", "Performance&nbsp;→ Ballet - Performance", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Japan"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 2111271, "name": "Kiichiro Ito", "creator_id": 34420, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111269, "name": "Kanae Mayuzumi", "creator_id": 34419, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 2111268, "name": "Nihon Hoso Kyokai", "creator_id": 13056, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 2111267, "name": "Marcom", "creator_id": 76286, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "50236", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 8, "name": "Japan", "slug": "japan"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1985", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1985"}], "labels": [32228]}, {"id": 95595, "acmi_id": "319845", "title": "Being me", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "being-me-dvd", "creator_credit": "Keryn James, Susan Redden and ABC-TV (Australia)", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2004", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "TV show", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "2004-01-01T11:00:00+11:00", "commissioned": false, "external_references": [], "brief_description": "<p>Being Me is an ABC health series for students in middle to upper primary school years, that &#8220;encourages kids to know themselves, like themselves and be themselves&#8221; (ABC).

It has mainstream appeal, strengthened by its dubbed English dialogue with thick American accents. The story, which follows a group of young and ambitious locals, would have struck a chord with the country&#8217;s youth population. The use of contemporary Peking as the backdrop to the story further conveys the film&#8217;s desire to situate itself within the modern world.<br />\n(4 stars - Aleena Glentis; October 11, 2012)</p>", "constellations_primary": [], "constellations_other": [], "recommendations": [], "title_for_label": "<p>Beijing kebabs = Hei ko men erh!</p>", "creator_credit_for_label": "<p>Wang Fengkui and Changchun Film Studio</p>", "headline_credit_for_label": "<p>China, 1987</p>", "description": "<p>In bustling Peking, Haizi is berated by his parents for his failure to pass his university entrance exam three consecutive times.

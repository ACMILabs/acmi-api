Finally, &#8216;In a cup of Tea&#8217;s&#8216; grimly surreal coda of a publisher&#8217;s frustration with the inconclusiveness of many Japanese ghost stories, aptly completes this remarkable anthology. Kobayashi&#8217;s meticulous direction, (Kobayashi&#8217;s obsessive aesthetic control drove him to hand paint all the sets himself) along with the unsettling soundtrack by Toru Takemitsu make this a unique film experience.

Even though the film itself is vastly enjoyable as a narrative of adolescent rites of passage, it can also be read as an attempt to re-interrogate the cultural and historical legacy of French decolonisation and of the generation of 1968; the generation whose work and ideologies were to overwhelm French cinema and aesthetics for over two decades. &#8220;Wild reeds&#8221;, like &#8220;La haine&#8221;, &#8220;World without pity&#8221; and &#8220;Irma Vep&#8221;, is a sign of the renewal of French cinema - the exploration of new terrain and the possible reconciliation of past struggles and disruptions. This is a wonderful film. The outstanding cinematography is by Jeanne Lapoirie. The cast include Elodie Bouchez, Gael Morel, Stephane Rideau and Frederic Gorny.

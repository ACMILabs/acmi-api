Even though the film itself is vastly enjoyable as a narrative of adolescent rites of passage, it can also be read as an attempt to re-interrogate the cultural and historical legacy of French decolonisation and of the generation of 1968; the generation whose work and ideologies were to overwhelm French cinema and aesthetics for over two decades. &#8220;Wild reeds&#8221;, like &#8220;La haine&#8221;, &#8220;World without pity&#8221; and &#8220;Irma Vep&#8221;, is a sign of the renewal of French cinema - the exploration of new terrain and the possible reconciliation of past struggles and disruptions. This is a wonderful film. The outstanding cinematography is by Jeanne Lapoirie. The cast include Elodie Bouchez, Gael Morel, Stephane Rideau and Frederic Gorny.

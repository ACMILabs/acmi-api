Set in the slums of Glasgow, it focuses on Joe (played superbly by Peter Mullan), a reformed alcoholic who makes a living out of odd jobs and derives much enjoyment from coaching the local soccer team. He gets a new lease on life, however, when he meets and falls in love with Sarah (Louise Goodall), a healthcare worker. Things begin to fall apart when Joe is pulled back into the world of drugs and crime in order to save his friend, Liam (David McKay), whose life is at stake when he can&#8217;t pay back the local drug lords for his partner&#8217;s heroin addiction. Sarah&#8217;s disapproval of the underworld and Joe&#8217;s connections to it pushes their relationship to breaking point and Joe to the very edge. Loach&#8217;s film combines a razor-sharp portrayal of unemployed and working-class life in Glasgow with strong doses of melodrama.

A young middle-class Australian woman falls in love with a young intellectual Indian whilst at university during the 1950s. They eventually marry and the Australian woman leaves her country to begin a new life in India as a wife and mother. This is an extraordinary documentary about living in a different culture and the way a nation&#8217;s political and historical turmoil impacts upon the lives of ordinary individuals. It weaves together first-person interviews, historic footage and present-day shots of India in a very beautiful and poetic way. The poignant and heartfelt quality of this documentary derives from the fact that the filmmaker, Safina Uberoi, is the daughter of this mixed racial couple, and the film is her personal quest for identity. Throughout she becomes reacquainted with her parents and her Indian grandparents and comes to fully understand and appreciate the kinds of sacrifices they made and suffering they endured. Ultimately, however, &#8220;My mother India&#8221; is a daughter paying homage to her mother and the tough decision she made a generation ago that now allows her daughter to move freely between two radically different countries and cultures. Winner of several awards including Best Australian Documentary, Real Life on Film Documentary Festival; Jury Prize for Best Australian Documentary, Australian Film Critics Circle; Special Jury Award, Hawaii International Film Festival; Best Long-Form Documentary, Australian Teachers of Media Awards.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["00:52:00:00"]}, {"label": "Language", "display_values": ["English"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Film festivals - Australia - Sydney - Awards", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Australians", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ Family - India", "Anthropology, Ethnology, Exploration & Travel&nbsp;→ India - Social life and customs", "Biographical", "Documentary", "Documentary&nbsp;→ Documentary films - Australia", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Culture conflict", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Ethnicity", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Family - Social aspects", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ India - Social conditions", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Intermarriage", "Economics, Philosophy, Politics, Religion & Sociology&nbsp;→ Multiculturalism", "Education, Instruction, Teaching & Schools&nbsp;→ Cross-cultural studies", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Children - Family relationships", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - India", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Family - Psychological aspects", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Intermarriage", "Family, Gender Identity, Relationships & Sexuality&nbsp;→ Mothers and daughters", "History&nbsp;→ Biography", "People&nbsp;→ Biography", "Short films", "Short films&nbsp;→ Short films - Australia"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [], "creators_primary": [{"id": 820337, "name": "Chili Films", "creator_id": 32889, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 820338, "name": "SBS Independent", "creator_id": 60293, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 820339, "name": "Penny McDonald", "creator_id": 73344, "role": "producer", "role_id": 960, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 820340, "name": "Safina Uberoi", "creator_id": 11019, "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [{"id": 820336, "name": "Ronin Films", "creator_id": 6257, "role": "distributor", "role_id": 437, "is_primary": false}], "video_links": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we don't have images or video for this item.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "52500", "production_places": [{"id": 3, "name": "Australia", "slug": "australia"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "2001", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "2001"}], "labels": [34046]}, {"id": 95530, "acmi_id": "319700", "title": "My man Godfrey (1957)", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "my-man-godfrey-1957", "creator_credit": "Universal Pictures, Ross Hunter and Henry Koster", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1957", "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "first_production_date": "1957-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "brief_description": "<p>This remake of the classic 1936 screwball comedy, stars June Allyson in the key role of the kooky heiress who falls for her butler.

Based on the novel &#8216;A Judgement in Stone&#8217; by Ruth Rendell the film centres on a wealthy liberal couple living in rural Brittany who employ Sophie, a taciturn young woman, as a live-in maid. Initially satisfied with her work they become disapproving when she forms a close bond with the irreverent local postmistress. Their strange friendship and increasingly odd antics make the family increasingly suspicious of Sophie and when they finally reject her, the two friends exact a chilling revenge. This film is widely considered to mark Chabrol&#8217;s return to form as a director of thrillers. Cast includes Isabelle Huppert, Sandrine Bonnaire, Jacqeline Bisset and Jean-Pierre Cassel.</p>"], "credit_line_for_label": "", "details": [{"label": "Duration", "display_values": ["01:48:00:00"]}, {"label": "Languages", "display_values": ["English", "French"]}, {"label": "Audience classification", "display_values": ["PG"]}, {"label": "Subject categories", "display_values": ["Adaptations", "Advertising, Film, Journalism, Mass Media & TV&nbsp;→ Foreign language films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Crime films", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Suspense", "Courtroom, Crime, Espionage & Thrillers&nbsp;→ Thrillers", "Drama", "Drama&nbsp;→ Psychodrama", "Feature films", "Feature films&nbsp;→ Feature films - France", "Foreign language films", "Literature&nbsp;→ English literature - Film and video adaptations"]}, {"label": "Sound/audio", "display_values": ["Sound"]}, {"label": "Colour", "display_values": ["Colour"]}], "stats": {"tap_count": 0}, "links": [{"url": "https://www.justwatch.com/au/movie/a-judgement-in-stone", "title": "Stream, rent or buy at <span>JustWatch</span>", "source": "justwatch"}], "creators_primary": [{"id": 1998014, "name": "Claude Chabrol", "creator_id": 25145, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q55375", "role": "director", "role_id": 938, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998013, "name": "Marin Karmitz", "creator_id": 22337, "creator_wikidata_id": "Q1383621", "role": "producer", "role_id": 1089, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998010, "name": "Canal+", "creator_id": 71755, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998012, "name": "France 3 Cinema", "creator_id": 27078, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998009, "name": "MK2 Productions", "creator_id": 27077, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}, {"id": 1998011, "name": "Olga-Film", "creator_id": 35418, "creator_wikidata_id": null, "role": "production company", "role_id": 941, "is_primary": true}], "creators_other": [], "media_note": "Sorry, we aren't able to make images or video for this item available to the public online.", "holdings": [{"name": "VHS; Access Print (Section 1)", "identifier": "", "description": ""}], "part_of": null, "parts": [], "part_siblings": [], "group": null, "group_works": [], "group_siblings": [], "source": {"name": "Vernon", "slug": "vernon"}, "source_identifier": "51201", "eaas_environment_id": null, "production_places": [{"id": 17, "name": "France", "slug": "france"}], "production_dates": [{"date": "1995", "notes": "Copyrighted", "to_year": "1995"}], "labels": [33087]}, {"id": 93583, "acmi_id": "317092", "title": "The Bad and the beautiful", "title_annotation": "", "slug": "the-bad-and-the-beautiful", "creator_credit": "Vincente Minnelli, John Houseman and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "credit_line": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 1952", "video_links": [], "record_type": "work", "type": "Film", "is_on_display": false, "last_on_display_place": null, "last_on_display_date": null, "is_context_indigenous": false, "material_description": "", "unpublished": false, "external": false, "first_production_date": "1952-01-01T10:00:00+10:00", "commissioned": false, "public_domain": false, "external_references": [{"id": 47939, "source": {"name": "Wikidata", "slug": "wikidata"}, "source_identifier": "Q1345583"}], "brief_description": "<p>The Bad and the beautiful casts a sharp eye on the studio system of Hollywood and its machinations.

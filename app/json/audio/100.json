The fabric has a metallic sheen that is reminiscent of armour. Tilly rarely lets her guard down and continues to endure immense hardship fighting the constant attacks of the townsfolk. The costume shows Tilly’s serious side, and its darker tones perhaps reflect the underlying darkness that drives her story. Designer Margot Wilson was solely responsible for creating Tilly’s (Kate Winslet) wardrobe, and they collaborated closely to get the best fit and style. This dress is perfectly tailored to Winslet’s form. It showcases the meticulous craftsmanship needed to make the highly structured and figure-defining designs of early 1950s European couture."}, "work": {"id": 122396, "title": "Tilly Dunnage's (Kate Winslet) black and bronze dress from The Dressmaker", "slug": "black-and-bronze-dress-worn-by-tilly-dunnage-kate-winslet", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN194728_Dressmaker_BlankAndBronzeDress.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61855]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:35:13.366196+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:35:13.366226+11:00"}

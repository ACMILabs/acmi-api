The Goa-Gunggari, Wakka Wakka, Murri filmmaker adapted her own stage play and novel (seen here), which reckons with colonialism’s impact on First Peoples and Country. As mist rolls across the landscape, Country whispers hauntingly to Molly (Purcell), guiding her toward a hidden truth. At other times, the terrain is framed as if it’s watching over her.\r\n\r\nThese shoes are also connected to Country. Yaegl filmmaker and writer Pauline Clague has noted that when Molly takes in Yadaka (Rob Collins), the Aboriginal fugitive is swift on his bare feet. When he puts on the shoes – a colonial symbol – he’s discovered by white men, having lost his grounding to Country."}, "work": {"id": 121876, "title": "The Drover's Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson", "slug": "the-drovers-wife-the-legend-of-molly-johnson", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P192796_LeahDirecting.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61335]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:44:50.501368+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:44:50.501421+11:00"}

This deep dive takes viewers through the processes that sustain all life, as air travels from the mouth into the lungs, whirling like a tornado, before circulating around the complex rivers and tributaries of our cardiovascular system. As this life force reaches the outer extremities, from the billowing synapses of the brain to our fingers and toes, the interior blooms into a forest of branching pathways, suffused by a fog of life-bringing oxygen. Through this transcendental narrative, it becomes clear that breath not only sparks life, but also connects us to the natural world through the cycle of respiration.\r\n\r\nAt ACMI, <i>Evolver</i> is presented in its original VR form and as three individual moments, including a <i>Evolver: Deep Listening Meditation</i>, a collective meditation experience to attune visitors to the rhythm of the life, and awe-inspiring, large-scale projections, <i>The Journey of Breath</i> and <i>The Breathing Cell</i>."}, "work": {"id": 122485, "title": "Evolver: VR", "slug": "evolver-vr", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/snapshot_5614_17s.jpg", "animated_image_url": "", "has_video": true}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "2022", "labels": [61943]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:35:46.931315+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:35:46.931360+11:00"}

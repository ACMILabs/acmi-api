Their house is magically located at the doorstep of the desert, bush and coast – environments that represent where the show’s writers are from. And as locations in the first animated show made for Indigenous Australian kids by an Indigenous crew, these environments aren’t just settings for great stories – they reflect the different landscapes of the people the show was made for. To the show’s fans, Little J and Big Cuz live in the same place they do.\r\n\r\nThey also speak like them. Each season, Indigenous communities could choose an episode to have translated into their traditional language. Naturally, they typically picked episodes set in locations that represent their country."}, "work": {"id": 100652, "title": "Set design in Little J and Big Cuz", "slug": "set-design-in-little-j-and-big-cuz", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/snapshot_2122_24s.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Tony Thorne and Ned Lander Media Pty Ltd", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2017-2020", "labels": [40140]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:21:48.053978+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:21:48.054016+11:00"}

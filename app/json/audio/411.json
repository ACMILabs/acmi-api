Serial no. 24171.\n\nWritten by Chelsey O'Brien, curator, ACMI:\n\nThe RCA Victor Sound 16mm Camera was introduced in 1934, five years after Hollywood’s conversion to sound pictures. The RCA Sound camera was the world’s first 16mm sound on film camera and was marketed towards amateur film makers.\n\nThe RCA sound camera was capable of shooting one hundred feet of black and white film while recording synchronized sound of the same role, ideal for direct sound recording while filming. The soundtrack was recorded on the edge of the film by a beam of light from a small battery-operated lamp, reflected from a small mirror attached to a diaphragm vibrated by speech from the camera operator. The camera operator could speak commentary which was recorded as a variable area soundtrack along the edge of the film. This placement however meant that the microphone also recorded sound from the camera’s spring-loaded motor. Once film was developed it could be played back on RCA’s sound projector, released a few years earlier to project studio-made sound films.\n\nThe RCA sound camera is an important addition to the ACMI Collection as it articulates a vital and historically early technical leap in the amateur film market as well as the sound on film process. Furthermore, it is representative of what would have been used in Australia in late 19th Century.\n\nTechnical details: Cinecamera for 16mm film, 100 foot reels.

The RCA 16mm Sound Camera was the first of its kind made in the USA. There were only a few made, perhaps less then 40.

Exploring digital voyeurism and online cultures, \"Delusional World\" summoned audiences to our new online gallery to encounter a frenetic collision of Chinese mythology, sci-fi futures and live performance.\n\nThis mind-bending, hyper-pop performance was a unique, one-time event. It featured a contemporary dancer fitted with motion capture technology, who projected fantastical digital avatars of the artist that materialised as deranged deities, Manga-inspired mutants and cyborgs. Live-streamed from Chronus Art Centre in Shanghai, this experimental performance presented a darkly humorous virtual world where the audience and artist interacted through a live chat.\n\nACMI's Collection retains an archive of documentation and images of the performance\n\n[Source: ACMI webpage for Lu Yang Delusional world, last accessed 27/10/2020.

While DIY VR devices like Google Cardboard are now common, there was once a time when we needed to visit NASA to experience virtual reality. That time was 1985, when the space agency used VR to train pilots and astronauts. Their prototype used sensors to track the user’s movements so that the artificial reality they saw appeared and responded like real life. Google Cardboard looks less impressive, but its low cost and its ability to work with any smartphone make it possible for even non-astronauts to explore virtual worlds."}, "work": {"id": 99985, "title": "Google HD Cardboard 2.0", "slug": "viewer-google-cardboard", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO180799_GoogleCardboardViewer_34Open.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Google", "headline_credit": "United States, 2014", "labels": [39481]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:20:37.376809+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:20:37.376840+11:00"}

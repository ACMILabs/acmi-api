The London-based art collective illuminates the hidden forces surrounding us, revealing the sublime through sensory journeys beyond our everyday perception. In collaboration with artists, scientists, musicians, poets, programmers and many more makers, Marshmallow Laser Feast has been leaving a glittery slug trail of sensory experiences as they journey through the cosmos. Fusing architectural tools, contemporary imaging techniques and creative technologies, they sculpt spaces that lay dormant until animated by playful investigation.\r\n\r\nFrom the roots of a majestic Amazonian tree to the unseen branches of the body and the birth of galaxies, <i>Works of Nature</i> is a major immersive exhibition that explores the hypnotic rhythm that cultivates and connects all life – breath.\r\n\r\nAt a moment of unprecedented global uncertainty, Marshmallow Laser Feast uses technology to offer a new way to see ourselves and the natural world. By combining nature and science, Marshmallow Laser Feast reminds us that we’re just one species in a shared ecosystem and asks, what can we learn from nature to prepare for the future?"}, "work": {"id": 122478, "title": "Works of Nature", "slug": "works-of-nature", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/Screenshot_2023-11-16_at_4.29.58_pm.png", "animated_image_url": "", "has_video": true}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61936]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:16:32.429185+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:16:32.429214+11:00"}, {"id": 622, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_119618.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "Glass Cinema lantern slide with black edging tape.

In the 1970s, University of Southern California film students found the stock sound effect and used it in their student films. One of those students was Ben Burtt, who became sound editor on both the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Indiana Jones</i> franchises, and used the effect throughout each series. Other filmmakers noticed and incorporated it into their own sound design as a running industry in-joke.

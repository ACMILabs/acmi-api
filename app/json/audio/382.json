From 1856, he drew a series of caricatures for the <i>Illustrated Times</i>, informally known as 'Shadows'. Inspired by popular magic lantern slides of the period, each scene depicts a shadow cast by an individual to form a surprising, usually humorous shape to reveal something about their inner personality.\r\n\r\nThe series was eventually published as a book, <i>Shadow and Substance</i> (1860), with hand-coloured images matched with prose and poetry by Robert Brough, who Bennet had collaborated on the 1854 edition of <i>Punch and Judy</i>."}, "work": {"id": 100572, "title": "Optical Illusions", "slug": "optical-illusions", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FC180109_FC003.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40068]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:44:11.758309+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:44:11.758347+11:00"}

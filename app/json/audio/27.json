It goes back to the first film in 1888 with Louis Le Prince’s <i>Roundhay Garden Scene</i>, a silent short of his family at home that demonstrates how we’ve always seen ourselves, friends and family as interesting subjects.  \r\n\r\nAs advancements in technology led to more portable and affordable cameras, amateur filmmakers continued documenting their lives; capturing the everyday and extraordinary moments that moved and made us long before we were sharing selfies.

It’s no surprise, considering he enchanted people as an illusionist before devising many special effects and film techniques. At the turn of the 21st century he created seamless screen illusions through in-camera tricks like multiple exposures, split-screens, time-lapse photography, dissolves and hand-colouring. He even accidentally invented the jump cut when his camera jammed.\r\n\r\nBetween 1896 and 1913, Méliès directed over 500 films. He described them as “little abracadabras” and they were truly magical, inviting audiences on <i>A Trip to the Moon</i> (1902), into <i>The Kingdom of Fairies</i> (1903) and to enjoy a chorus of decapitated heads."}, "work": {"id": 100601, "title": "Georges Méliès in Un homme de têtes (The Four Troublesome Heads)", "slug": "georges-melies-in-un-homme-de-tetes-the-four-troublesome-heads", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180321_G029.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, 1898", "labels": [40094]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:19:01.488743+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:19:01.488774+11:00"}

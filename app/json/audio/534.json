It is a huge clock, hundreds of feet tall, designed to tick for 10,000 years. The mountain in which the clock resides is privately owned by Jeff Bezos. Programmed never to chime the same melody twice, its anyone’s guess how many beautiful songs will never be heard over the clock’s 10 millennial lifespan. Xanthe Dobbie’s new experimental desktop performance ponders the human urge to seek immortality. Featuring original epic hero Gilgamesh and the disembodied deep fake voice of Alan Rickman, The Long Now collapses histories, illuminating ancient and contemporary myth-making practices."}, "work": {"id": 120329, "title": "The Long Now", "slug": "the-long-now", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Long_Now_2.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Xanthe Dobbie", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2022", "labels": [59794]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:50:34.647293+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:50:34.647322+11:00"}

Then the scene shifts to a bustle of passengers boarding a large airplane, their suitcases in tow. As we move closer, we can spot a man and a woman making their way up the airplane steps.\n\nNext, we observe a man positioned next to the airplane on the runway, with the gigantic aircraft itself towering behind him — its silent might a testament to human ingenuity. As our viewpoint draws back, we further absorb the panorama of the airplane parked on the tarmac, nestled under a cloudy sky.\n\nFinally, our tableau transitions to an intriguing portrait of a man and a woman standing beside a regal horse. More individuals gather around this majestic creature, gripping our curiosity as we ponder over their story.\n\nA crowd of people surrounds a horse, soon revealing a picture of the horse alongside its foal in a field. The same scene also includes a woman and two children standing near the horses. Moments later, a man and a boy join in, feeding the horse. The backdrop is a serene field enclosed by a fence, where a family gathers. In this gathering, a little girl is highlighted. Clad in a pink dress and white shoes, she's seen holding a toy - a teddy bear, which she delights in playing with.\n"}, "work": null, "created": "2023-10-23T10:15:01.824165+11:00", "updated": "2023-10-23T10:15:01.824195+11:00"}, {"id": 4, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/video_1820.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "Our video starts with a white clock on a black background, quickly moving on to show two women and a dog next to a car.

At its centre is The Adventures of Dolly, a playable game made with Wiradjuri and Ngiyampaa illustrator Charlotte Allingham. Take the controls and take Dolly on a journey through an alternate reality or not-so-distant future of Melbourne’s CBD, featuring iconic trams and Swanston Street.Growing up, videogame protagonists weren’t relatable to Jarra.\n\nThis work remedies that, giving First Peoples a chance to see ourselves imagined in a videogame – made for us, by us. Through The Adventures of Dolly, custom possum and wallaby spirit flooring and the hand-carved arcade cabinet, Jarra reclaims a place that hasn’t reflected our experiences. She brings Indigenous stories into gaming, inspiring the next generation and giving us power to determine our own futures."}, "work": {"id": 121855, "title": "More Than Just a Game", "slug": "more-than-just-a-game", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000201_ArcadePromo.PNG.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Jarra Karalinar Steel", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2022", "labels": [61314]}, "created": "2023-09-04T18:09:38.607207+10:00", "updated": "2023-09-04T18:09:38.607259+10:00"}]}

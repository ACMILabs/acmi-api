It’s a similar approach to how she has curated these cabinets of curios and memorabilia. Like the details of a costume, when presented together as a collection these objects become more than the sum of their parts. According to Kurzer, “each of the objects have a story to tell, brought together by the common denominator of the moving image”.\r\nWithin the cabinets, examples such as the Pez collection or the character figurines celebrate familiar film and TV characters that have escaped the frame and live on as part of our collective memory. Kurzer also acknowledges the behind-the-scenes roles of various creative departments in film and television production through the display of everyday items that are commonly used – a paintbrush, a pair of scissors or a handy wire coat hanger.\r\nIn collecting, creating and curating these objects for display, Kurzer adheres to her rule of avoiding the obvious and celebrating the unexpected.\r\nYou can see examples of Edie Kurzer’s costume work in <I>The Story of the Moving Image</i>."}, "work": {"id": 113719, "title": "CURIOUS", "slug": "edie-kurzer-design-materials", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183493_Cameras_FSF1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Edie Kurzer", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [53213]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:50:52.878274+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:50:52.878304+11:00"}

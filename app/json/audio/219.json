Dressed in simple draped fabrics, Gorr the God Butcher’s outfit doesn’t offer any hints about his mysterious backstory – but the contrast does mark him visually as the film’s antagonist.\r\n\r\nCreature and prosthetics designer Adam Johansen had the challenge of designing the prosthetics for Gorr, balancing simplicity with monstrosity. “Gorr is completely grey with multiple colours within that grey,” Johansen said. “For his monster look, we covered up his eyebrows and gave him heavier brows, teeth, full nails, veining and scarification. I’d go in and give him black goo to knock out all the pinks in his mouth and on his tongue.”"}, "work": {"id": 120366, "title": "Gorr the God Butcher costume and sword", "slug": "gorr-the-god-butcher-costume-and-sword", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59831]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:21:37.476258+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:21:37.476289+11:00"}

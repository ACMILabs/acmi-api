Then the scene shifts to a bustle of passengers boarding a large airplane, their suitcases in tow. As we move closer, we can spot a man and a woman making their way up the airplane steps.\n\nNext, we observe a man positioned next to the airplane on the runway, with the gigantic aircraft itself towering behind him â€” its silent might a testament to human ingenuity. As our viewpoint draws back, we further absorb the panorama of the airplane parked on the tarmac, nestled under a cloudy sky.\n\nFinally, our tableau transitions to an intriguing portrait of a man and a woman standing beside a regal horse. More individuals gather around this majestic creature, gripping our curiosity as we ponder over their story.\n\nA crowd of people surrounds a horse, soon revealing a picture of the horse alongside its foal in a field. The same scene also includes a woman and two children standing near the horses. Moments later, a man and a boy join in, feeding the horse. The backdrop is a serene field enclosed by a fence, where a family gathers. In this gathering, a little girl is highlighted. Clad in a pink dress and white shoes, she's seen holding a toy - a teddy bear, which she delights in playing with.\n"}, "work": null, "created": "2023-10-23T10:15:01.824165+11:00", "updated": "2023-10-23T10:15:01.824195+11:00"}

It is of unusual configuration - possibly for scientific use - having twin objectives (one behind the other) and bearing a maker's plate for Reynolds and Branson of Leeds who were well known for their science lanterns.  The detachable front objective has a focal length of 14\" and bears the trademark for John Wrench of London.  There would appear to be multiple options for image adjustment, with the lamp housing and lens assembly capable of sliding backwards and forwards, and rack and pinion arrangement allowing fine adjustment for the objective lenses.  Overall length 59cm (excluding rear curtain) and 27cm high."}, "work": {"id": 121948, "title": "Magic lantern projector with curtain", "slug": "magic-lantern-projector-with-curtain", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO190921_MagicLanternProjectorWithCurtain_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Reynolds & Branson Ltd.", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, c. 1890", "labels": [61407]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:25:35.089637+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:25:35.089667+11:00"}

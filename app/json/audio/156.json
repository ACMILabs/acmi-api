She turned her home into a DIY animation studio and pioneered animating silhouettes by shooting homemade puppets frame-by-frame against sheets of lead.\r\n\r\nLater she used layers of glass to create depth, devising the first multiplane camera, which she used to create the first colour animated feature film, <i>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</i> (1926). While many people believe Walt Disney’s <i>Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs</i> (1937) was the first animated feature, Reiniger’s fairytale precedes the Disney film by over a decade. With more than 60 animated films to her name, Lotte Reiniger is a true hero of animation."}, "work": {"id": 100855, "title": "Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed)", "slug": "die-abenteuer-des-prinzen-achmed-the-adventures-of-prince-achmed", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/BPAM0X.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Lotte Reiniger", "headline_credit": "Germany, 1926", "labels": [40343]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:54:30.173745+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:54:30.173783+11:00"}

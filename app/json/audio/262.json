Over the course of the show, they created glowing cabbage patch babies, dragons and ghosts (to name just a few!), grounding the freaky stories in a physical authenticity.\r\n\r\nAnd thereâ€™s nothing more freaky than creepy dolls. The ones displayed here appeared in the episode \"Toy Love\". The Viking Book of Love prop also appeared in that episode and others, showing the importance of props as narrative threads throughout screen stories. In a world of CGI, these objects recall a time when screen stories were told with a mixture of physical creativity and ingenuity."}, "work": {"id": 121950, "title": "Round the Twist props", "slug": "it-took-a-big-team-to-create-the-outrageous-props-and-visual-effects-in-round-the-twist-over-the-course-of-the-show-they-created-glowing-cabbage-patch-babies-dragons-and-ghosts-to-name-just-a-few", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN193096.tif.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61409]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:04:34.835353+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:04:34.835384+11:00"}

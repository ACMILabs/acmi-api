Once the technology was discovered, it only took five years for it to be available to amateur filmmakers.\r\n\r\nIn 1935, the world's first sound-on-film camera was released for the amateur market, the RCA Victor Sound 16mm camera. Like RCA's Photophone system, it recorded sound directly onto the film's edge via light reflected off a mirror, which was attached to a diaphragm that vibrated when the operator spoke."}, "work": {"id": 100526, "title": "Early sound recording equipment", "slug": "early-sound-recording-equipment", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000219_Nagra42ProfessionalAudioRecorder_34closed.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40022]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:02:48.023676+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:02:48.023706+11:00"}

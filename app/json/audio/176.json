He created gradual transitions and dissolves between scenes and perfected cross-cutting to show simultaneous action.\r\n\r\nIn <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> (1903), Porter cross-cut 10 different locations to show multiple, interlinked scenes in an 11-minute spectacle unlike anything seen on-screen before. Featuring villainous bandits, heroic lawmakers and innocent bystanders, the film was action-packed, and Porter’s editing mastery propelled the excitement to the final iconic scene – a bandit firing point-blank at the startled audience. Later, Porter pioneered changing shots in a single scene, and he’s even credited with identifying the ‘shot’ as the basic unit of a film."}, "work": {"id": 100603, "title": "Edwin S Porter", "slug": "edwin-s-porter", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180322_G030.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "United States, c. 1901", "labels": [40095]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:04:50.468828+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:04:50.468859+11:00"}

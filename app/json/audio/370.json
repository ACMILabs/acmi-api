During the glory days of Technicolor’s three-strip process, between 1934 and 1955, she was the colour supervisor on over 400 films, including <I>The Wizard of Oz</i> (1939) and <I>Gone with the Wind</i> (1939).\r\n\r\nAfter seeing filmmakers use the earlier two-strip Technicolor process to produce “unnatural and disastrous results”, she urged filmmakers to employ “colour restraint”. Kalmus believed that colour theories used in paintings could also be used in film and encouraged filmmakers to carefully consider which colours would convey a story’s emotions and themes."}, "work": {"id": 100238, "title": "Natalie Kalmus", "slug": "graphic-natalie-kalmus-technicolor-pioneer", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180331_G039.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [39734]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:38:42.331295+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:38:42.331328+11:00"}

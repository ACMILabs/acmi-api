For centuries these puppets have danced across screens and told stories, teaching philosophical, moral and aesthetic values through indigenous myths, ancient Indian epics and local legends.\r\n\r\nIntricately perforated and elaborately painted, these puppets are made from leather, bamboo and ox horn, and they cast dazzling shadows when silhouetted against walls or translucent cloths. The dalang, or puppeteer, uses rods to bring the characters to life in performances that are often accompanied by chanting, singing and gamelan.\r\n\r\nIn China, shadow plays have been popular for more than 2,000 years. Invented to entertain Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, shadow plays were transported to Europe by travellers in the mid-18th century. There they were known as <i>ombres chinoises</i> (Chinese shadows) and were adapted to tell European stories. Puppeteer François Dominique Séraphin made them popular when he presented them in Paris in 1776, and by 1781 he was dazzling the court at the Palace of Versailles. Even Marie Antoinette admired his work.\r\n\r\nShadow play sets like the Grand Théâtre Fantasmagorique used decorative paper puppets to cast short fables and fairytales. Later they were merged with other innovations, like magic lanterns, to project ghoulish phantasmagoria shows."}, "work": {"id": 117935, "title": "Shadow puppetry and play", "slug": "shadow-puppetry-and-play", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO178586_left.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [57430]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:23:11.403650+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:23:11.403681+11:00"}, {"id": 462, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_100874.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "The discovery of fire not only banished the darkness and provided warmth to our ancestors, it also allowed them to shape their imagination by projecting shadows.  \r\n\r\nRelive the origins of the moving image by casting your own shadow as it bends, towers and twists to craft imagined worlds, wonderous characters and incredible tales in this interactive experience that unites ancient storytelling techniques with modern technology."}, "work": {"id": 100874, "title": "Shadow Play [interactive]", "slug": "shadow-play-interactive", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Gareth_Sobey_SOMI_LowRes_14.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Grumpy Sailor", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [40362]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:22:05.976259+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:22:05.976289+11:00"}, {"id": 461, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_100652.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "There’s a world of adventure over Little J and Big Cuz’s back fence.

Turner (1775–1851) has been called the ‘painter of light’. He developed new artistic techniques to capture natural phenomena, evoking the intensity and transience of light.\r\n\r\nTurner’s works were simultaneously intuitive and scientific. He drew on the colour theories of German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who argued that every colour was a unique combination of light and dark. Goethe’s ideas influenced Turner's painting as well as his teaching. For his students, he prepared diagrams showing the reflection and refraction of rays of light and the production of shadows. His approach enabled him to capture visual sensations that had never been reproduced in visual art before. In the companion paintings shown in this room – Light and Colour (Goethe’s Theory)... and Shade and Darkness... – Turner opposes cool and warm colours and light and dark to capture fleeting atmospheric effects and explore contrasting emotional associations.\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/tate-etc/issue-32-autumn-2014/light-jmw-turner\">Discover how Turner has influenced a range of cinematographers, filmmakers and artists working with film over the decades in this article from Tate</a>.</b>\r\n\r\n科学之光\r\n\r\n英国画家约瑟夫·马洛德·威廉·透纳（1775—1851）被誉为“光之画家”。他发展了新的艺术技法来捕捉自然现象，展现光的强度和稍纵即逝。\r\n\r\n透纳的作品兼具直觉性和科学性。他借鉴了德国作家约翰·沃尔夫冈·冯·歌德的色彩理论。歌德认为，每一种色彩都是明与暗的独特组合。歌德的思想影响了透纳的绘画，也影响了他的教学。透纳为学生准备了图解，演示光线的反射、折射和阴影的产生。他的方法使他能够捕捉到以前从未在视觉艺术中被表达的视觉感受。此展厅内展出了一组画作——《光与色<歌德理论>…》与《阴霾与黑暗…》，透纳利用冷暖色彩、明暗对比，试图捕捉光稍纵即逝的气氛效果，探索形成鲜明对比的情感联想。"}, "work": {"id": 120213, "title": "Scientific Light", "slug": "scientific-light", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/D17147_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59678]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:20:35.973528+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:20:35.973592+11:00"}, {"id": 456, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_122501.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "As an artist collective, Marshmallow Laser Feast seeks to find emotional resonance in scientific stories – stories that connect us to the more-than-human world.

He began teaching at the Bauhaus, an avant-garde art school in Germany, in 1923. His influence reached far beyond Germany to include artists like György Kepes’ (1906–2001) and Luigi Veronesi (1908–1998), whose photographic work focused primarily on darkroom experiments and abstract imagery. Moholy-Nagy’s fellow teacher at the Bauhaus, Josef Albers (1888–1976), taught his students not to use shading, but pure lines, arguing that colour is relative to the viewer’s perception. The images they made investigate how light reflects, refracts and scatters in response to different objects.\r\n\r\nThese ideas spread as artists around the world experimented and thought about light through the medium of photography. Moholy-Nagy celebrated photography’s ability to transform the appearance of reality – whether structure or texture – into pure light phenomena. This approach is reflected in the emphasis on light and shadow in experimental photography during this time.\r\n\r\n光之学院派\r\n\r\n匈牙利艺术家拉斯洛·莫霍利-纳吉（1895–1946)）称赞摄影和电影为艺术引入了新的“光文化”。\r\n\r\n莫霍利-纳吉认为摄影实验甚至超越了绘画中最具创新性的方面。1923年，他被聘为德国包豪斯艺术学院的教授。他的影响力远不止于德国，乔治·凯普斯（1906-2001）和路易吉·维洛内西\r\n（1908-1998）等艺术家深受其影响，他们的摄影作品主要聚焦暗室实验和抽象意象。正如莫霍利-纳吉在包豪斯的同事约瑟夫·阿尔伯斯(1888-1976)那样，他教导学生运用纯线条而不是阴影。他认为，颜色与观者的感知相关。他们创作的图像研究了光线如何在不同的物体上反射、折射和散射。\r\n\r\n随着世界各地的艺术家通过摄影媒介对光进行实验和思考，这些理论逐渐传播开来。莫霍利-纳吉赞扬了摄影将现实表象（结构或是纹理）转化为纯粹光现象的能力。这种方法体现在这一时期实验摄影对光影的强调上。"}, "work": {"id": 120261, "title": "School of Light", "slug": "school-of-light", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/mohnagligplablawhi002.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59726]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:17:24.145999+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:17:24.146031+11:00"}, {"id": 454, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_122494.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "<i>Marshmallow Laser Feast</i> invites you to experience the formation of a black hole with their immersive artwork, <i>Distortions in Spacetime</i>. \r\nIn a giant star's final moments, atoms compress to a point where density becomes infinite, time stretches to a stop and the gravitational field is so strong that not even light can escape: a black hole. \r\nBut the force that creates this dark shadow also spews out a supernova explosion of matter that can eventually coalesce to form planets, plants and people.

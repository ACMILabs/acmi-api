Cascade Films’ <i>Malcolm</i> (1986) follows a shy man (Colin Friels) with a genius for invention. After being sacked from the tram depot for building his own locomotive, he meets Judy (Lindy Davies) and Frank (John Hargreaves), two would-be bank robbers. The trio use Malcolm’s gadgets to pull off the heist of the century, forming an unlikely family in the process.\r\n\r\nThe first film from director/writer duo Nadia Tass and David Parker, <i>Malcolm</i> was followed by many more films by the pair, including <i>Rikky and Pete</i> (1988), <i>The Big Steal</i> (1990), and <i>Amy</i> (1997).\r\n\r\nMalcolm won eight AFI awards and received international acclaim."}, "work": {"id": 121902, "title": "Malcolm", "slug": "malcolm", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P192782_MALCOLM035.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61361]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:29:43.171787+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:29:43.171818+11:00"}

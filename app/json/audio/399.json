The time frame of the series is limited, and costumes recur in flashbacks and memories throughout the show. As a result, we can see that each costume was designed to be worn in several ways. Here, we see that the bright burgundy exterior of Mrs Appleyard’s (Natalie Dormer) dress, which she wears in the infamous Valentine’s Day photo, gives way to a dark underskirt and shirt, with the suggestion that it can be worn with a sunhat and sunglasses in less formal scenes."}, "work": {"id": 120109, "title": "Picnic at Hanging Rock (2018) burgundy Valentine’s Day dress and picnic dresses design materials", "slug": "picnic-at-hanging-rock-2018-burgundy-valentines-day-dress-and-picnic-dresses-design-materials", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P189996_IrmaPicnicContinuity.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Edie Kurzer", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2017", "labels": [59574]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:49:19.315792+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:49:19.315856+11:00"}

All of these elements were on show in his epic 1914 film, <i>Cabiria</i>. The film broke new artistic ground by using special effects to re-create the eruption of Mount Etna and the naval battle of Syracuse, but its biggest legacy is the ‘Cabiria’ shot: the tracking shot. Pastrone mounted a camera on a dolly to trail the action in a scene, and this new technique was quickly adopted by filmmakers at the time."}, "work": {"id": 100609, "title": "Giovanni Pastrone", "slug": "giovanni-pastrone", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180325_G033.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40098]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:19:30.264367+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:19:30.264400+11:00"}

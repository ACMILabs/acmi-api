From soaring scores performed by live orchestras to phonograph recordings, filmmakers were constantly searching for new ways to incorporate sound into the moving image. Studios began to create cue sheets that charted the major moments of a motion picture, along with what kind of audio accompaniment was recommended to match the action on screen. In Japan live musical accompaniment was complemented by benshi performers, who would provide live narration during a screening and helped silent films endure long after synchronised sound was introduced."}, "work": {"id": 100584, "title": "Music cue sheets", "slug": "music-cue-sheets", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180370_G080.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40080]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:36:48.685459+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:36:48.685489+11:00"}

Strips of 35mm film featuring 14 stereo images were fed into the Tru-Vue, and a lever advanced the film and story. When held up to the light, the images appeared in 3D.\n\nIn 1951, Tru-Vue merged with the popular View-Master system, which used circular colour reels that brought tourist attractions and travel images to life in 3D. Some of the most popular View-Master reels included virtual tours of the newly built Disneyland, as well as stories featuring Mickey Mouse, Peter Pan and other popular Disney characters."}, "work": {"id": 100519, "title": "Tru-Vue and View-Master", "slug": "tru-vue-and-view-master", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/GROUP_ViewMasters.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40015]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:59:32.022084+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:59:32.022114+11:00"}

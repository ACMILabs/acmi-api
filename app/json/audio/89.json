In 1895 they succeeded, patenting the Cinématographe, which could record, develop and project film. The Lumière brothers’ all-in-one device was lightweight, portable and operated by hand crank instead of electricity. But its biggest achievement was projection: while only one person could look through the Kinetograph’s peephole at a time, audiences could watch Cinématographe films together.\r\n\r\nAlongside their invention, the Lumière brothers premiered 10 short films on daily life, known as actualités, including the famous <i>Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat</i> (1896). The Cinématographe even inspired the new art form’s name: cinema."}, "work": {"id": 100597, "title": "Auguste and Louis Lumière", "slug": "auguste-and-louis-lumiere", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180319_G027.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1895", "labels": [40092]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:31:40.826024+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:31:40.826054+11:00"}

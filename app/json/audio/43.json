This was an incredibly exciting era, when fashion houses such as Dior, Chanel and Balenciaga developed their signature styles. Dior’s designs used padding, pleats, boned corsetry and stiffened linings to emphasise the female form. Balenciaga was better known for his skill in drapery, and for his experimentation with new fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe costumes in <i>The Dressmaker</i> demonstrate remarkable accuracy in every aspect of their design and construction. Marion Boyce and Margot Wilson won Best Costume Design in the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards in 2015 for their outstanding work on The Dressmaker. Boyce was the primary costume designer, creating hundreds of costumes for the cast, while Wilson exclusively designed the costumes worn by Kate Winslet."}, "work": {"id": 122344, "title": "1950s Parisian couture", "slug": "1950s-parisian-couture", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61803]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:16:28.128507+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:16:28.128540+11:00"}

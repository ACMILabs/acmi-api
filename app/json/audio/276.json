It was one of the first times we saw stories of our people explored and it's lauded for its representation of <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2016/02/17/beck-cole-jedda-lens-50s-white-australia\">\"so many Aboriginal men and women, girls and boys on the screen\"</a>. But despite being a first for First Peoples representation, <i>Jedda</i> also reflects a deeply problematic time in Australian history characterised by formal policies of assimilation and the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families by the government.</b>\r\n\r\nThe tale of an Aboriginal woman torn between her white upbringing and her heritage, <i>Jedda</i> is the first Australian-made colour feature and first Australian film nominated for the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or. It stars Arrernte actress Rosalie Kunoth-Monks (credited as Ngarla Kunoth) as Jedda and Tiwi actor Robert Tudawali as Marbuck. Due to the film's popularity, and a rising interest in Aboriginal 'kitsch' and culture, Kunoth-Monks and Jedda became entwined. But unlike Tudawali, who had other roles, Kunoth-Monks never acted again and became an advocate for First Peoples in Australia."}, "work": {"id": 107712, "title": "Jedda", "slug": "jedda", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183283_Jedda_videocapture.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Charles Chauvel", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1955", "labels": [47205]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:09:35.537925+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:09:35.537968+11:00"}

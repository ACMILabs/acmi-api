Invented in 1906 by film pioneer George Albert Smith, it achieved the illusion of colour by capturing and projecting black-and-white film through alternating red and green filters. The first Kinemacolor motion picture ever filmed was <I>A Visit to the Seaside</i> (1908), and the first public screenings were held in London a year later. During the height of its popularity, more than 260 films were made with Kinemacolor and exhibited across Europe and the United States in over 250 venues."}, "work": {"id": 100582, "title": "Kinemacolor", "slug": "kinemacolor", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FC180163_FC057.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40078]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:10:06.540604+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:10:06.540634+11:00"}

At first, actors, studios and journalists resisted the new technology, and some even called it the “Talkie Terror”. Though the first experiments began in the 1890s, it wasn’t until <i>Don Juan</i> in 1926 that a score and sound effects perfectly matched a movie, thanks to Warner Bros.’ Vitaphone system. <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (1927) went one step further, featuring not only synced music and sound effects but also the first recorded dialogue. Walt Disney was so impressed with the possibilities, he was inspired to create his own talking picture, <i>Steamboat Willie</i> (1928), which was not only one of the first cartoons with synchronised sound, it introduced the world to Mickey Mouse."}, "work": {"id": 99921, "title": "Arrival of sound", "slug": "arrival-of-sound-supercut", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/181533_ArrivalofSound_videocapture2.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [39416]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:30:44.261858+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:30:44.261888+11:00"}

This fired his imagination; he would make images with ink on strips of cellophane and project these through the Magic Lantern by means of a candle onto an old sheet draped on the wall.  The result was disappointing but encouraging.  The one candle did not provide sufficient light especially during daylight.  Little did he realise that he had opened a door on a world of projecting images on large screens.  He had abandoned merry-go-rounds and wind mills but this was different.  He never let go of his Magic Lantern; it could well have been dubbed his lighthouse showing him the way to go.  What happened to his Magic Lantern?  After his death in 2014 it was found among his belongings and was donated to the Australian Centre for Moving Image (ACMI) which superseded the State Film Centre, where Edwin spent most of his working life.\" (text from book - 'Life with a Purpose, Conversations with Edwin James Schefferle - Scheff')"}, "work": {"id": 99499, "title": "Child's toy tin magic lantern with candle projection", "slug": "the-empire-magic-lantern", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000271_MagicLantern_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "The Empire Magic Lantern Outfit", "headline_credit": "Germany, c. 1900", "labels": [38994]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:44:26.264485+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:44:26.264517+11:00"}

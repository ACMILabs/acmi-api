His meticulous depiction of sunlight on the sea built on ideas promoted by the Pre-Raphaelites earlier in the century.\r\n\r\nWith the group of French artists known as Impressionists, light became a subject in itself. Claude Monet (1840–1926), Camille Pissarro (1830–1930), Alfred Sisley (1839–1899) and others ventured into the countryside to paint outdoors. These artists worked in nature to record the fleeting effects of light, atmosphere and movement, finishing their works outside. This was very unusual at a time when most landscape artists just made sketches and returned to their studios to develop them into carefully finished works. The Impressionists broke from illusionistic traditions, emphasising the paint on the surface of the canvas, flattening perspective and cropping their compositions in striking ways.\r\n\r\n光之印象\r\n\r\n19世纪末的欧洲，许多艺术家重新将目光聚焦到自然世界，作为对飞速发展的技术变革与社会变化的回应。\r\n\r\n约翰·布雷特（1831—1902）等艺术家捕捉光的效果及其情感特质。他对海面上阳光的细致描绘，建立在19世纪初期拉斐尔前派所倡导的思想基础之上。\r\n\r\n在法国印象派艺术家群体中，光线本身就是一个主题。克劳德·莫奈（1840—1926）、卡米耶·毕沙罗（1830—1930）、阿尔弗雷德·西斯莱（1839—1899）等人前往乡间探索，并进行户外绘画。这些艺术家在大自然中创作，记录光线、气氛和运动的转瞬即逝效果，在室外完成他们的创作。这在当时非比寻常，因为大多数风景画家只在户外绘制草图，然后再回到工作室将其精雕细琢成完整的作品。印象派艺术家打破了透视传统，强调画布表面的颜料、扁平化的视角和经剪裁的构图，令人惊叹。"}, "work": {"id": 120252, "title": "Light Impressions", "slug": "light-impressions", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/N05833_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59717]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:17:04.780489+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:17:04.780523+11:00"}, {"id": 295, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_120283.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "The works in this section use colour in different ways to create impressions of light and movement.\r\n\r\nWassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) wanted his art to go beyond straightforward representation, giving viewers a more participatory experience, like listening to music. He aimed to create a sense of movement in his work and saw colour as an essential tool in this. These same principles can be seen the work of Bridget Riley (born 1931), who uses geometric shapes and colour to explore the nature of perception. Riley describes her use of different tones as a change ‘tempo’, pitching shades of colour ‘against the structure of the formal movement’. Nataraja 1993 refers to the Hindu god Shiva, who is usually depicted with many arms in his form as the cosmic dancer.\r\n\r\nCombining projected light with a painted surface, Peter Sedgley (born 1930) creates the illusion of movement on the canvas. A series of spray-painted concentric circles of different colours are arranged to present a visual diaphragm capable of the most radical colour changes. Sedgley sees these adjustments in colour to be akin to tuning a musical instrument.\r\n\r\n光与色\r\n\r\n这个展厅中的作品以不同的方式运用色彩来创造出光与运动的印象。\r\n\r\n瓦西里·康定斯基（1866—1944）希望他的艺术能够超越直截了当的再现，给观者更多的参与性体验，如同聆听音乐一般。他的目标是在作品中创造出一种运动感，并将色彩视为其中必不可少的工具。这些相同的原理在布里奇特·莱利（1931—）的作品中也有所体现，她用几何形状和色彩来探索感知的本质。莱利将她对不同色调的运用描述为一种“节奏”的变化，将色彩的深浅“与形式运动的结构相对应”。创作于1993年的《娜塔罗迦》指的是印度教中的湿婆神，通常被描绘成有许多手臂的“宇宙舞者”。\r\n\r\n彼得·塞奇利（1930—）将投射光与喷绘表面相结合，在画布上创造出运动的错觉。画布上喷绘着一系列不同颜色的同心圆，呈现出能够进行最极端色彩变化的视场光阑。塞奇利认为颜色的调节类似于为乐器调音。"}, "work": {"id": 120283, "title": "Light and Colour", "slug": "light-and-colour", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/T02344_P.JPG.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59748]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:15:15.315983+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:15:15.316012+11:00"}, {"id": 294, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_107525.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "Life Magazine cover featuring Edwin E.

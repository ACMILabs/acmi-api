Rather, he preferred to assert the ordinariness of light in his work. Many of his works refer to significant figures of 20th-century art. This sculpture is a homage to Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin (1885–1953). Flavin described it as a ‘monument’ partly as a joke, aware of the disparity between its modest materials and the traditional grandeur of monumental sculpture."}, "work": {"id": 120279, "title": "‘monument’ for V.

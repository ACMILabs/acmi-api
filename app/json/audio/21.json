Featuring thousands of photos, videos, campaign materials, media and manuscripts, it aims to reinterpret and reframe Australia’s Aboriginal political history.\r\n\r\nActivists of the era saw the power of film and television to tell truth, advocate for justice and resist oppression, as well as galvanise other First Peoples into action. Their involvement in films, documentaries and later, during the 1980s, television, inadvertently allowed activists to champion the rights of First Peoples while simultaneously increasing representation in screen culture."}, "work": {"id": 117972, "title": "Aboriginal History Archive", "slug": "aboriginal-history-archive", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180664.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [57467]}, "created": "2024-01-12T11:13:51.443569+11:00", "updated": "2024-01-12T12:16:16.366452+11:00"}

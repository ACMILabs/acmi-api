Kusama is interested in the behaviour of light when it bounces off a reflective surface, and what this does to our perception of space. Peering inside the cube, we see multiple reflections, giving the illusion of infinite space. The appearance of the sculptureâ€™s interior varies in relation to external conditions, such as the light levels in the room and the surrounding objects and colours, including other viewers engaging with the work."}, "work": {"id": 120251, "title": "The Passing Winter", "slug": "the-passing-winter", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/T12821_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Yayoi Kusama", "headline_credit": "2005", "labels": [59716]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:50:58.774611+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:50:58.774642+11:00"}

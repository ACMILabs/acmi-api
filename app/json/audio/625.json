For thousands of generations in Australia, First Peoples storytelling has harnessed the movement of the world and play of light: the special glow of sunset to catch the movement of dancing feet, the flickering campfire as tales are told in the night, the story of stars and constellations told in the Dreaming.\r\n\r\nIn this multi-part artwork Gunditjmara artist Vicki Couzens references how ochre markings on the body capture and reflect light during ceremony, creating a centuries-spanning connection between traditional First Peoples storytelling and the contemporary moving image.\r\n\r\n“<i>Where does moving image originate? Shadow and light, elemental movement and action; see figures in formation, ceremony in the circle, moving, in rhythm, in rhyme with the heartbeat, sunlight, moon shadow, Yanmeeyarr... flickering in firelight. Dancers painted and adorned, in corroboree, in ceremony, telling story through the dance. The viewer in movement and reflection becomes part of the dance, as the figures become animated. Yanmeeyarr, flickering in the firelight, is reflected in the present; the viewer and the new technologies of today, become part of the work and the ongoing past-present-future of our storytelling continuum.</i>” – Vicki Couzens\r\n\r\n<I>Yanmeeyarr</i> is generously supported by the Sidney Myer Fund"}, "work": {"id": 118030, "title": "Yanmeeyarr", "slug": "yanmeeyarr", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/VickiCouzensYanmeeyarr_2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Vicki Couzens", "headline_credit": "Gunditjmara Keerray Woorroong, 2020", "labels": [57532]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:17:36.726727+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:17:36.726759+11:00"}

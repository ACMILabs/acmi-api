Artists have been colouring films since films were invented. Itâ€™s estimated that about 80% of films made between the 1890s and the 1920s were coloured through tinting, toning, stencilling and hand-colouring. This work was done from the mid-1890s by colourists like Elisabeth Thuillier. Thuillier employed 200 women in her Paris workshop, where they worked on a production line and each painted one colour on a film. This process helped bring vibrancy and beauty to fluttering butterfly wings, hypnotic dances and much more."}, "work": {"id": 100614, "title": " Hand-coloured film", "slug": "hand-coloured-negatives", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180340_G048.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40102]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:12:48.413221+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:12:48.413252+11:00"}

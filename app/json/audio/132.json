These stories were used as the basis for the visionary dystopian sci-fi show <i>Cleverman</i>, which reimagined the Hairy people (known as ‘Hairies’ in the show) as heroes harassed and hunted by the government.   \r\n\r\nConcept creator Ryan Griffen and production designer Jacob Nash worked with Weta Workshop to transform their actors into these extraordinary characters. They sketched concepts to establish a visual style, and these sketches were then used to create costumes, wigs and prosthetics.   \r\n\r\nThe results are some of the most iconic characters to appear on an Australian TV show, which was already groundbreaking for exploring Aboriginal origin stories in a contemporary context while examining class, racism and power."}, "work": {"id": 100869, "title": "Cleverman character design", "slug": "cleverman-character-design", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180543_G253.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Ryan Griffen, Goalpost Pictures and Jacob Nash", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2016-2017", "labels": [40357]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:46:50.098021+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:46:50.098053+11:00"}

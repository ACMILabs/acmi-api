Not only does it draw on developer Naphtali Faulkner’s experience as a photographer but the government response to Black Summer – in Te Reo, Umurangi means ‘red sky’, a reference to the hellish atmosphere during the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIn the game’s futuristic Tauranga, neon lights illuminate rooftops and condemned housing districts, the walled-city streets bustle with partygoers and fighter jets fly overhead. Through the camera’s viewfinder, the player is given an intimate view of a city suffering through climate change, political apathy and over policing. By giving players the ability to change lenses and minutely edit images, they’re given a sense of agency over the chaos, with points earned for creatively capturing the environment rather than shooting enemies like most dystopian games."}, "work": {"id": 120411, "title": "Umurangi Generation", "slug": "umurangi-generation", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P190417_UmurangiGenerationCameraStrap.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [59876]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:01:03.571425+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:01:03.571455+11:00"}

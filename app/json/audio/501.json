Through eight households that span decades, <i>Unpacking</i> tells her life story without words, but through the domestic spaces the protagonist occupies.\r\n\r\nThis display explores how the menu flow is integral to Witch Beam Games’ earliest vision of <i>Unpacking</i>. Each save file is envisioned as a photo album, with each completed room recorded as a photo inside. This approach offers a nostalgic, familiar framing to the homes depicted in the game, seamlessly stitching together the disparate time periods that the game covers."}, "work": {"id": 120467, "title": "Storyboarding in Unpacking", "slug": "storyboarding-in-unpacking", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P190363_Animation_BoxFoldup.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2021", "labels": [59931]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:36:40.762519+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:36:40.762549+11:00"}

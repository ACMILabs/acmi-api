During a screening, the projectionist seamlessly changed film rolls between projectors, loading all ‘even’ reels on one projector and ‘odd’ reels on the other projector.\n\nThis one was used in the small town of Tumbarumba, nestled in the shadow of the Snowy Mountains. From around 1959 until 1965, it was operated by William James Burnell Newman, who ran Valley Theatres.

While early slides featured line etchings on glass plates, lanternists were soon hand-painting them to give projections vibrancy and depth.\r\n\r\nIn the 1820s, copperplate printing processes allowed an image to be stamped on glass. This led to mass slide production from the mid-1800s to the 1920s – particularly of toy slides, which were printed with decals and bordered with colourful edges to protect children’s hands.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of photography in the 1840s advanced things: photos printed on glass brought real-life scenes to life.

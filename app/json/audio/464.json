Vernon was definitely a triple threat, and his performance as Gingy in the pitch was so impressive that he voiced the fan-favourite character in the movie."}, "work": {"id": 100626, "title": "Shrek storyboard pitch", "slug": "shrek-storyboard-pitch", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180426_P180427_DreamWorksPitch.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "United States, 2015", "labels": [40114]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:23:46.002314+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:23:46.002345+11:00"}

Quickly, we're introduced to a poster from a young filmmaker's international film festival. Surprisingly, the year is 1944! This young filmmaker won the 'just for fun' second prize. As we continue, we find they're part of the 'Brighton Grammar Film Makers Club'. Two black and white pictures follow, one showing a festive gate sign in Mexico, and the other featuring an adorable dog by a worded fence.\n\nThe video begins to pan through black and white photos. First, there's a picture of a gate with the sign 'Stoyy Greeley'. Next, another image of a fence and a sign comes into view. This is followed quickly by another shot of a fence with a 'Fast Solution' sign. The video then shows another gate shot with a sign and a 'Do Not Enter' sign. A woman can be seen standing behind a fence in the subsequent picture, and later, a boy is seen with his dog in front of a fence. The boy, now alone, is then shown engrossed in a book. The final moments reveal photos of a building surrounded by a fence and a fenced area with a car parked in front.\n\nThe video shows various scenes: a man hangs from a tree near a wall, then shares a moment with a boy and another man.

An old image comes into focus, revealing an aged fence and bench before a house. This house emerges in reality, where a man is spotted strolling nearby. He stops to survey the area from a window and leans on a fence. He later kneels near the house's window, where inside, two curious boys peer out. Finally, there's another glimpse of a note held in someone's hand.\n\nIn this moving scene, we first see three boys engaged in conversation in an area that feels homely. The scene portrays historical imagery through a 1956 black and white photograph of these boys sitting on a bench. The narrative then diverts to two suited men in a 1940s backyard setting. We see these very characters daringly climbing a fence in front of a household. \n\nA noteworthy item is an old photo capturing a roller coaster in a park, instilling a sense of nostalgia in the viewer.

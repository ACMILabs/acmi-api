Enter the Commodore 64, a wildly popular 8-bit home computer console that was a major contributor to the home computer revolution. With over 17 million units sold worldwide, it was the highest selling single computer at the time and was often used to run educational resources and games. In Australia alone, over 700 games were produced for the Commodore 64. Software was originally released on audio cassette before 5 ¼ inch floppy discs (and later 3½ inch floppy discs) became more common during the 1980s, which we've worked to locate, acquire and preserve."}, "work": {"id": 113855, "title": "Commodore 64 console and cassettes", "slug": "mpl-display-group-commodore-64-console-and-cassettes", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/GROUP_E000320_E000283_E000284_Commodore64Display.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Commodore Business Machines", "headline_credit": "1985", "labels": [53349]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:47:31.933937+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:47:31.933969+11:00"}

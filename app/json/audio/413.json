The Praxinoscope Théâtre gave viewers the chance to mix a range of printed backgrounds and character reels to create more sophisticated animated scenes and stories.\n\nThe characters are illustrated on black backgrounds and reflected onto scenery – printed on a separate card – via the praxinoscope’s mirror drum.

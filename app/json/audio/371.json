The style was first released by Sony in 1967 and was an important development in camera technology, enabling a new level of portability with both the camera and recorder battery-powered and self-contained. It enabled videos to be captured and played back more quickly while also cutting down on the cost, which led to the birth of video art, guerrilla television and activism. In the 1970s, the Portapak was popular with video artists and alternative media collectives. In Australia, Open Channel and the Paddington Video Access Centre used Portapaks to create alternative broadcast channels, paving the way for community television."}, "work": {"id": 114497, "title": "National Portable Video Camera WV-3085", "slug": "national-portable-video-camera-wv-3085", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "National Panasonic", "headline_credit": "Japan, c. 1974", "labels": [53989]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:39:17.035692+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:39:17.035746+11:00"}

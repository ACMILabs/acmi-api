While early slides featured line etchings on glass plates, lanternists were soon hand-painting them to give projections vibrancy and depth.\r\n\r\nIn the 1820s, copperplate printing processes allowed an image to be stamped on glass. This led to mass slide production from the mid-1800s to the 1920s – particularly of toy slides, which were printed with decals and bordered with colourful edges to protect children’s hands.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of photography in the 1840s advanced things: photos printed on glass brought real-life scenes to life. But technology didn’t diminish the craftsmanship of lanternists, who still retouched worn slides by hand."}, "work": {"id": 100533, "title": "Magic lantern slides", "slug": "magic-lantern-slides", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/R0008024_AHWMLS_BlueAndGreyClaspingHands_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40029]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:27:45.197099+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:27:45.197129+11:00"}

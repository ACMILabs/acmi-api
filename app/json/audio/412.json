Emile Reynauld, Paris. Box opening and errecting to carry mirror drum with twelve facets; black background picture bands fit around circumference. Image viewed through hole in upright lid, seen through glass plate in which is reflected interchangeable background and foreground scene; the glass set in theatre style proscenium. Instructions pasted on lower proscenium panel.\n\nPraxinoscope theatre made by Charles-Emile Reynaud in France, 1879.\n\nReynaud’s 1877 Praxinoscope was similar to a zoetrope, with mirrors in place of viewing slits. As the wheel turned, the reflections of the pictures appeared stationary. This Praxinoscope theatre was a development of Reynaud’s earlier Praxinoscope. This version had a glass viewing screen which reflected one of a range of printed scenes placed below the viewing aperture on the inside of the lid. Looking through this aperture, the viewer sees the moving figure reflected on the mirror drum which appears to be superimposed on the printed scene.\""}, "work": {"id": 99481, "title": "Praxinoscope Théâtre", "slug": "reynauds-praxinoscope-theatre", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO177313_RaynaudPraxinoscopeTheatre_34_Left.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1889-1900", "labels": [38976]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:57:24.119152+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:57:24.119185+11:00"}

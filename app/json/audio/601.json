This video remixes footage found on the internet to critique its own bankrupt idealism, but other key #corecore targets include capitalism, overconsumption and inequality. Some highlight the loneliness and depression caused by our hyper-networked world, while others use scenes from films like <i>Joker</i> to project a distorted vision of masculinity. There's no precise definition. To some it's an artform for our age, to others it's just shitposting. Either way, the hashtag has over 400 million views."}, "work": {"id": 121928, "title": "Wake up", "slug": "wake-up", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/CotD_CoreCore.JPG.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Sebastian Valencia", "headline_credit": "04 JAN 2023", "labels": [61387]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:09:55.574058+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:09:55.574099+11:00"}

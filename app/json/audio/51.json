Arc lamps were commonly found in streetlamps during the 1870s, gradually replaced by incandescent light in the early 20th century. But in situations that called for a high-intensity light, like movie projectors, arc lamps still had a role.\r\n\r\nCarbon arc projectors were common until WWII, and it’s rare to see one as late as the 1950s. Because of the intensity of the light in these projectors, they were mostly used in large auditoriums, despite being designed as a lightweight travelling projector. They were marketed as the best bet for screening 16mm film in tents, at road shows, at fairs in rural areas and outdoors – as long as there was a power source!"}, "work": {"id": 99494, "title": "400 Porto-Arc 16mm projector", "slug": "rca-400-porto-arc-16mm-projector", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000272_RCA400PortoArc16mmProjector_Side.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "RCA", "headline_credit": "United States, c. 1953", "labels": [38989]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:19:35.983051+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:19:35.983083+11:00"}

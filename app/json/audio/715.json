Never fear though, <i>Beyond Thunderdome</i> still bristles with mind-boggling retro-fitted cars, hair-raising stunt work, bizarre costumes and intricate world building to make this third entry into the series as white-knuckled as its predecessors."}, "work": {"id": 113979, "title": "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome", "slug": "mad-max-beyond-thunderdome", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183636_MadMaxBeyondThunderdomePoster_TMDB.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "George Miller and George Ogilvie", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1985", "labels": [53473]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:43:29.359617+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:43:29.359649+11:00"}

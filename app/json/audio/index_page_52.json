Modern consoles often have built-in features that let users easily record their play to share online, but this video isn’t that. It looks like leaked footage of <i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i>’s new graphics, but it’s a real-world video mimicking the series' old-school movements, gestures and streetscapes. It’s like digital cosplay and reflects a larger trend of social users recreating game worlds in real life – like giving strangers quests as if in a fantasy game – which highlights the blurring of online and offline life. It’s been viewed over 40m times and endlessly shared."}, "work": {"id": 121793, "title": "GTA 6 in real life", "slug": "gta-6-in-real-life", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Catch_of_the_Day_GTA_in_real_life.JPG.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Ghetto Trio", "headline_credit": "United States, 29 SEP 2022", "labels": [61252]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:24:23.544770+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:24:23.544803+11:00"}, {"id": 232, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_121873.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "Since 2018, activist Greta Thunberg has used social media to bring young people into the climate change conversation. Primarily active on Twitter and Instagram, she has organised and documented schools striking for climate action, protests and sit-ins internationally – and recently sparred online with alt-right influencer Andrew Tate, a high profile exchange that was interrupted by his arrest on human trafficking charges. This video of her detainment at an anti-mining protest in Germany displays Thunberg’s staunchness, shot through with the audacity that makes her a compelling campaigner."}, "work": {"id": 121873,

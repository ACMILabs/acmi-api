Early filmmakers experimented with sound but couldn’t match it perfectly with motion pictures. The Vitaphone solved that, creating synchronised playback through a vinyl disc manually linked to a film projector. The system received wide-spread acclaim from its use in the first Vitaphone feature, <i>Don Juan</i> (1926), which featured a synced score from the New York Philharmonic and sound effects, and then a year later in <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, the first film to feature dialogue. Warner Brothers billed the Vitaphone as “the marvel of this marvellous age” and it certainly ushered in a new one: the success of <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>The Jazz Singer</i> signalled the end of silent cinema."}, "work": {"id": 100617, "title": "Vitaphone discs", "slug": "vitaphone-discs", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000269_VitaphoneDisc_TheVitaphoneCorporationCharles_Hackett392ReelThreeDate9-1TimesPlayed2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40105]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:09:11.532282+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:09:11.532324+11:00"}, {"id": 596, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_107479.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "(Tim Shiel) Glowing Pains: music from The Gardens Between, limited edition 12\" Vinyl"}, "work": {"id": 107479, "title": "Vinyl record of The Gardens Between soundtrack", "slug": "glowing-pains-music-from-the-gardens-between-12-vinyl", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180088_GardensBetween.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Tim Shiel", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2018", "labels": [46972]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:08:38.658184+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:08:38.658212+11:00"}, {"id": 595, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_99505.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "View Master Viewing Reels from Sawyer's, Inc.\nTitles below:\n1 - 5002 Sydney NSW\n2 - 1901 Windmill land south Holland\n3 - 5015 Ski Fields, Mt Kosciusko and Threadbo Valley, NSW\n4 - 1210 Highland scenes scotland\n5 - 5270 North Island New zealand\n6 - 1600-b Italy"}, "work": {"id": 99505, "title": "View Master\nviewing reels", "slug": "sawyers-view-master-viewing-reels", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P179116_SawyersViewMasterViewingReels.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Sawyer's Inc.", "headline_credit": "United States", "labels": [39000]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:08:34.689361+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:08:34.689390+11:00"}, {"id": 594, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_117948.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "The Vietnam War is known as ‘the television war’.

From the 1930s, the Wiradjuri and Yorta Yorta activist, artist and entrepreneur had roles in several Australian films, documented Aboriginal life through home movies and is likely one of the first Aboriginal filmmakers, with a recently discovered silent 1946 film credited to him.â€¯Through <i>Forgotten People</i> (1967) and <i>Alcheringa</i> (1962), Bill demonstrated his ongoing commitment to self-representation through screen culture. He helped establish the Aborigines Advancement League and campaigned for the 'YES' vote in the 1967 Referendum. Through his factory and shop, Aboriginal Enterprises, he shared his art and culture, selling boomerangs and other pieces."}, "work": {"id": 107707, "title": "Bill Onus", "slug": "bill-onus", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FC180211_FC105_Alcheringa_Film_Still_-_Bill_Onus.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [47200]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:33:55.088866+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:33:55.088898+11:00"}

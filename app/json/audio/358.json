Situated on pastoral land in the Murray and Mellee region of South Australia, Koomooloo Station operated as a sheep station from 1868 and in 1951, this projector was bought to entertain workers during the shearing season. Luckily it has a vent at the back of the casing to keep it cool because if it was used inside a shearing shed the heat wouldâ€™ve been insufferable."}, "work": {"id": 100293, "title": "Model 621 Sound Projector with tripod and stand", "slug": "bell-and-howell-gaumont-model-621-projector-and-model-601-speaker", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO178588_BellHowell16mmProjector_34Full.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Bell and Howell-Gaumont", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, c. 1940-1947", "labels": [39789]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:34:18.055962+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:34:18.055994+11:00"}

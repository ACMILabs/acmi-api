In each level, the pair must deliver a lantern to the peak of the island by solving time-warp puzzles.

The friends sail between memory islands in a floating treehouse – like seafarers of old, they are guided by the stars. Their memories together are bright points in an ocean of fog, guiding them as they learn to deal with change. \r\n\r\nPlayers don’t control the characters per se, but they instead use the game’s time-based mechanic to fast forwards or backwards.

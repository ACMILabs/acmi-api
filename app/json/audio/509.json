As Dorothy steps out of her dreary sepia life and into Munchkinland, she’s enveloped in glorious Technicolor. That kaleidoscope of highly saturated hues is actually produced from just three colours – red, green and blue – recorded on individual film strips and then dyed. This is the three-strip Technicolor process.\r\n\r\nBut Judy Garland wasn’t the first star of a Technicolor feature film. That triumph goes to Miriam Hopkins, who played the titular character in <i>Becky Sharp</i> (1935), the first feature to use the three-strip technique after its introduction in 1932. Technicolor was the most popular colouring system in Hollywood until the mid-1950s, when single-strip processes were developed."}, "work": {"id": 100583, "title": "Technicolor", "slug": "technicolor", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180332_G040.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40079]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:41:05.393301+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:41:05.393348+11:00"}

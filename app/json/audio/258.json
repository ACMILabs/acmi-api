William Rothenstein (1872–1945) was similarly concerned with portraying domestic environments. In his portraits of family and friends, he gives the surrounding spaces as much attention as the figures. Both artists took great care in accurately portraying light, from the highlights on the figures’ hair, skin and clothing in Rothenstein’s paintings to the effects of light and shadow on the walls and floor of Hammershøi’s home."}, "work": {"id": 120291, "title": "Interior", "slug": "interior", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/N04106_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Vilhelm Hammershøi", "headline_credit": "1899", "labels": [59756]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:00:34.967781+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:00:34.967809+11:00"}

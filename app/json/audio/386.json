During the 1920s and 30s in Sydney, McDonagh worked with her sisters Isabel and Phyllis to make some of the most acclaimed silent Australian films. Their first film, <i>Those Who Love</i> (1926), was funded by their family and hailed as a “dazzling triumph” by publication <i>Everyone’s</i>.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by Hollywood melodramas and German Expressionism, the sisters’ films featured emotionally honest characters and broke with traditional gender norms. Fox Films even offered McDonagh and her sisters the chance to make movies in Hollywood, but they decided they “would end up very small fish in a big pond” so stayed in Australia, where they worked up until the mid-1930s."}, "work": {"id": 100607, "title": "Paulette McDonagh on the set of The Cheaters", "slug": "paulette-mcdonagh-on-the-set-of-the-cheaters", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180324_G032.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1929", "labels": [40097]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:45:24.750523+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:45:24.750593+11:00"}

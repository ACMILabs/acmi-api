In <i>Apartment</i> (2021), we get an intimate view into game developer Kalonica’s own home, reconstructed from memory after she left to stay with her family for the duration of the COVID lockdowns.\r\n\r\nKalonica has reconstructed her apartment down to the last detail. Accompanied by a textured soundscape by Maize Wallin, the player is invited to interact with objects ranging from furniture and houseplants to personal photographs. Through touching these objects, we are privy to her memories and reflections on the home she had created for herself, and what it means to leave it behind.\r\n\r\n<i>Apartment</i> was commissioned by Freeplay Festival, through the Victoria Together Commissioning Program supported by Creative Victoria."}, "work": {"id": 122432, "title": "Apartment (2021)", "slug": "apartment-2021", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "labels": [61891]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:29:12.925076+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:29:12.925108+11:00"}

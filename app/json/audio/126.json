Boyce recognised the shared history of sadness and loss that connects Tilly and Marigold. The design of Marigold’s dress is a deliberate nod to the style of Madame Vionnet, who was Tilly’s mentor in Paris. This homage to her teacher is a personal tribute from Tilly to Marigold. The elegance of the extravagantly draped fabric gives Marigold her one and only moment of happiness in the film."}, "work": {"id": 122355, "title": "Marigold Pettyman's (Alison Whyte) chartreuse dress from The Dresskmaker", "slug": "chartreuse-slinky-jersey-dress-worn-by-marigold-pettyman-alison-whyte", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN194730_Dressmaker_ChartreuseSlinkyJersey.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61814]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:43:39.003810+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:43:39.003858+11:00"}

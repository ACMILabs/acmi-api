Both were wiped out when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE. Herculaneum is in the distance to the left, smothered with lava. Pompeii is laid out in more detail, closer to the foreground. Mount Vesuvius is shown in the early stages of the eruption, the glow of lava colouring the whole landscape a vivid red, while the sky appears to convulse with billowing ash clouds and lightning. A contemporary viewer remarked that Martin was less interested in showing the terror of his figures, than in ‘producing powerful contrasts by every reflection of light’."}, "work": {"id": 120222, "title": "The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum", "slug": "the-destruction-of-pompeii-and-herculaneum", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/N00793_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "John Martin", "headline_credit": "1822", "labels": [59687]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:44:17.013968+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:44:17.014022+11:00"}

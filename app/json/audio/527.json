This kids' program debuted on ABC TV in 1994 and then, after two successful seasons, it has endured in Australian pop culture. Capitalising on the grunge aesthetic of the time, it followed an unruly bunch of feral animals living in a share house with flatmates played by human actors. The ditzy rabbit Mixy and sassy cat Modigliana were key members of the show, adding to the tradition of children's programming featuring puppets in starring roles, including <I>Lift Off</i> (1992-95) and <I>Mr Squiggle</i> (1959-99)."}, "work": {"id": 112012, "title": "The Ferals [Puppets]", "slug": "the-ferals", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183494_FeralsPuppets_FSF2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [51505]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:47:20.509338+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:47:20.509370+11:00"}

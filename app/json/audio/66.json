Besides the perfectly timed one-liners and unforgettable characters like Jim (Nick Giannopoulos) and Effie (Mary Coustas), it gave second-generation Greek Australians control of how they were portrayed - and what was acceptable to laugh at - and defied racial stereotypes that non-Greek actors, like <i>The Comedy Company</i>'s Con the Fruiterer (Mark Mitchell), perpetuated on Australian TV."}, "work": {"id": 107714, "title": "Acropolis Now", "slug": "acropolis-now", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183231_AcropolisNow_CrawfordProductions.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Crawford Productions", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1989-1992", "labels": [47207]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:23:24.431779+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:23:24.431810+11:00"}

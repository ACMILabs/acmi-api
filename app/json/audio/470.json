This Sony Betamovie BMC-100P model of camera carried Betamax cassette tapes, which were introduced by Sony in 1975. It was the first consumer camcorder, including both camera and recorder in a single unit that would become standard in the years to follow. The rival Betamax and VHS (Video Home System) formats were incompatible with each other, meaning buyers had to choose.

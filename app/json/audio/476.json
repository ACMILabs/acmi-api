Using multiple cameras triggered by trip wires, he captured a galloping horse in sequential images, reproduced them in a zoetrope and created the world’s first moving photographs.\r\n\r\nWhile Muybridge froze moments on separate photographs, French scientist Étienne-Jules Marey’s chronophotographic technique captured kinetic motion through multiple exposures in one photo. He used a photographic rifle with a revolving cylinder that shot 12 frames a second. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, American professor Harold ‘Doc’ Edgerton’s pioneering development of the electric stroboscopic flash suspended movement, stopping skipping ropes mid-swing – and even speeding bullets."}, "work": {"id": 100593, "title": "Splitting Time", "slug": "splitting-time", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180316_G024.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40089]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:29:42.040017+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:29:42.040048+11:00"}

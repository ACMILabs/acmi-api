As we can see from this costume sketch, Mrs Appleyard’s purple fete outfit was fabricated from scratch, while the reference materials illustrate some of the details that went into Edie Kurzer’s design of the garments. The costume sketch and accompanying mood board of Victorian-era collars show how Kurzer gathered a body of historical reference points while crafting the original garments, like the stunning purple and gold jacket that goes with Mrs Appleyard’s fete costume. On this reference board, there are several designs that closely mimic the high, V-shaped collar of the final jacket."}, "work": {"id": 120110, "title": "Picnic at Hanging Rock purple fete and mourning dress design materials", "slug": "picnic-at-hanging-rock-purple-fete-and-mourning-dress-design-materials", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P189479_PAHR_FeteDressSketch.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Edie Kurzer", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2017", "labels": [59575]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:49:48.519261+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:49:48.519291+11:00"}

Gina Riley and Jane Turner's hugely popular <i>Kath & Kim</i> hit screens in 2002, poking fun at Aussie suburbia and spawning a trend of mockumentary-style sitcoms. Meanwhile another female-driven show <i>The Secret Life Of Us</i> was breaking boundaries on Channel 10: Deborah Mailman's casting was a landmark moment for representation of Indigenous Australians in mainstream media. The hit series also acted as a training ground for a whole wave of prominent female filmmakers like Cate Shortland, Ana Kokkinos and Emma Freeman. Public broadcasters SBS and ABC had very different successes with <i>East West 101</i> for the former – a multicultural police procedural – and animated series Bluey becoming a global phenomenon for the latter."}, "work": {"id": 113976, "title": "2000 Australian TV miniature", "slug": "2000s", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P183631_2000sTVMiniature.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Megafun", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "labels": [53470]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:18:55.347113+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:18:55.347145+11:00"}

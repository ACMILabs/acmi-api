Eisenstein believed that juxtaposing different film shots created meaning, manipulated emotions and communicated ideas through visual metaphors. By the time he released his second film, <i>Battleship Potemkin</i> (1925), heâ€™d put the theory into practice: he assembled over 1,300 shots in an 82-minute film to tell the story of a shipboard mutiny, propelling the action through his new cinematic technique. Montage was unlike anything seen before and influenced not just directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese but also the rapidly edited style of advertising and music videos."}, "work": {"id": 100610, "title": "Sergei Eisenstein", "slug": "sergei-eisenstein", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180326_G034.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "1924-1928", "labels": [40099]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:21:19.371396+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:21:19.371429+11:00"}

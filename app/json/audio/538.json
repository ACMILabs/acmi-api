He used the red-and-green anaglyph system that most people associate with 3D. Audiences looked through red-and-green glasses at two film strips, recorded and projected in each colour, that gave the illusion of depth when superimposed.\r\n\r\nThe same system was used for <i>The Power of Love</i> (1922), the first feature 3D motion picture screened for a commercial audience. And 3D wasn’t that film’s only innovation: viewers could choose different endings by peering through only the red or green lens. It was the only film released using the Fairall-Elder stereoscopic camera pictured here."}, "work": {"id": 100619, "title": "The Power of Love", "slug": "the-power-of-love", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180379_G089.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Harry K.

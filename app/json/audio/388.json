Pepper’s ghost was an early special effect that projected ghosts onto theatre stages through light and reflection.\r\n\r\n“<i>Pepper’s ghost has typically been used in theatre, film and amusement park rides. This simple effect uses an angled pane of glass to create the illusion of a ghost-like image within another scene, exploiting the optical properties of glass as both a reflector and transmitter of light.\r\n\r\nIn my work I wanted to replicate this effect using simple abstract forms and flat fields of colour to draw attention to this merging of the two light images, while also laying bare the apparatus used to create the illusion.</i>” – Taree Mackenzie"}, "work": {"id": 107655, "title": "Pepper's ghost effect, triangles, cyan and red", "slug": "peppers-ghost-triangles-cyan-and-red", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P182512_PeppersGhost_Image1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Taree Mackenzie", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2018", "labels": [47148]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:46:02.752363+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:46:02.752393+11:00"}

Another man joins the women at the car, before we are transported to the busy streets of 1940s London, teeming with pedestrians. The scene shifts to a gregarious group of people gathered around a fountain, followed by several women in front of a building. The video progresses to show a well-dressed woman in fur and a man in a suit, before refocusing on various people around a clock. Finally, the video concludes with the charming image of three fashionable women feeding pigeons.\n\nOur scene starts with women from the 1940s, dressed in fur coats and hats, standing on a street corner. It transitions to the 1930s where we also see women, donned in hats and coats, in the street. Soon after, we spot a man and a woman amidst a lively crowd of pigeons in what appears to be the heart of London. This charming pair, along with other bystanders, engage in feeding the fluttering birds around a fountain. The scene then abruptly changes to a stark black background featuring a white clock.\n"}, "work": null, "created": "2023-10-23T10:13:59.142635+11:00", "updated": "2023-10-23T10:13:59.142669+11:00"}

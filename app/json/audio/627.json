The Daedalum, or ‘wheel of the Devil’, used a cylindrical viewing drum containing a strip of sequenced pictures viewable through thin slits. When rotated it created the illusion of motion, and it became known as the zoetrope.\n\nOver 40 years later, in 1877, French showman and lantern painter Charles-Émile Reynaud developed the praxinoscope, replacing the narrow viewing slots in Horner’s design with an inner circle of mirrors that more brightly reflected the pictures and let more than one person view the gliding images."}, "work": {"id": 114453, "title": "Zoetrope and praxinoscope", "slug": "zoetrope-and-praxinoscope", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO177013_ZoetropeWithIllustratedAnimationStrips_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [53945]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:18:40.037015+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:18:40.037043+11:00"}

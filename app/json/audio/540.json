Her work interrogates colonialism and its impact on Tasmania’s First Peoples.\n\nIn works such as \"The Silenced\" (2020) Gough uncovers and re-presents subsumed and often conflicting histories. These works are often deeply personal, referring to her own and her family’s experiences as Tasmanian Aboriginal people.\n\n“At least 185 Aboriginal children in Lutruwita / Van Diemen’s Land / Tasmania lived with colonists before the 1850s. The Silenced is an introduction to the task of finding these children within slim records. Reinstating them back on the Country they lived, isolated from their dead and exiled kin, amongst the colonists responsible, clearly reveals the genocidal intent of Empire.”"}, "work": {"id": 118032, "title": "The Silenced", "slug": "the-silenced", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000184_mi01_TheSilenced.tif.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Julie Gough", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [57534]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:53:39.157560+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:53:39.157591+11:00"}

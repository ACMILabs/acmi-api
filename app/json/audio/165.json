Dressed in a tall ship hat pretending to be a colonialist, the Mirning artist writes with her feather quill back to the colonial-mother-monarch of her times ‘down among the wild men’. From the shade of the gum tree. At the same time as her chronicling, she is attacked by a wild man, (fellow sovereign Yanyuwa artist), who with a super large fork pretend stabs her in the back and the pretend explorer/tall ship coloniser collapses. Even the trees are scared of us blackfellas the hand holding the tree is shaking in fear. The background soundtrack that the viewer cannot hear is us all laughing maniacally at the re-enactment of the anthropological and colonial gaze.” - Ali Gumillya Baker"}, "work": {"id": 117994, "title": "down among the wild men / colonial imagination", "slug": "down-among-the-wild-men-colonial-imagination", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000129_Downamongthewildmen_1_Still_001.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Ali Gumillya Baker", "headline_credit": "Mirning, 2014", "labels": [57496]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:59:36.693945+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:59:36.693977+11:00"}

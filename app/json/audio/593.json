It was first introduced in 1970 and was sold up until the early-1980s. It was popular for its modern design; the alarm clock base was an option however most units have a plain base.\n\nVideospheres were produced in large quantities in white, red, black and orange in the seventies with a grey colored model also released in the 1980s. The design of the videosphere is said to have been inspired by the film 2001: A Space Odyssey,[1] though the videosphere's shape in itself remains as one of the most iconic examples of the early 1970s design ethos.\n\nThe sci-fi look of the TV saw a red model appear as a background prop in the 1999 film The Matrix, though they have appeared in sci-fi films since the early 70s. Soylent Green had a red model on screen as a prop.The 1972 film Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, a black videosphere was shown with a color capable tube and a slot that allowed a cassette tape capable of playing video. Humorously, the color image on the videosphere goes from being rectangular in one scene to round in another scene.\n\nJVC Videosphere / Made in Japan / (Yokohama) / Serial # 10600147\n240 V / 50Hz / 12V / 11W (Australian AC power plug).

Her hero armour has been adapted to fit the bolder, more 80s look of the latest film, with stark, armoured panels of black and white.\r\nThompson loved the variety of looks for Valkyrie. “I love a costume change,” she said. “You get to see Valkyrie in these suited kingly looks, and then you get to see her in her pyjamas, which I love. Because when have you ever seen a superhero in pyjamas? Even heroes go to sleep.”\r\nShe continued: “I think that’s what’s really exciting about these films, in general, is to see the way in which characters evolve.”"}, "work": {"id": 120363, "title": "Valkyrie costume with sword, sheath and daggers", "slug": "valkyrie-costume-with-sword-sheath-and-daggers", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59828]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:04:09.874729+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:04:09.874759+11:00"}

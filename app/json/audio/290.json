This video has been widely shared and celebrated on social media, highlighting the compassion being shown to migrants on the US/Mexico border. Some viewers have questioned if its virality puts the work in danger, but  Las Patronas shared the original video to raise awareness and fund their work. According to a 2014 article, the group was formed 19 years earlier, so they've been helping people for almost 30 years â€“ far longer than social media has been around."}, "work": {"id": 121996, "title": "Las Patronas", "slug": "las-patronas", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/COTD_193497_Patronas.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "nked", "headline_credit": "20 FEB 2023", "labels": [61455]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:12:42.892423+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:12:42.892454+11:00"}

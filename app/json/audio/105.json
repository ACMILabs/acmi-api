Instead of continuous prints in a book, the mutoscope’s cards were attached to a reel and the images were animated when you turned a hand crank, much like Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope. It was also similar because it didn’t feature projection and only one person could view it at a time. Mutoscope scenes were silent (hence the name) and lasted for one minute. One of the machine’s most famous reels was <i>What the Butler Saw</i>, an early erotic film showing a woman partly undressing as if spied through a keyhole. This reel was so popular that the mutoscope was sometimes known as the ‘What the Butler Saw’ machine."}, "work": {"id": 4761, "title": "British Mutoscope featuring Charlie Chaplin reel", "slug": "mutoscope-fractured-flickers", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000176_Mutoscope_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "International Mutoscope & Biograph Syndicate", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 1897-1899", "labels": [718]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:37:07.597466+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:37:07.597499+11:00"}

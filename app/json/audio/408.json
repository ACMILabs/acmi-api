How else could you watch cricket at the beach or take your favourite show camping? Despite how portable these units were, due to using batteries, their small stature saw them positioned in the home just as much as the great outdoors, and they gradually became more of a fashion statement during the late 1970s and 80s. The most fashionable of the ones displayed here is easily the JVC Videosphere, which came in red, black, white and orange, and was designed to look like a space helmet, in homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey and the popularity of the Space Race in 1970 when it was released. It’s since appeared as props in Hollywood films and in video artist Nam June Paik’s installation, TV Buddha (1974)."}, "work": {"id": 114466, "title": "Portable TVs (Retro Vision)", "slug": "mpl-display-group-tv-cabinet", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000329_NationalRangerTV_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [53958]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:52:28.584121+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:52:28.584152+11:00"}

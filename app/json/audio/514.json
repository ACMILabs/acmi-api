If you find it a little difficult, you’re not alone.\r\n\r\nWhile it may look like a maze, it’s actually an abstract puzzle that uses colour to create the illusion of light and perspective. Attempts to maneuver through it in the expected way reveal that it’s a visual trick as the mind-bending environments warp and shift into abstraction. By deceiving the eye in this way, <i>The Catacombs of Solaris Revisited</i> offers an adventure of a different kind – a technicolour exploration of expectation and perspective in the game’s interactive environment.\r\n\r\nWhen its predecessor <i>The Catacombs of Solaris</i> came out in 2017, some players made an ‘art sport’ out of the game’s hallucinatory environments. Players competed against each other to try to manipulate the brightly coloured geometric shapes on screen to match an existing picture within a time limit – and so ‘Competitive <i>Catacombs of Solaris</i>’ was born."}, "work": {"id": 120343, "title": "The Catacombs of Solaris Revisited", "slug": "the-catacombs-of-solaris-revisited", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P190404_cCoS_2_-_by_Izzy_Gramp.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "labels": [59808]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:43:23.305519+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:43:23.305549+11:00"}

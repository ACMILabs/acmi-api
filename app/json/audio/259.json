William Rothenstein (1872–1945) was similarly concerned with portraying domestic environments. In his portraits of family and friends, he gives the surrounding spaces as much attention as the figures. Both artists took great care in accurately portraying light, from the highlights on the figures’ hair, skin and clothing in Rothenstein’s paintings to the effects of light and shadow on the walls and floor of Hammershøi’s home.\r\n\r\nThese deceptively simple but enigmatic paintings are paired with a contemporary work by Philippe Parreno (born 1964). The title 6.00 PM implies that the pattern at the centre of the carpet depicts the play of light and shadow cast through a window at six o’clock in the evening. But the carpet is always displayed in a windowless gallery and the image itself never changes. We can walk across and leave marks on the carpet, meaning we are unlikely to be tricked by the illusion. By fixing a particular moment of light, the work draws attention to connections between light and our perception of time.\r\n\r\n室内之光\r\n\r\n本展厅内的作品探索光在室内环境中的非戏剧性表现，展示了光对于我们体验世界的微妙影响，宛若电影摄影师拍摄的作品。\r\n\r\n维尔海姆·哈默肖伊(1864—1916)以沉静的肖像和富于沉思的室内作品著称，这些作品记录了他日常生活的细节。威廉·罗森斯坦(1872—1945)同样聚焦家庭环境的描绘。在他为家庭和朋友所作的肖像画中，他给予周围空间与人物同样多的关注。从罗森斯坦画作中人物头发、皮肤和服装上的亮点，到哈默肖伊家中墙壁和地板上的光影效果，我们都能看出两位艺术家都非常注重对光线的准确描绘。\r\n\r\n这些看似简单却又颇具神秘气息的画作与菲利普·帕雷诺（1964—）的当代作品搭配展出。作品的标题《下午6点》意味着地毯中央的图案描绘了傍晚六点透过窗户投射进来的光影游戏。但地毯总是在一个没有窗的展厅中展示，图像本身从未改变。我们可以走过去，并在地毯上留下痕迹，也就是说我们不太可能被幻觉欺骗。通过固定一个特定的光照时刻，作品提醒人们注意光线与我们对时间的感知之间的联系。"}, "work": {"id": 120290, "title": "Interior Light", "slug": "interior-light", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/T12411_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59755]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:02:41.025503+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:02:41.025534+11:00"}

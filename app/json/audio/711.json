At the same time, Canon was developing a micro-motor. This is how development of a movie camera with better operability, the core feature of these cameras, started. Instead of a conventional spring motor, it applied an electric motor that could drive film continuously much longer than a spring motor, fully using battery capability. Zooming was performed electrically, as was exposure control, which was called EE, or Electric Eye (AE, or Automatic Exposure today). These were major factors for a very compact movie camera design. Because of its three electric functions, it was named the “EEE”.\n\nThe lens was a newly developed 4x f/1.7 zoom lens. Aperture control with two outside levers made EE, manual exposure and fading operation easy. A film rewind crank was applied at the same time. As a result, this camera became suitable for both beginners and advanced amateurs\""}, "work": {"id": 99564, "title": "EEE Motor Zoom 8", "slug": "canon-eee-motor-zoom-8", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO179404_CanonEEEcamera_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Canon", "headline_credit": "Japan, c. 1962", "labels": [39059]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:41:31.600025+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:41:31.600054+11:00"}

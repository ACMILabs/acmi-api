Designed by a group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) dropouts who started a company called the General Computer Corporation (GCC), <i>Ms Pac-Man</i> was originally a modification for the original <i>Pac-Man</i>, called <i>Crazy Otto</i>. Due to legal action by Atari, GCC presented their modification kit to the North American <i>Pac-Man distributor</i>, who purchased it and worked with GCC to evolve the concept.\r\n\r\nThe result was <i>Ms Pac-Man</i>, which featured new mazes and improved the unpredictability of the ghost enemies to make the game more challenging. Original character designs featured Ms Pac-Man with hair, but this was soon replaced with her famous bow."}, "work": {"id": 117938, "title": "Ms Pac-Man arcade cabinet", "slug": "ms-pac-man-mame-cabinet", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181279_MsPacMan_ArcadeGame_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "General Computer Corporation, Midway and Namco", "headline_credit": "United States, 1982", "labels": [57433]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:36:24.724659+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:36:24.724690+11:00"}

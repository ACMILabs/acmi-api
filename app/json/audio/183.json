These actions are translated into graphical forms to show what’s being collected, as well as highlighting Constellations that share connections. Each time an object is collected, the visualisation updates in real-time to create a dynamic living map of our visitors’ journey: the more people in the space, the more active it becomes. Created by code and contemporary web technologies, <i>Entities</i> encourages visitors to discover new objects and artworks by seeing what others are collecting in the gallery over time."}, "work": {"id": 118034, "title": "Entities", "slug": "entities", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Entities.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Greg More (OOM Creative), James Sandri (MORE Studio), Pete Brundle (MORE Studio), MORE Studio and OOM Creative", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [57536]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:06:44.366008+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:06:44.366056+11:00"}

Designed specifically for ACMI by Studio MDHR, this zoetrope spins and uses strobe lighting to create the illusion of 90 individual characters magically coming to life. Watch as Cuphead, Mugman, Ms Chalice, King Dice and the Devil all animate before your eyes in a series of poses representing the way <i>Cuphead</i> mixes classic animation with modern digital gaming.\r\n\r\nHeavily inspired by the classic cartoons of the 1930s – particularly Fleischer Studios and Walt Disney – Studio MDHR used hand-drawn cel animation, watercolour backgrounds and original jazz recordings to create the world of Cuphead – one of the most successful run-and-gun videogames in recent memory."}, "work": {"id": 100277, "title": "Cuphead: Inspiration from the Inkwell", "slug": "cuphead-zoetrope-large", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181399_CupheadZoetrope_FullFront.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Studio MDHR and Megafun", "headline_credit": "Canada, 2020", "labels": [39773]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:50:04.569641+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:50:04.569673+11:00"}

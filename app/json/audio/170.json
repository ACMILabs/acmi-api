While the Lumière brothers and Thomas Edison wowed the public with their projections and contraptions, they also strove to create ways to watch in private. In 1896, the Lumière brothers came up with the Kinora, a smaller cinematic device that worked like a mutoscope and flickered through 40-second stories. By 1912, advancements in projection allowed the Edison Home Kinetoscope to cast the irregular 22mm film stock in homes. In the same year, the popular Pathé Kok camera and projector arrived, which used the more standard 28mm film and cast a 30-inch picture."}, "work": {"id": 100494, "title": "Early film equipment", "slug": "early-film-equipment", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO175952_LaPierreCinematograph_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [39990]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:01:48.737533+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:01:48.737565+11:00"}

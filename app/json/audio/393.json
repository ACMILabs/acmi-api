By manipulating digital footage as though it were a physical material, Crooks has constructed a collaged landscape, taking us through multiple worlds and shifting our perception of space and time.\r\n\r\n\"Phantom Ride <i>comes out of my long-held fascination with the convergence of trains, the birth of cinema and modern ideas and representations of time.\r\n\r\nI’ve presented it as a two-sided video; the forward-facing journey on one side and the rear looking journey on the reverse. The screen becomes a meniscus of the present, separating the past and the future.</i>” – Daniel Crooks"}, "work": {"id": 119, "title": "Phantom Ride", "slug": "phantom-ride", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000118_DanielCrooks_PhantomRide_2015.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Daniel Crooks", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2016", "labels": [801]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:47:57.525710+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:47:57.525741+11:00"}

As this life force reaches the outer extremities, from the billowing synapses of the brain to our fingers and toes, the interior blooms into a forest of branching pathways, suffused by a fog of life-bringing oxygen. Through this transcendental narrative, it becomes clear that breath not only sparks life, but also connects us to the natural world through the cycle of respiration.\r\n\r\nAt ACMI, <i>Evolver</i> is presented in its original VR form and as three large-scale, immersive moments. Below is an extract of the poem written by Daisy Lafarge that features in <i>Evolver</i>."}, "work": {"id": 122480, "title": "Evolver", "slug": "evolver", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_Evolver_2023_courtesy_of_the_artists_and_Wave_Museum_1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61938]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:09:46.197030+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:09:46.197063+11:00"}

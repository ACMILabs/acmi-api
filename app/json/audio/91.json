Evolving from the newly established National Black Theatre's stage production, <i>Basically Black</i> combined comedy, activism and performing arts while reflecting the political struggles and organising of 1960s and 70s Redfern. The first TV program performed by an all-Indigenous cast and led by Blak writers, this groundbreaking program tackled serious issues, like racism and white paternalism, through humour. Despite being well received for its biting satire and commentary, the show didnâ€™t air beyond its premiere. It later emerged that it was considered too political and provocative for the ABC, who had censored parts of the script."}, "work": {"id": 107708, "title": "Basically Black", "slug": "basically-black", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180417_G122_Basically_Black_Cast_Photo.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "ABC", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1973", "labels": [47201]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:32:18.435463+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:32:18.435497+11:00"}

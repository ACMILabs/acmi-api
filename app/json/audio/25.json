The popular video format is designed to attract attention, often by highlighting a user’s physicality and sexuality. It’s common among internet users but regularly used by influencers to gain attention, build followers and, at times, sell products. Jade Kim (@jadestradamus) stages this video similarly, sauntering into frame and suggestively applying lipstick. But instead of using her platform to sell something, she advocates for socialism, seemingly suggesting that if we paid as much attention to class consciousness as we did to thirst traps, the world might be a more equitable place."}, "work": {"id": 122235, "title": "Marx my words", "slug": "marx-my-words", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Cotd_TIKTOK_MarxMyWords_260523.JPG.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Jade Kim", "headline_credit": "United States, 01 SEP 2022", "labels": [61694]}, "created": "2024-01-12T11:15:14.118549+11:00", "updated": "2024-01-12T12:19:19.625386+11:00"}

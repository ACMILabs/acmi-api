Set in the fictional suburb of Wentworth, the female-centred prison drama reverberated around the world, spawning international adaptations and a massive cult following. Almost 30 years after it left the airwaves, <i>Prisoner</i> was rebooted in 2013 as <i>Wentworth</i> and updated to reflect contemporary culture. \r\n\r\n<i>Wentworth</i> has also been adapted internationally, but its impact on the local industry is just as important as its global reach, providing countless opportunities for women on both sides of the camera. It also explores complex female-focused themes including institutionalised power, female transgression and violence, motherhood and LGBTQIA+ sexuality."}, "work": {"id": 107713, "title": "Prisoner and Wentworth", "slug": "prisoner-and-wentworth", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180397_G106.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Fremantle International and Reg Grundy Productions", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1979-1986", "labels": [47206]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:00:14.806107+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:00:14.806139+11:00"}

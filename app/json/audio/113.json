While celebrating, practicing and sharing culture, this gaze continues to resist and disrupt popular ideas of Australian identity, place and nationhood.\r\n\r\n<i>Canopy</i> continues this tradition and comments on First Peoples self-representation.\r\n\r\n<i>“The canopy is teeming with life. It is a place where the biodiversity of species ensures the survival of us all. Through the imagery in my work, I’m exploring layers of being, from the individual to family, clan, culture, country and finally, to consciousness. </i>Canopy<i> invites audiences to still their minds and experience the work as a meditation with an open spirit and heart. It contains my home movies along with films I’ve written and directed.”</i> – John Harvey"}, "work": {"id": 117898, "title": "Canopy", "slug": "canopy", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000144_Canopy_still1.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "John Harvey", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [57392]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:40:33.827635+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:40:33.827682+11:00"}

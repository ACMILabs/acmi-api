Invented in Vienna, Austria in 1927 by Eduard Haas III, its name is derived from the German word for peppermint: PfeffErmintZ. The small, brick like candies are sold in the billions each year but it's the plastic, collectible dispensers that have made the brand famous. Often depicting cartoon versions of characters from film and television, they have also infiltrated pop culture, appearing in shows such as Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Japanese manga Bleach and having a whole Seinfeld episode named The Pez Dispenser in their honour."}, "work": {"id": 112019, "title": "PEZ", "slug": "pez", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183501_Pez_FSF9.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [51512]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:47:30.510963+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:47:30.511016+11:00"}

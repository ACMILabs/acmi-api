This Warlpiri-language miniseries owes its popularity to its distinctive cultural world of Warlpiri humour, music and experience, where nyurulypa (good tricks) are used to keep wrecked cars on the red-sand roads of outback Australia. The cast use mulga wood, spinifex and clever hacks to showcase their ingenious approach to mechanics. \r\n\r\nDemonstrating this winning combination of Warlpiri and car culture, Ngapa Jukuurpa (Water Dreaming) is painted on an old Ford ZF Fairlane in the series’ final episode. The Bush Mechanics drive the ‘Ngapa car’ to Broome to trade for pearl shells to use in a ceremony to break the drought."}, "work": {"id": 114499, "title": "Bush Mechanics car replica", "slug": "bush-mechanics-car-replica", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P183824_BushMechanicsCar.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Francis Jupurrula Kelly and Thomas Rice", "headline_credit": "2019", "labels": [53991]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:25:02.674352+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:25:02.674383+11:00"}

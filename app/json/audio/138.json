Faced with hostility from the townsfolk, Tilly gains respect and power by transforming the women with her masterful dressmaking skills.\r\n\r\nThe importance of costume design in <i>The Dressmaker</i> can’t be overstated. The colour and texture of Tilly’s garments provide a dazzling contrast to the harsh, dusty landscape and the equally rugged clothing worn before her arrival. The new dresses bring out the best and the worst in the townsfolk. Tilly’s designs give the women confidence and beauty, while also revealing their vanity and snobbery."}, "work": {"id": 122335, "title": "Costumes drive the narrative", "slug": "costumes-drive-the-narrative", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61794]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:48:20.363647+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:48:20.363693+11:00"}

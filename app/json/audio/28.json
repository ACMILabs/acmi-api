These films from the Koorie Oral History Program and the Bill Onus family archive preserve our culture and kinship for future generations.\r\n\r\n\"When we talk about Traditional Aboriginal knowledge in Victoria we need to remember it is one of the oldest living forms of communication in the world. It continues today as one of the main mediums through which cultural knowledge and story lines are passed on. The images you will see in this exhibition reflect the value and importance of oral knowledge as an ongoing and vibrant cultural link with the past.‚Äù - Dr Wayne Atkinson senior Yorta Yorta Elder and creator of the Koorie Oral History Program"}, "work": {"id": 118182, "title": "The Koorie Oral History Program and the Bill Onus family archive", "slug": "the-koorie-oral-history-program-and-the-bill-onus-family-archive", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/MemoryGardenHands.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "ACMI", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [57684]}, "created": "2024-01-12T11:15:54.534578+11:00", "updated": "2024-01-12T12:20:38.823792+11:00"}

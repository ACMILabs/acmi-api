Narrated by Oscar-winner Cate Blanchett, the meditation was crafted by Marshmallow Laser Feast in collaboration with award-winning poet Daisy Lafarge.\r\n\r\nThe meditation draws on the science and spirituality of resonance breathing. From Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity and Kundalini Yoga to Indigenous American and African cultures, sacred prayers, chants and mantras attune practitioners to the sublime. Across all cultures, these sacred techniques involve controlled breathing and take approximately six seconds to recite. Theyâ€™re ancient traditions that form the basis of mindfulness, which often features meditations of controlled inhaling and exhaling for five to six seconds each. \r\n\r\nIn science, this is called resonance breathing. Growing research shows that achieving this flow lowers the body into a state of coherence, maximising the efficiency of our heart, circulation and nervous system. By adopting this essential and powerful tool of the human body, we can relieve stress, build resilience and harmonise ourselves with the natural world."}, "work": {"id": 122482, "title": "Evolver: Deep Listening Meditation", "slug": "evolver-deep-listening-meditation", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Evolver_Meditation_ACMI_Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_Works_of_Nature_13308_Photo_EugeneHyland.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Marshmallow Laser Feast", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2022", "labels": [61940]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:26:39.323456+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:26:39.323487+11:00"}

Modern consoles often have built-in features that let users easily record their play to share online, but this video isn’t that.

It’s like digital cosplay and reflects a larger trend of social users recreating game worlds in real life – like giving strangers quests as if in a fantasy game – which highlights the blurring of online and offline life. It’s been viewed over 40m times and endlessly shared."}, "work": {"id": 121793, "title": "GTA 6 in real life", "slug": "gta-6-in-real-life", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Catch_of_the_Day_GTA_in_real_life.JPG.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Ghetto Trio", "headline_credit": "United States, 29 SEP 2022", "labels": [61252]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:24:23.544770+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:24:23.544803+11:00"}

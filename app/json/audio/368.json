As seen in her groundbreaking documentary, <i>My Survival as an Aboriginal</i> (1978), she taught culture – and the importance of cultural knowledge – to her community. Importantly, her documentary also exposed how First Peoples were marginalised in all aspects of their lives, from school to wider society. The treatment of First Peoples laid bare in her documentary reached wider audiences through screenings at prestigious Australian and international film festivals, where the film won numerous awards. For her dedicated services to the Indigenous Australian community, Coffey herself was awarded an Order of Australia."}, "work": {"id": 107709, "title": "My Survival as an Aboriginal", "slug": "essie-coffey", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/FC180208_FC102_Still_01_1498311.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Essie Coffey", "headline_credit": "Australia, 1978", "labels": [47202]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:37:21.865542+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:37:21.865607+11:00"}

In the work, visitors will see themselves reflected in this matter, exploring the cosmic connection between black holes, dying stars and our very existence."}, "work": {"id": 122514, "title": "Distortions in Spacetime", "slug": "distortions-in-spacetime", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_Distortions_in_Spacetime_2018_courtesy_of_the_artists_3.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Marshmallow Laser Feast", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2020", "labels": [61972]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:56:48.306919+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:56:48.306968+11:00"}

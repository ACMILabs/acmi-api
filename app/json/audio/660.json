Beam was the first Australian studios to produce games for NES, and <i>Bad Street Brawler</i> has an infamous place in NES history: it was one of just two games ever designed to be used with the Power Glove, a wearable controller with NES buttons along the forearm that could also detect finger movement. Using the Power Glove with the game unlocked extra fighting moves that could be used in the game.  \r\n\r\nThe Power Glove could have been a perfect match for a street fighting game about punching and kicking your way through waves of enemies, but the controllerâ€™s slow reaction times, and sensitive calibration, made it unwieldy to use. Ultimately both the game and Glove were poorly received."}, "work": {"id": 108291, "title": "Nintendo Bad Street Brawler videogame", "slug": "nintendo-bad-street-brawler-videogame", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO179231_BadStreetBrowlerVideoGame_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Mattel", "headline_credit": "Japan, 1990", "labels": [47784]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:28:41.304494+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:28:41.304526+11:00"}

The fantastical adventures of a family living in a coastal lighthouse featured side-splitting humour, a little horror and a lot of humanity – plus an unforgettable theme song. \r\n\r\nDeveloped by the Australian Children’s Television Foundation and based on the work of beloved children’s author Paul Jennings (who helped write many of the early episodes), the four series pushed the boundaries of good taste, much to the delight of its young audience. As the books and graphic novels here suggest, the show was a sensation.\r\n\r\nThese hand-drawn VFX storyboards show the creative process behind the third season episode \"Brainless\", and match what you can see on the screen. They were developed to demonstrate how the visual effects and props – including the Viking Book of Love displayed in the wall case behind you – were to be used in the show. Alongside the beloved characters, props and practical special effects were often used to bring the comedy and bizarre, magical stories to life.\r\n\r\nStoryboards use visuals to effectively communicate ideas during the filmmaking process, providing a blueprint for cast and crew ahead of shooting scenes."}, "work": {"id": 121968, "title": "Storyboarding in Round the Twist", "slug": "round-the-twist-was-required-viewing-for-generations-of-australian-kids-the-fantastical-adventures-of-a-family-living-in-a-coastal-lighthouse-featured-side-splitting-humour-a-little-horror-and-a-lo", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P192979_RoundTheTwistGraphicNovel_detail.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61427]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:13:05.493855+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:13:05.493886+11:00"}

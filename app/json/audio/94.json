Davis in particular, preferred this model due to its lightweight and dependable nature, namely in challenging environmental conditions like shooting on the frontline with South Vietnamese troops. Travelling light enabled Davis to become part of the action and blend seamlessly to show the world the harsh realities of what was actually happening on the ground in Vietnam. Combat photographers often carried several cameras, including a bulkier model with a separate sound recorder."}, "work": {"id": 100239, "title": "Bell and Howell Filmo 70DR", "slug": "bell-and-howell-filmo-70dr-16mm-camera", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO177010_BellAndHowell16mmCamera_Display.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Bell and Howell", "headline_credit": "United States, c. 1960s", "labels": [39735]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:32:49.166525+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:32:49.166557+11:00"}

Strips of 35mm film featuring 14 stereo images were fed into the Tru-Vue, and a lever advanced the film and story. When held up to the light, the images appeared in 3D.\r\n\r\nIn 1951, Tru-Vue merged with the popular View-Master system, which used circular colour reels that brought tourist attractions and travel images to life in 3D. Some of the most popular View-Master reels included virtual tours of the newly built Disneyland, as well as stories featuring Mickey Mouse, Peter Pan and other popular Disney characters."}, "work": {"id": 99988, "title": "Lighted stereo viewer model F", "slug": "view-master", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO180831_SawyerBakeliteViewMaster_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Sawyer's Inc.", "headline_credit": "United States, c. 1950s", "labels": [39484]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:18:47.075635+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:18:47.075671+11:00"}

In the work, visitors will see themselves reflected in this matter, exploring the cosmic connection between black holes, dying stars and our very existence."}, "work": {"id": 122494, "title": "Distortions in Spacetime", "slug": "mlf-distortions-in-spacetime", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/_2023_11_21_ACMI_Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_Works_of_Nature_13159_Photo_EugeneHyland_1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61952]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:15:26.173206+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:15:26.173239+11:00"}

Her lead actress, silent-era ‘It’ girl Clara Bow, was having trouble transitioning to talkies. Bow was famous for her energetic, flapper-style performances, which she couldn’t do while being still for the microphone to record her dialogue. To let Clara move freely, Arzner rigged a microphone to a fishing rod and created the first ever boom mic. It wasn’t Arzner’s only achievement: <i>The Wild Party</i> was the first talkie directed by a woman, and she was the first female member of the Directors Guild of America – not to mention she made over 20 films during her illustrious career."}, "work": {"id": 100548, "title": "Dorothy Arzner and the boom mic", "slug": "dorothy-arzner-and-the-boom-mic", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180372_G082.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40044]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:58:57.182836+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:58:57.182866+11:00"}

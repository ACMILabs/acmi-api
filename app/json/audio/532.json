Deep crimson and orange hues capture both the majesty and the innocence of his childhood in the Forbidden City, while grey saturates his moments in jail later in life.\r\n\r\nThese costumes, by James Acheson, enliven the Imperial court with rich reds that bring grandeur to the screen, a sense that's reinforced by 9,500 extras who appear to be draped in delicately embroidered silk thanks to screen-printed rayon."}, "work": {"id": 100513, "title": "The Last Emperor costumes", "slug": "the-last-emperor-costume-display-group", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO175774_ImperialGuardCostume_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "James Acheson", "headline_credit": "France and Italy, 1987", "labels": [40009]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:49:34.052843+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:49:34.052874+11:00"}

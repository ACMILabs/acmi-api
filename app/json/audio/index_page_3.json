Quickly, we're introduced to a poster from a young filmmaker's international film festival. Surprisingly, the year is 1944! This young filmmaker won the 'just for fun' second prize. As we continue, we find they're part of the 'Brighton Grammar Film Makers Club'. Two black and white pictures follow, one showing a festive gate sign in Mexico, and the other featuring an adorable dog by a worded fence.\n\nThe video begins to pan through black and white photos. First, there's a picture of a gate with the sign 'Stoyy Greeley'. Next, another image of a fence and a sign comes into view. This is followed quickly by another shot of a fence with a 'Fast Solution' sign. The video then shows another gate shot with a sign and a 'Do Not Enter' sign. A woman can be seen standing behind a fence in the subsequent picture, and later, a boy is seen with his dog in front of a fence. The boy, now alone, is then shown engrossed in a book. The final moments reveal photos of a building surrounded by a fence and a fenced area with a car parked in front.\n\nThe video shows various scenes: a man hangs from a tree near a wall, then shares a moment with a boy and another man. The boy and a dog are seen lying near a brick wall. A man on a bicycle rides past these scenes. There is a man wearing a hat standing next to a fence and filming a fellow man strolling with his dog. A man is seen resting against a wall with his skateboard while several people walk on the adjacent sidewalk. The scenes end with a black and white image of a boy running down the street and a man leaning against a wall with a woman standing by his side.\n\nThe scene opens with two people beside a wall, shortly joined by two boys from the 1940s in striped shirts and hats. A black and white image of a boy next to a fence is shown. The scene then shifts to a group of young people strolling down a street, followed by two men walking a dog in a park. A glimpse of men from the 1940s strolling along a fence in a field is seen. The scene transitions again with a group of individuals with a dog walking down a path. A boy in a sweater and tie from the 1940s strides along with his friends in Australia. The scene closes with a black and white image of people in front of a house and a separate image of a house with folks standing outside.\n\nFirst, there's a group of boys strolling by a fence, followed by a man walking his dogs alongside the same fence. He then stands in the doorway of a shed before he's seen writing on a bulletin board, like from the 1940s. There's an image of a chalkboard with some writing clearly visible. We transition to the scene of a man sitting casually in a room with a TV, and then a young man and a boy engrossed in a game of cards. A young boy is shown next sitting in a chair holding a cell phone. We then see a 1940s shot of a boy in a striped shirt and straw hat. The scene concludes with a black and white photo of three men in the 1940s, sharing stories on a porch.\n\nPeople gather around a table. One man presents a letter he's holding. An old image comes into focus, revealing an aged fence and bench before a house. This house emerges in reality, where a man is spotted strolling nearby. He stops to survey the area from a window and leans on a fence. He later kneels near the house's window, where inside, two curious boys peer out. Finally, there's another glimpse of a note held in someone's hand.\n\nIn this moving scene, we first see three boys engaged in conversation in an area that feels homely. The scene portrays historical imagery through a 1956 black and white photograph of these boys sitting on a bench. The narrative then diverts to two suited men in a 1940s backyard setting. We see these very characters daringly climbing a fence in front of a household. \n\nA noteworthy item is an old photo capturing a roller coaster in a park, instilling a sense of nostalgia in the viewer. The final scene beautifully puts focus back on a lone boy sitting on a bench. This black and white picture provides an endearing close to this sequence.\n\nThe video depicts a collection of black and white historical photos. Firstly, we see an image of a young boy sitting alone on a park bench. The park, adorned with palm trees, also has two men standing near one of these palms. Fast forward, our attention drifts towards a man sitting leisurely near the tree. We are then introduced to a unique old building printed with a giant face. Lastly, the scene concludes with a bustling street full of people going about their day.\n\nThe scene shows black and white imagery from mid-20th century. People are walking in front of buildings, through a mall, and even waiting in a line to enter the Masonic Temple in San Francisco. Also seen is a photograph of a clock tower.\n\nThe video includes several black and white photos. First, there's a man on a balcony. Then we see a 1940s scene of a couple walking by a ghost train.

The video then features people behind a fence, others strolling down a street, and a scene with a boat on a river. For a nostalgic dip, children enjoy a boat ride in a 1930s water park, and finally, we see a group of men sitting in a tunnel.\n\nA woman and a boy are pictured sitting on a couch. The scene transitions to a 1940s gentleman standing in front of a sign promoting an amusement park. We see two boys by a vending machine, and old photographs appear showing a roller coaster, a carousel ride and people enjoying bumper cars. A man from the 1930s drives a merry-go-round car while 1940s children have fun with bumper cars at a fair. The sequence concludes with a black and white image of pedestrians fronting a built structure.\n\nThe video presents images from the 1940s. It begins with people strolling before a building, then transitions to a young boy posed in front of a sign. We then see photos of a man and a woman enjoying a merry-go-round, followed by an image of a man seated comfortably in a chair. Next, there's a glimpse of a man standing by a carnival ride, and a crowd gathered outside a carnival. The next image showcases a boy and a girl together, then there's a scene that has people gathered around a food stand.

The first image shows a ferris wheel. Moving along, we see a man walking by a building marked \"open\". Next, we have a glimpse of 1953 as men in suits gather at a counter. Followed by an image portraying a man smoking a cigarette. Then, let's go into a lab, where a man in a coat stands by a fridge. Another picture shows a man engrossed in conversation with others.\n\nWe're taken back to the 1940s where we see an image of a teacher engaging with students in a classroom. Moving forward, we encounter a noteworthy image of a sign reading \"whale of the sea\". Following is a picture of a man proudly standing in front of a carnival. Finally, we dive into another scene from the 1940s, with men in white coats strolling through a carnival.\n\nThe video takes us back to the 1940s. The opening scene sows men in white shirts and ties on a boat, with one helping another with his tie. The lens shifts to a vibrant carnival attended by children. Those same children are later seen waiting at a train station. An adult conversation between two men and a woman is captured, followed by a scene of a group of people strolling near a fence.\n\nThe video then displays a vintage photo of a grand roller coaster with a clock tower, setting a nostalgic tone. In another shot, people are gathered around a bus.\n\nThe next frame shows an old building labelled 'Big Dipper' in a black and white photograph, likely the name of the roller coaster earlier shown. The film's closing sequence loops footage of people on a boat, showing us their journey as they crisscross the waters.\n\nThe video showcases various historical black-and-white photos. First, we see an image of a man on a vintage roller coaster, followed by a photo of another old roller coaster carrying a flag. Switching focus, two young boys sit cheerfully on a bench, laughing.

The sequence closes with a photo of a person standing on a chair and a woman happily holding a cigarette.\n\nOur tour includes historical black and white images featuring an impressive roller coaster against a city backdrop, two individuals strolling down a street, a group of boys gathered in a room, and three clowns posing before a sign. Additionally, there are repeated sights of a man walking down a street, followed by a scene of a couple standing before a gigantic face.\n\nFirst, we see a large face depicted in a black and white picture against the backdrop of an imposing building. Then, there's an emphasis on an ominous message: \"the end of the world\", repeated several times which creates quite a surreal atmosphere. Finally, we spot another black and white image, this time of a sign bearing the names 'Lights, R Bannant Gill' and 'Editor I Jane'."}, "work": null, "created": "2023-11-13T14:55:20.628223+11:00", "updated": "2023-11-13T14:55:20.628254+11:00"}, {"id": 9, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/video_1616.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "Our video begins with a logo before showing a man on a ladder beside a building, peeping out from a window.

Next, a unique sign displaying a face decorates a building and a man's face is captured in another monochrome photo on a pole. The scene shifts to a man on a ladder, likely fixing a house. A chair and a book are revealed in a dim-lit area. Moving forward, we see our man again, this time painting a house using his ladder. Interestingly, it seems like a scene from the 1930s of a man at work on a wooden house.

A woman is seen pedalling in front of a house, and later, two people are spotted cyclling together. Meanwhile, another man is riding past a sign with names: Art Rossiter, Beth Ketchum, and Van Rombly.

Recollections surface of an endearing family of four basking in the sunshine, children frolicking in the yard and cooling off in the backyard pool. The footage lets us peek into an era when children's laughter filled neighbourhoods, as they merrily played on the ground. Family bonding was paramount, be it during leisurely walks down the street or while gathered around a man, possibly telling tales.

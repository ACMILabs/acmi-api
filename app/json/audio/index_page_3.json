It transitions to a 1930s cycling race in a British park. There's a man riding a bike with \"our friends why\" displayed on it. Then, it takes us to a 1955 Australian road race in Brisbane with both British riders and cars present. The scene shifts to black and white images of people riding bicycles during the 1930s. A woman is seen pedalling in front of a house, and later, two people are spotted cyclling together. Meanwhile, another man is riding past a sign with names: Art Rossiter, Beth Ketchum, and Van Rombly. The scene ends with a tranquil black and white photo of a dog lying on the ground.\n\nThis montage starts with a young boy gently holding a dog, then moves on to display the cover of a direction by J.B Rudfield. It takes us back to the 1940s as we see a man and a woman standing by a bicycle on a grassy field. The vintage theme continues with a man and boy leisurely riding their bikes in a park. A nostalgic black and white photo showcases a bike parked serenely in a park. The timeless scenes from the past continue with a black and white photo of people playing tennis in a yard and a woman from the 1930s strolling in the park under her umbrella. Black and white photographs of people enjoying a game on the lawn and against a brick wall cap this blast from the past.\n\nA man leans down to pick up a piece of string. Then we see a series of old black and white photos showcasing a lively, tree-lined street full of pedestrians. The scene shifts to the 1940s, where a man rides his bicycle with a woman. Close-ups of the bicycle's wheel are followed by images of a man sitting by his bicycle on the ground. Eventually, he lays down next to his bicycle. The final shots feature a gathering of people around the fallen cyclist.\n\nOur scene begins with a black and white image of people lounging by a pool. A man stands nearby, soon assisting a woman in a chair. We then see two young lads and a dog in a yard, followed by three boys engrossed in a project together. A crowd of men gather, focused on a seated man. Seemingly from 1955, we spy a family relaxing in their backyard pool. Finally, we see a man in front of a house, with lush plants.\n\nOur scene begins with a group of people casually walking down a street. A black and white photo is shown next, capturing a trio on their foot journey. Soon, we glimpse an old photo of a storefront, with a car conveniently parked nearby. This image transitions to show people gathered outside the same store. \n\nOur eyes lead us to an intriguing photo taken around the 1950s, where men huddle outside a milk store. A similar snapshot from perhaps the 1940s reveals a larger crowd outside another shop. We see a gathering around a curious sign that reads \"kite 10\", attaching some narrative to the store. \n\nFinally, attention is drawn to a man, distinguished by the rope he clutches in his hand, surrounded by a band of young men.\n\nWe're looking at vintage black-and-white photos. The first one shows a group of men from the 1940s standing outside a storefront. There are even cars parked nearby. We then see a picture of people standing outside a house. Following that are images of boys gathered around a fence, and even pointing at something. The final image is of two boys together.\n\nOur view begins with the cover of 'The Boys of the Summer' book. The scene shifts to a vintage car from 1954 getting washed, with two boys industriously cleaning it in the driveway. A woman can be seen wiping down the hood, and shortly after, a young boy washing the window. Then, a man in a suit is spotted near the car, engaging in a conversation with another gentleman dressed similarly. A handshake is exchanged with a boy. Following this, a nostalgic black and white photograph of a boy and a girl amusing themselves with a flower comes into view before we see three boys planting flowers in a garden.\n\nThis silent video showcases a variety of historic, black and white photos. It starts with an individual watering a plant and proceeds with a lady from the 1930s elegantly dressed outside a brick building; a 1940s lady strolling in a yard follows. The video then features a joyful scene of a boy and his father from the 1940s playing baseball in the yard. We also see a snapshot of beach-goers in the 1930s at a wooden fence, followed by a quirky 1953 picture of a crowd before a sign welcoming them to the \"world's largest public toilet\". More signs are shown, and a cowboy gestures with his hand up. It concludes with two scenes of people gathered around fences.\n\nYou'll first see a sign for the Museum of the Zoo. Next comes a drawing of a bearded man, followed by a black and white photo of another man holding a sign. Watch out for Thomas the Tank Engine! You'll also see two people wearing masks with their own signs. A man named Jim Williams is next, standing in his suit by a sign. Then you'll see fun-loving people in costumes by a fence, a lady sporting a headdress calling herself Princess Panache, artwork by James McCormick titled \"Mad Dog and The Man\" from 1955, and finally, a black and white snap of a bird in a cage.\n\nA man in a suit stands by a 'Welcome to the Congo' sign. There's another sign reading 'All your base are belong to us'. A young boy dons a witch hat, holding a sign. Beside a fence, a young man reveals a chest tattoo. An old, monochrome photo shows a suitcase nestled within another suitcase, positively brimming with clothes. Two boys in the 1940s play with a plant in their yard. Another image, also in black and white, shows two hands holding an object. A 1940s boy presents a girl with flowers. Lastly, a man stands outside a store by a sign.\n\nThis exhibit showcases a series of black and white vintage photos from 1940s to 1950s. First, we see a man and woman standing outside a store, followed by scenes of everyday life. We glimpse at boys heading off to school, a solitary person resting on a bench and a group of people strolling down a path. The series caps off with an heritage photo of a backyard featuring a simple lawn chair and an umbrella.\n\nIn 1955, a family spends time by their pool in the suburbs of New York City. They gather around a man sitting on a lawn chair. The scene includes a young couple, a boy and a girl, sat on lawn chairs as well. A woman with an umbrella is visible, as well as people strolling in front of the house and down the sidewalk. The view of the house reveals a fenced property. A memorable image shows two men standing in the garden. These black and white photos depict a quintessential suburban backyard gathering.\n\n\nThe silent video captures the simple joys of the 1940s and 1950s suburban life in Sydney, Australia. Recollections surface of an endearing family of four basking in the sunshine, children frolicking in the yard and cooling off in the backyard pool. The footage lets us peek into an era when children's laughter filled neighbourhoods, as they merrily played on the ground. Family bonding was paramount, be it during leisurely walks down the street or while gathered around a man, possibly telling tales. The black and white imagery adds a nostalgic touch to life in a bygone era.\n\nThe video shows various scenes from the past. Two boys are playing in the water in the 1940s. By 1962, a man is being helped from a pool. Other snapshot from 1940s reveals a man surfing. Then, a vintage aerial photo of a person appears, followed by the image of a laughing boy. Next, we see Monty the fish enjoying swim within a life ring in 1955. The 1930s memory presents children having fun in a pool. Moving forward, a photograph of a boy splashing in water is showcased. The frame then shifts to a beaming boy shot against a backdrop of a bush. Lastly, a man is pictured with a bird perched on his held stick.\n\nThe video shows a series of scenes, beginning with a group of boys and a man laying on the ground, followed by a close up of the man with his eyes closed. Next, we see a vintage black and white photo of a man helping a child, then a man in water. The video moves on to show children near a pool, then shifts to 1930s men playing baseball in the street. There's also a touching black and white photo of two people holding hands, which leads to an image of a balloon with a face on it. The video concludes with a black and white photo of a balloon marked 'the end'.\n\nThe scene presents a simple yet striking black background, accented by a solitary white clock."}, "work": null, "created": "2023-11-13T14:37:26.657432+11:00", "updated": "2023-11-13T14:37:26.657470+11:00"}, {"id": 7, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/work_119205.mp3", "transcription": {"text": "<b>This video features in a responsive display in the museum that presents the moments, stories and memes capturing the zeitgeist by going viral on the internet.</b>\r\n\r\nDedicated to amplifying women’s voices and advocating for female equality, The Female Lead teamed up with Heather Chelan and Fred Cox for ‘We need pockets’.

Because of its accessibility and popularity, itâ€™s no surprise that we receive so many donations from the community, which along with the film itself, also comprises editing equipment and cameras. The Hanimex Eiki 16mm film projector displayed in this cabinet is typical of the kinds used in schools up until the 1980s, where films were screened in assembly halls to supplement standard learning in classrooms."}, "work": {"id": 113911, "title": "16mm Film", "slug": "mpl-display-group-16mm-viewer-with-16mm-reel-stacks", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000330_Ohnar16mmEditorViewer_34armsopen.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [53405]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:14:19.024477+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:14:19.024509+11:00"}

This dynamic and overwhelming assemblage of images reflects the abundance of moments and messages we encounter in the world, which is represented as a complex and synthesised totality. But with so much happening, how do we focus on a singular experience and create meaning?\r\n\r\nThat is the central question von Sturmer raises in this multi-screen work, which uses impromptu recordings and tabletop experiments to invite the viewer to negotiate between singular moments and discordant fragments of experience."}, "work": {"id": 118031, "title": "CATARACT (concrete)", "slug": "cataract-concrete", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000134_Cataract_DanielvonSturmer.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Daniel von Sturmer", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [57533]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:42:14.461565+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:42:14.461596+11:00"}

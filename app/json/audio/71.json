She made hundreds of films between 1896 and the 1920s, including the first fictional film with a scripted narrative, <i>La Fée aux Choux</i> (<i>The Cabbage Fairy</i>, 1896).\r\n\r\nGuy-Blaché later experimented with early synchronised sound, colour and special effects, often filming on location with hundreds of extras. In 1912 she made <i>A Fool and His Money</i>, widely believed to be the first film to have an all–African American cast."}, "work": {"id": 100599, "title": "Alice Guy-Blaché", "slug": "alice-guy-blache", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180320_G028.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1900", "labels": [40093]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:26:37.447532+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:26:37.447586+11:00"}

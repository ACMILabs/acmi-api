The scene transitions to him in a room, standing by a chair before it shifts to a 1930s setting. It shows a boy, then a man reading a newspaper in their room. Suddenly, the ambiance turns suspenseful as we see a man in a vest standing in the dark. Finally, we're shown a backyard scene with a man holding a gun.\n\nOur visuals begin with an old photograph of a pole in a yard. We then meet a man, distraught in front of a door. Next, a unique sign displaying a face decorates a building and a man's face is captured in another monochrome photo on a pole. The scene shifts to a man on a ladder, likely fixing a house. A chair and a book are revealed in a dim-lit area. Moving forward, we see our man again, this time painting a house using his ladder. Interestingly, it seems like a scene from the 1930s of a man at work on a wooden house. Finally, the words \"The End\" conclude our journey."}, "work": null, "created": "2023-11-13T14:48:34.430382+11:00", "updated": "2023-11-13T14:48:34.430411+11:00"}

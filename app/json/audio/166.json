There are two reasons for that: it was animated by legend Don Bluth, the man behind <i>The Land Before Time</i> (1988); and it used LaserDisc technology, allowing for dramatically better graphics and sound than other games released in 1983.\r\n\r\nIt was advertised as the first truly 3D videogame, but it maybe should’ve been advertised as the hardest videogame. Notorious for its difficulty, the gameplay features timed button/stick movements to advance the story and was deliberately designed to eat up as many coins as possible, even though it was already twice as expensive as typical games.\r\n\r\nDespite the game being a little frustrating to casual players, <i>Dragon’s Lair’s</i> beautiful animation and unique gameplay means it has endured in pop-culture consciousness: it’s featured in many films and TV shows, including <i>Family Guy</i> (1999) and <i>Stranger Things</i> (2016)."}, "work": {"id": 100854, "title": "Dragon's Lair", "slug": "dragons-lair-arcade-cabinet-and-video-game-1983", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181275_DragonsLair_ArcadeGame_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Cinematronics", "headline_credit": "United States, 1983", "labels": [40342]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:00:15.754062+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:00:15.754092+11:00"}

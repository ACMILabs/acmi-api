Through interviews, archival footage and scenes from film and TV, Foley explores the Black Power movement and the period during the 1970s and 80s when First Peoples began taking control of their representation in Australian screen culture, as well as how the moving image has been used to advocate for Indigenous Rights.\n\n“It has been a journey recording Gary about the early years of film. How do you fit the wealth of information into an eight-minute space? I have had the privilege of recording many of the Indigenous trailblazers of the early years of television and film and know how important it is for us to remember those who made a mark on our landscape for us to dream, to make the films and stories we do now. As a person who loves their craft, I hope this gives you a glimpse of the power of our voices on-screen.” – Pauline Clague"}, "work": {"id": 118132, "title": "Indigenous Voices on the Screen with Professor Gary Foley", "slug": "indigenous-voices-on-the-screen-with-professor-gary-foley", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "Pauline Clague", "headline_credit": "Yaegl, 2020", "labels": [57634]}, "created": "2024-01-12T11:14:11.876623+11:00", "updated": "2024-01-12T12:17:01.189980+11:00"}

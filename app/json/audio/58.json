It used 9.5mm film with central perforations. This unique film width made it easy to duplicate commercial films for home use, and the hand-cranked projector took up to 60 feet of film.\n\nThe portability and simplicity of the Pathé-Baby made the system widely popular internationally. This one was used by pioneering Australian aviator John Robertson Duigan MC to document early aviation and his home life. Having built the first Australian-made aircraft, Duigan definitely had something worth capturing."}, "work": {"id": 100536, "title": "9.5mm Pathé-Baby camera and projector", "slug": "95mm-pathe-baby-camera-and-projector", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000275_BabyPatheCamera_wBox.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Pathé Frères", "headline_credit": "France, 1922", "labels": [40032]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:21:05.017424+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:21:05.017455+11:00"}

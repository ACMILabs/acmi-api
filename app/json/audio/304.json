A leading director, screenwriter, producer and actor, she helped establish the use of split-screens to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film <i>Suspense</i>, and she experimented with synchronised sound. In an estimated 200 to 400 films, Weber explored social issues such as poverty, capital punishment, drug abuse and abortion. Her controversial film <i>Hypocrites</i> (1915) featured the first full-frontal nude scene.\r\n\r\n“<i>She writes her own stories and continuity, selects her cast, directs the pictures, plans to the minutest detail all the scenic effects, and, finally, titles, cuts and assembles the film. Few men have assumed such responsibility.</i>” – Aline Carter, <i>Motion Picture</i>, 1921"}, "work": {"id": 100605, "title": "Lois Weber", "slug": "lois-weber", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180323_G031.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "United States, c. 1916", "labels": [40096]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:21:48.373112+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:21:48.373143+11:00"}

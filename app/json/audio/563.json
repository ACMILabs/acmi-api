In 1881 he simplified his own design, creating a new portable optical toy called the toupie-fantoche, or ‘spinning top’. The toupie-fantoche consisted of a handle and a pyramid lined with mirrors at 45 degrees that reflected sequential images on a disc above. When the spinning top rotated, the rapid succession of illustrations gave the impression of one moving image. Typical scenes included butterflies fluttering, dogs jumping through hoops and drummer boys drumming."}, "work": {"id": 100288, "title": "Toupie-fantoche (Spinning Top)", "slug": "toupie-fantoche-spinning-top", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181400_ToupieFantoche.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1881", "labels": [39784]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:58:28.263036+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:58:28.263066+11:00"}

Though it lasted just two seconds, <i>Roundhay Garden Scene</i> was revolutionary. Le Prince prepared to exhibit his invention in New York in 1890, but before he got the chance he mysteriously disappeared from a train after visiting his brother in France.\r\n\r\nMonths later, American inventor Thomas Edison patented a camera suspiciously similar to Le Prince's. While Edison was long rumoured to be involved in Le Prince's disappearance, others believed Le Prince's brother never took him to the train station. Because of his disappearance, Le Prince has been unfairly overlooked in cinema history."}, "work": {"id": 100594, "title": "Louis Le Prince", "slug": "louis-le-prince", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180317_G025.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1870", "labels": [40090]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:22:51.901732+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:22:51.901777+11:00"}

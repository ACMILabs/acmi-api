As appetite for more dynamic lantern shows increased, so did the complexity of slides. Levers were incorporated to make children appear to skip, and pulley systems used two discs to create movements like whirling windmills. Rackwork mechanisms made glass discs revolve in opposite directions to show planets orbiting the sun and were used in chromotopes to create hypnotic, kaleidoscopic effects."}, "work": {"id": 100517, "title": "Mechanical magic lantern slides", "slug": "mechanical-magic-lantern-slides", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO179679_MLS_Chromatrope_WithHandle_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40013]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:31:04.017918+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:31:04.017950+11:00"}

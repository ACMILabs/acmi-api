Along for the ride is Charlize Theron, who proves her action credentials and whose character, the fierce Imperator Furiosa, has branded herself into popular psyche and culture alike.\r\n\r\nAfter years in the making George Miller set a bomb under contemporary actions films, abandoning overused CGI for insane practical effects and stunts that thrilled audiences worldwide. Essentially one long furious chase, <i>Fury Road</i> still manages to pack an emotional and visceral wallop and is a surprising feminist parable to boot. Miller essentially handed budding filmmakers a masterclass on action cinema with this one of a kind experience."}, "work": {"id": 113981, "title": "Mad Max: Fury Road", "slug": "mad-max-fury-road", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/183637_MadMaxFuryRoad_TMDB.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "George Miller", "headline_credit": "Australia and United States, 2015", "labels": [53475]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:46:15.924641+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:46:15.924681+11:00"}

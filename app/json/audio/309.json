The Macintosh Classic was released in October 1990 and was the first Macintosh computer to sell for less than $1,000 US dollars, making it one of the most affordable computers on the market at the time. It was really just a cheaper version of the Macintosh SE without as many features, which had been released in 1987, and the Macintosh Classic was seen by some as an attempt to squeeze a few more years out of the earlier model. Part of its reduced cost was due to being made in Singapore, instead of America like previous Macintosh computers. Still, the price and stable operating system made it popular in schools, at home and for small business. "}, "work": {"id": 100283, "title": "Macintosh Classic ", "slug": "macintosh-classic-computer", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000326_MacintoshClassicComputer.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Apple Computer Inc.", "headline_credit": "Singapore, 1991", "labels": [39779]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:24:29.835717+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:24:29.835763+11:00"}

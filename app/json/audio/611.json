Working from Jess Johnson’s complex hand-drawn images, video artist Simon Ward rebirths her 2D images as chimerical 3D animations.\r\n\r\n\"<i>My drawings are meshworks of cultural symbology, humanoid clones, messianic figures and alien runes placed in architectural settings. This practice feeds into installations and collaborations in animation, music, fashion, virtual reality and textile art. These additional mediums bring the world of my drawings into physical and virtual spaces, providing an immersive experience for audiences.</i>\" – Jess Johnson"}, "work": {"id": 100542, "title": "Webwurld", "slug": "jess-johnson-and-simon-ward", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000133_Webwurld_Still2_ACMI.tif.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Jess Johnson and Simon Ward", "headline_credit": "Aotearoa / New Zealand and United States, 2017", "labels": [40038]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:13:41.580243+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:13:41.580274+11:00"}

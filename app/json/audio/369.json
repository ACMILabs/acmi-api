Batteries removed.\n\nIn 1951, Stefan Kudelski, a gifted 22-year-old engineer, developed an extremely high quality, miniature, self-contained audio recorder, which he named simply the “Nagra I”. Nagra is a Polish word meaning “will record”. The interest in his invention was immediate. The Nagra II and III followed in the mid to late ‘50s revolutionizing the world of radio broadcasting, cinema and music.\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to culture and science, the Nagra Company received numerous awards including Oscars® in 1978 and 1991.\n\nToday Nagra enjoys universal fame, and the word “Nagra” describes either an authentic Nagra recorder or is a generic term for a sound recorder.\n\nThe company founded by Stefan Kudelski, has, under the guidance of his son André, become a multinational group with several thousand employees worldwide. In order to develop the audio activity, in 2012 Stefan Kudelski’s children acquired the audio division from the Kudelski Group and formed Audio Technology Switzerland SA."}, "work": {"id": 99491, "title": "Nagra 4.2 Audio Recorder", "slug": "nagra-42-professional-audio-recorder-sn-l8169", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000219_Nagra42ProfessionalAudioRecorder_34closed.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "NAGRA", "headline_credit": "Switzerland, c. 1970s", "labels": [38986]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:38:15.421722+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:38:15.421753+11:00"}

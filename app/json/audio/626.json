Like Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Zeus’ hero armour is bold and bright, emphasising his supernatural qualities. His burnished gold breastplate and swaggering confidence make it clear that he is a god who is used to being admired – perhaps a bit too used to it.\r\n\r\nUnlike Thor, Zeus has been filling his days with excess, basking in the attention of the lesser gods in the Grand Pantheon, seemingly unmotivated to track down Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale). While his hero armour looks heroic on the battlefield, in the context of his decadent, easy lifestyle at the start of the film, the extravagance makes him look less like a living legend, and more like a man who is resting on his extremely golden laurels."}, "work": {"id": 120369, "title": "Zeus costume and lightning bolt", "slug": "zeus-costume-and-lightning-bolt", "thumbnail": null, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59834]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:18:10.271240+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:18:10.271326+11:00"}

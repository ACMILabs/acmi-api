You play as a lamb who escapes ritual sacrifice when you’re saved by a mysterious entity known as The One Who Waits. In return, you create a cult of your own in their name by adventuring deep into the woods to slay their enemies, gather supplies and recruit followers who each have their own personalities.\r\n\r\nBy combining classic dungeon crawling with gentler pastimes like home decoration and base building, <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> poses the questions, ‘What if Animal Crossing was a little bit evil? Or what if Binding of Isaac was kind of adorable?’\r\n\r\nWith an irreverent storyline and cute-creepy aesthetic, <i>Cult of the Lamb</i> was an immediate hit, selling over a million copies in its first week. It was partly developed in our co-working space, ACMI X."}, "work": {"id": 122399, "title": "Cult of the Lamb", "slug": "cult-of-the-lamb", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN192864_PlushLambCultOfTheLamb.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "labels": [61858]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:49:24.826858+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:49:24.826912+11:00"}

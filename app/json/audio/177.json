Overtime, these associations inevitably become subconscious. The wave of electric sound from the 40s onwards transformed not just how people watched movies and how they identified genre, but how they listened to it as well. The otherworldly chords of the theremin became indelibly linked to science fiction, while husband and wife composers Bebe and Louis Barron are credited with creating the first fully realised electronic film score for 50s cult classic <i>Forbidden Planet</i> (1956).

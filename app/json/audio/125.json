From <i>The Kid</i> (1921) to <i>Modern Times</i> (1936), his filmography features groundbreaking and critically acclaimed movies.\r\n\r\nAside from being a writer, director, composer and producer, Chaplin is best known as a comic performer and was the first person to popularise feature-length comedies. His slapstick vagrant character ‘the Tramp’ is one of the most iconic performances in movie history and embodies Chaplin’s compassion for the downtrodden. His films often made fun of the wealthy and powerful, likely contributing to Chaplin being blacklisted from Hollywood in 1948 for having Communist sympathies."}, "work": {"id": 100613, "title": "Charlie Chaplin", "slug": "charlie-chaplin", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180328_G036.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "c. 1925", "labels": [40101]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:43:08.375152+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:43:08.375182+11:00"}

During a screening, the projectionist seamlessly changed film rolls between projectors, loading all ‘even’ reels on one projector and ‘odd’ reels on the other projector.\n\nThis one was used in the small town of Tumbarumba, nestled in the shadow of the Snowy Mountains. From around 1959 until 1965, it was operated by William James Burnell Newman, who ran Valley Theatres.

Tinting was inspired by the translucent lighting gels used in theatre that washed the stage in a single glowing colour. Films were tinted by submerging frames in dye baths that saturated all the areas that werenâ€™t black. Toning, adapted from photographic printing, coloured only the darker areas of a frame. Often, toning and tinting were both used in the one film to create moods, convey emotions and heighten tension. Other times, they were used completely randomly."}, "work": {"id": 100615, "title": "Tinted film", "slug": "tinted-negatives", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P180342_G050.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40103]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:57:05.972641+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:57:05.972687+11:00"}

During a snowstorm, composer Dimitri Shostakovish amps up the dread with the theremin’s high-pitched wail. Invented in 1920 by Russian physicist Léon Theremin, the instrument works by harnessing electricity and has been used in movies ever since, from <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i> (1951) to <i>First Man</i> (2018). In 1932, Australian composer Percy Grainger discovered the instrument (this one is signed by him) and used it to develop compositions that weren’t dictated by scales, rhythms or harmonies."}, "work": {"id": 121910, "title": "Percy Grainger's MOOG Theremin", "slug": "percy-graingers-moog-theremin", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN192499_GraingerMOOGTheremin.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61369]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:46:29.886920+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:46:29.886950+11:00"}

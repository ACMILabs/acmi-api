Aside from heroes saving the day, these film franchises all feature frenetic action sequences filmed on the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera. The key isn’t just the Hollywood-quality 6K resolution (it helps though), but the size of the camera. Filmmakers have strapped them to motorbikes, cars, trucks, boats and even tanks, with their size allowing minimal rigging and creative approaches to capturing breathtaking action. What also helps is that they’re made from carbon fibre/polycarbonate composite material so they’re super strong but also lightweight. First sketched out and designed on 3D CAD (Computer Assisted Design) software, prototypes are then made from 3D prints while the internal components are miniaturised to ensure hand-held use without losing their cinematic quality."}, "work": {"id": 113857, "title": "Pocket Cinema Camera 6K", "slug": "mpl-display-group-pocket-cinema-camera-6k-prototypes", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/GROUP_PocketCamera6K_2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Blackmagic Design", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [53351]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:50:36.240308+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:50:36.240338+11:00"}

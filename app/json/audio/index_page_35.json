Aside from heroes saving the day, these film franchises all feature frenetic action sequences filmed on the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera.

Filmmakers have strapped them to motorbikes, cars, trucks, boats and even tanks, with their size allowing minimal rigging and creative approaches to capturing breathtaking action. What also helps is that they’re made from carbon fibre/polycarbonate composite material so they’re super strong but also lightweight.

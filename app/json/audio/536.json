The acclaimed score by Michael Nyman acts as an extension of Holly Hunter’s character, Ada McGrath. Though Ada never speaks, her treasured piano clearly expresses her emotions, opinions and ideas. Sound defines her character.\r\n\r\nThe piano itself dates from 1825–30 and was shipped to the New Zealand filming location from London. Two replicas were made – a lightweight version that could be carried through the bush for the opening scene at Karekare beach, and one with a steel frame for underwater scenes."}, "work": {"id": 100509, "title": "The Piano", "slug": "the-piano", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181375_G987.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Jane Campion", "headline_credit": "Aotearoa / New Zealand, Australia and France, 1993", "labels": [40005]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:51:22.654949+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:51:22.654979+11:00"}

Sometimes big scenes are too complicated or expensive to film with huge, life-size sets so production teams create detailed miniatures of locations and settings, and then use camera techniques to trick the audience into thinking they’re seeing the real thing.\r\n\r\nThis model represents that approach and references schlocky 1950s sci-fi films, like <i>It Came From Outer Space</i> (1953) and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> (1953), which often used miniatures for their out-of-this-world plots. Miniatures have since been used in blockbusters like <i>Star Wars</i> (1977), <i>Alien</i> (1979) and <i>Batman</i> (1989). Often, they’re created just to be destroyed – like the White House in Roland Emmerich’s <i>Independence Day</i> (1996)."}, "work": {"id": 107660, "title": "Miniature Magic", "slug": "miniature-magic-set", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P182843_UFOMiniatureMagic_Full.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Anthony Lucas and Mark O'Brien", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [47153]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:33:32.024537+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:33:32.024565+11:00"}

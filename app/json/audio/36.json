Picture Nicole Kidman, unrecognisable as Virginia Woolf in her Oscar-winning role in <i>The Hours</i> (2002), or Heath Ledger, who was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for playing the savagely scarred Joker in <i>The Dark Knight</i> (2008). Those iconic transformations are all done through extensive makeup and hairstyling coupled with prosthetics, like the kind that Australian company Odd Studio used to win an Oscar for their work on <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> (2015).  \r\n\r\nHere Odd Studio demonstrate their skills by turning a young woman into a witch. The process involves sketching, sculpting, blasting, plastering and painting a variety of materials like silicone, alginate and clay into replicas and moulds that transform actors into all variety of shapes, faces and features."}, "work": {"id": 100868, "title": "Prosthetic Transformations", "slug": "prosthetic-transformations", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P181528_G461_thumbnail.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Odd Studio", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2020", "labels": [40356]}, "created": "2024-02-08T10:13:26.443230+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T10:13:26.443273+11:00"}

Featuring simple colours and bold, stencilled shapes, Risograph printing is popular with artists, designers and zine makers but its dreamy simplicity is deceptive – like <i>NUTS</i>, much more goes into the style than just cuteness and colour blocking.\r\n\r\n<i>NUTS</i> takes a darker turn when the player realises that shady developers are using the endangered squirrel’s behaviour patterns to assess the site of a proposed dam. After uncovering clues, players learn that the forced removal of animals from their habitat will have dire environmental consequences."}, "work": {"id": 120330, "title": "NUTS", "slug": "nuts", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P190399_Img_Gradients.png.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Noodlecake Studios", "headline_credit": "Australia, Denmark and Iceland, 2019", "labels": [59795]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:42:50.590178+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:42:50.590221+11:00"}

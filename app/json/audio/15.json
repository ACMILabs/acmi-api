In this large-scale presentation, you can see the threads of life that exist around and inside us. Vitally, <i>We Live in an Ocean of Air</i> provides an alternative platform to view the challenges our planet faces in the 21st century and helps us to reflect on our dependence and responsibility to the organisms we share the Earth with."}, "work": {"id": 122500, "title": "We Live in an Ocean of Air", "slug": "we-live-in-an-ocean-of-air-video-edition", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_We_Live_In_An_Ocean_of_Air_Courtesy_of_artists_2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Marshmallow Laser Feast", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2022", "labels": [61958]}, "created": "2023-11-16T17:05:42.292765+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-12T13:17:04.256934+11:00"}

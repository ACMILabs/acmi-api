Vitally, it provides an alternative platform to view the challenges our planet faces in the twenty-first century and helps us to reflect on our dependence and responsibility to the organisms we share it with.\r\n\r\nFrom the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe, humanity’s dependence on the natural world is absolute. The protection and regeneration of ecosystems is fundamental to our collective futures. Marshmallow Laser Feast confront these issues head on through a magical and moving experience – and invite you to join them on it."}, "work": {"id": 122500, "title": "We Live in an Ocean of Air", "slug": "we-live-in-an-ocean-of-air-video-edition", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_We_Live_In_An_Ocean_of_Air_Courtesy_of_artists_2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Marshmallow Laser Feast", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2022", "labels": [61958]}, "created": "2023-11-16T17:05:42.292765+11:00", "updated": "2023-11-16T17:05:42.292797+11:00"}

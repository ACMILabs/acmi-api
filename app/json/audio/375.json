At its centre is Whiskey, a dancing queen with an entourage of seven kungka kunpu (strong women) from her community in Indulkana, who act as back-up for a superstar tearing through red-sand roads in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Along for the party are actual superheroes and superstars – Wonder Woman and Tina Turner materialise in Whiskey’s live-action dreamscape, appearing via vivid animation rendered in her lively, singular style.\n\n[Sourced from ACMI website 3/2/22]"}, "work": {"id": 120000, "title": "Ngura Pukulpa – Happy Place", "slug": "ngura-pukulpa-happy-place", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000190_Still_Gold1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Kaylene Whiskey", "headline_credit": "Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands, South Australia, Australia, 2021", "labels": [59465]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:41:48.331388+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:41:48.331443+11:00"}

Presented for PHOTO 2022 International Festival of Photography, Wearing turns the lens on herself to contemplate the nature of ageing in the contemporary world.\r\n\r\nAfter asking collaborators to imagine how she might look aged 70, Wearing used artificial intelligence and age-processing tools to depict her possible future selves. Printed on wallpaper, these huge self-portraits highlight the unpredictability of time, revealing the limitations of what we believe to be pioneering technology and further emphasising the uncertainty of what lies ahead.\r\n\r\nOn-screen we meet a series of strangers who appear to look like the artist. Collaborating with advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, Wearing used deepfake technology to map her own face onto volunteers who replied to a newspaper ad. The film asks us to question the tensions of living in an increasingly media-saturated world and how reality can be easily distorted."}, "work": {"id": 120106, "title": "Gillian Wearing: Editing Life", "slug": "editing-life", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/RockNRoll70.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Gillian Wearing", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom", "labels": [59571]}, "created": "2024-02-08T11:04:01.536561+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T11:04:01.536591+11:00"}

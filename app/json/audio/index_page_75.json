Then, it transitions to a lively scene of people swimming in the water. A capture follows of a woman and a child balancing on a log in the water. The footage then focuses on groups of people frolicking in the water, passing a beach ball around, demonstrating pure vacation fun. A woman and two children make a delightful appearance, engaged in aquatic play. The scene shifts to a solitary man on a boat in dim light, and then he is shown standing on the side of the boat. The video concludes with a serene shot of a woman and two children on a dock.\n\nA man is seen sitting on a boat in darkness. The boat drifts gently on the water. Suddenly, the scene changes to a white clock on a black background."}, "work": null, "created": "2023-10-23T10:12:52.994547+11:00", "updated": "2023-10-23T10:12:52.994601+11:00"}, {"id": 2, "resource": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/video/122462.wav", "transcription": {"text": "Minyak Sawit Keluarga (Palm Oil Family), examines her paternal family’s history of farming practices in rural Southern Malaysia.

I want us to be seen, to have a say that enables us to take back control.”\n\nJarra Karalinar Steel conjures the nostalgic excitement of 1990s videogame arcades in More Than Just a Game. At its centre is The Adventures of Dolly, a playable game made with Wiradjuri and Ngiyampaa illustrator Charlotte Allingham. Take the controls and take Dolly on a journey through an alternate reality or not-so-distant future of Melbourne’s CBD, featuring iconic trams and Swanston Street.Growing up, videogame protagonists weren’t relatable to Jarra.\n\nThis work remedies that, giving First Peoples a chance to see ourselves imagined in a videogame – made for us, by us. Through The Adventures of Dolly, custom possum and wallaby spirit flooring and the hand-carved arcade cabinet, Jarra reclaims a place that hasn’t reflected our experiences. She brings Indigenous stories into gaming, inspiring the next generation and giving us power to determine our own futures."}, "work": {"id": 121855, "title": "More Than Just a Game", "slug": "more-than-just-a-game", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Z000201_ArcadePromo.PNG.1200x1200_q85.png", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Jarra Karalinar Steel", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2022", "labels": [61314]}, "created": "2023-09-04T18:09:38.607207+10:00", "updated": "2023-09-04T18:09:38.607259+10:00"}]}

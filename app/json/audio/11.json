We then see a 1940s factory with a crane operator, and a tall tower against a moody purple sky. Next, we observe a bridge being built with another crane. We also see workers from the 1940s at a construction site. Interestingly, a sequence shows a boat being lifted on a dock and over a river. In one scene, we see a man on a bridge holding a red balloon. The video finishes with a crane lifting a large object over a building.\n\nIn this scene, two large cranes are lifting heavy objects, including a sizeable metal piece, into the air, over a bridge. A man stands near the action, even flying a kite for a moment. As a boat moves under the bridge, a man with a camera joins him. Eventually, one more person arrives, and they all stand together on the bridge in the darkness."}, "work": null, "created": "2023-11-13T15:04:27.304971+11:00", "updated": "2023-11-13T15:04:27.305005+11:00"}

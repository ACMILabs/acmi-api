Max Rockatansky’s journey dispensing justice across the wasteland in his V8 Interceptor became a cult classic and catapulted Australian cinema onto the world stage.\r\n\r\nBursting with stunning practical effects, explosive set pieces and iconic costumes, the original <i>Mad Max</i> trilogy (1979–85) cemented its place in pop culture. Thirty years later it roared back onto screens with a ‘reimagining’ featuring instantly classic new characters like Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and the War Boys.\r\n\r\n<i>Mad Max</i>’s super-powered vehicles, legendary characters and post-apocalyptic setting influenced everything from movies, manga and music videos to fashion, videogames and art, spawning enough parodies, homages and clones to fill a Thunderdome."}, "work": {"id": 107804, "title": "Mad Max V8 Interceptor car replica", "slug": "mad-max-v8-interceptor-replica", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P183279_ReplicaMadMaxInterceptor.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Cameron Manewell", "headline_credit": "Australia, 2019", "labels": [47297]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:32:39.246453+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:32:39.246521+11:00"}

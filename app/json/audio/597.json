Early filmmakers experimented with sound but couldn’t match it perfectly with motion pictures. The Vitaphone solved that, creating synchronised playback through a vinyl disc manually linked to a film projector. The system received wide-spread acclaim from its use in the first Vitaphone feature, <i>Don Juan</i> (1926), which featured a synced score from the New York Philharmonic and sound effects, and then a year later in <i>The Jazz Singer</i>, the first film to feature dialogue. Warner Brothers billed the Vitaphone as “the marvel of this marvellous age” and it certainly ushered in a new one: the success of <i>Don Juan</i> and <i>The Jazz Singer</i> signalled the end of silent cinema."}, "work": {"id": 100617, "title": "Vitaphone discs", "slug": "vitaphone-discs", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/E000269_VitaphoneDisc_TheVitaphoneCorporationCharles_Hackett392ReelThreeDate9-1TimesPlayed2.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [40105]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:09:11.532282+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:09:11.532324+11:00"}

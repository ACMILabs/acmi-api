Gertrude reappears on Tilly’s balcony, wearing this gorgeous dress, designed by Tilly.\r\n\r\nThe dress shows Tilly’s skill and sophistication, and the superiority of her designs in direct contrast to the bad wedding dress. Inspired by Dior, this dress elevates Gertrude’s figure. As its designer Marion Boyce has said, it has that “va-va-voom” quality."}, "work": {"id": 122358, "title": "Gertrude Pratt's (Sarah Snook) silver dress from The Dressmaker", "slug": "silver-dress-worn-by-gertrude-pratt-sarah-snook", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN194729_Dressmaker_SilverWiggleDress.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [61817]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:24:10.774090+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:24:10.774121+11:00"}

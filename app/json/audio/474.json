Scott was inspired by imagery in several of these books. Futurist and industrial designer Syd Mead also contributed, helping design the sci-fi world around the cars.   \r\n\r\nSpinner models were filmed against a black screen and then superimposed on the model shots of LA. Three life-size versions of the spinners were also created. These flew on wires that were later painted out of the shots, while interior shots were filmed against a green screen."}, "work": {"id": 100872, "title": "Special effects in Blade Runner (Spinners)", "slug": "special-effects-in-blade-runner-spinners", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P179117_DoAndroidsDreamBook_34.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Ridley Scott", "headline_credit": "United States, 1982", "labels": [40360]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:28:07.092238+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:28:07.092268+11:00"}

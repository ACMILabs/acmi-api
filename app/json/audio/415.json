It consists of a cylinder and a strip of paper showing twelve frames for animation. As the cylinder rotates, stationary mirrors in the centre reveal a ‘single image’ in motion. The Praxinoscope was invented in 1876 by Charles-Émile Reynaud (1844-1918), a Paris science teacher, who marked all his examples ‘E.R.’. The toy became a great commercial success and won recognition at the great exhibitions of the period.\n\nThe Praxinoscope was awarded the Bronze Medal at the Universal Exhibition, 1889 and a Silver Medal at the 1879 Exhibition. The label reads \"in the evening, place a candle on the candle holder in the center, a candle with 'lampshade'. Fix the ends of the drawing against the bar which projects inside the crown\" (loose translation)"}, "work": {"id": 99446, "title": "Praxinoscope with wooden base", "slug": "praxinoscope", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO175951_Praxinoscope_Front.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "France, c. 1889-1900", "labels": [38941]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:58:52.656590+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:58:52.656619+11:00"}

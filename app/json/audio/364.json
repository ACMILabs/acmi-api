It’s a fun, family-friendly release; a chaotic co-operative game for multiple players that prides itself on inclusive design, including dyslexic-friendly fonts and adjustable difficulty settings, as well as options to create a character who wears a hijab or uses a wheelchair.\r\n\r\nThe game encourages players to work together to move increasingly complex pieces of furniture from maze-like houses, farms, gardens, factories and other arenas into the moving truck within the time limit. While it does have a single-player mode, it’s designed to be played with others, as you’ll need someone to help pick up each end of the couch, stove, hay bale or other objects that need to be moved."}, "work": {"id": 122421, "title": "Moving Out (2020)", "slug": "moving-out-2020", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/LN192866_MovingOutCube.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "labels": [61880]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:35:44.073465+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:35:44.073497+11:00"}

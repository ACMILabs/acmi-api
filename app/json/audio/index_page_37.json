Together with Turner, he transformed the genre of landscape painting in England.\r\n\r\nConstable’s late monumental paintings sealed his reputation as one of Britain’s greatest landscape artists. In the last decade of his life, he devoted great effort to creating a series of prints based on works from across his career. In the text he wrote to accompany these prints, Constable presented himself as ‘an innovator’ who had transformed visual art by adding to it ‘qualities of Nature unknown to it before’.\r\n\r\nYounger artist John Linnell (1792–1882) became a prominent rival of Constable.

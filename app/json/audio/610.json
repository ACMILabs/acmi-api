The player controls a little spider whose design (and dance moves) are inspired by the Peacock spider, solving environmental puzzles by strategically building webs to navigate the native flora of Jagera and Turrbal Country, where the game was made. As the player navigates the terrain, from subterranean ants’ nests to treetop native beehives, the game showcases a variety of lovingly drawn insect and arthropod homes."}, "work": {"id": 122413, "title": "Webbed  (2021)", "slug": "webbed-2021", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/P193350_SpiderPlushie.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "Australia", "labels": [61872]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:13:04.994279+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:13:04.994314+11:00"}

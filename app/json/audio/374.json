Together with Turner, he transformed the genre of landscape painting in England.\r\n\r\nConstable’s late monumental paintings sealed his reputation as one of Britain’s greatest landscape artists. In the last decade of his life, he devoted great effort to creating a series of prints based on works from across his career. In the text he wrote to accompany these prints, Constable presented himself as ‘an innovator’ who had transformed visual art by adding to it ‘qualities of Nature unknown to it before’.\r\n\r\nYounger artist John Linnell (1792–1882) became a prominent rival of Constable. He aimed to record the world around him as accurately as possible, paying careful attention to the effects of light. Rejecting bucolic scenes, his choice of subject matter was unusual for the period.\r\n\r\n自然之光\r\n\r\n约翰·康斯特布尔（1776—1837）对自然和天空的变幻效果进行了细致的研究。他和透纳一起改变了英格兰风景绘画的风格。\r\n\r\n康斯特布尔晚期的重要绘画奠定了他作为英国最伟大风景画家之一的声誉。在他生命的最后十年，他在自己职业生涯不同时期的作品基础上，投入巨大精力创作了一系列版画作品。康斯特布尔在为这些版画所写的文字中，将自己描述为“一名创新者”，他将“自然界前所未有的品质”添加到视觉艺术中，从而改变了视觉艺术。\r\n\r\n更年轻一代的艺术家约翰·林内尔（1792—1882）成为了康斯特布尔的有力竞争对手。他的目标是尽可能地高度还原现实世界，仔细观察光的效果。他拒绝描绘田园风光，而是选择了在当时并不寻常的题材。"}, "work": {"id": 120229, "title": "Natural Light", "slug": "natural-light", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/N01813_P.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "", "headline_credit": "", "labels": [59694]}, "created": "2024-02-08T12:41:14.081442+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T12:41:14.081471+11:00"}

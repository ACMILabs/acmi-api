For centuries these puppets have danced across screens and told stories, teaching philosophical, moral and aesthetic values through indigenous myths, ancient Indian epics and local legends.\r\n\r\nIntricately perforated and elaborately painted, these puppets are made from leather, bamboo and ox horn, and they cast dazzling shadows when silhouetted against walls or translucent cloths. The <i>dalang</i>, or puppeteer, uses rods to bring the characters to life in performances that are often accompanied by chanting, singing and gamelan."}, "work": {"id": 100539, "title": "Wayang shadow puppets", "slug": "wayang-shadow-puppets", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/AEO178586_left.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Putro Wayang Puppet Workshop and Oil Painting", "headline_credit": "Indonesia, 2019", "labels": [40035]}, "created": "2024-02-08T14:11:51.054423+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T14:11:51.054453+11:00"}

The artwork seeks to foster a sense of belonging to a more-than-human world. \r\n\r\nAs we peer through the layers of the tree, we uncover the vibrancy of the life flowing through and beyond its body. The flow of nutrients in its phloem pulse to your heartbeat and reverberates through the room. This pulsing draws you in on a journey from the crown to the roots, climaxing in rivers of carbon in the soil. Here we meet the woven mycelial bridge between land and the sky: in this network of mycorrhizal fungi we see that no self is bounded â€“ we are all porous, enmeshed and entangled."}, "work": {"id": 122479, "title": "Sanctuary of the Unseen Forest", "slug": "sanctuary-of-the-unseen-forest", "thumbnail": {"image_url": "https://acmi-public-api.s3.amazonaws.com/image/Marshmallow_Laser_Feast_Sanctuary_of_the_Unseen_Forest_Courtesy_of_artists_and_Sandra_Ciampone_1.jpg.1200x1200_q85.jpg", "has_video": false}, "creator_credit": "Marshmallow Laser Feast", "headline_credit": "United Kingdom, 2022", "labels": [61937]}, "created": "2024-02-08T13:14:41.729662+11:00", "updated": "2024-02-08T13:14:41.729693+11:00"}
